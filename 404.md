# 404: Page not found

Sorry, either I misplaced that URL or it's pointing to something that doesn't exist. [Here's all my blog posts]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/blog.md %}), maybe you'll find it there.
  
Maybe you were never meant to find that page, and instead you were meant to see this page.

I aspire for this page to be in the top 50% of 404 pages you've seen in the last four weeks. 

Is it? 

What makes for a good 404 page? 

To deliver a message, perhaps. Maybe of disappointment, maybe of good news. 

Here's a message of disappointment: the person that invented 'American style zoning', as I call it (also known as euclidean zoning) was a supremacist. It's _his_ world we all live in. 

To live in an american city is to be subjected to a [supremacist, dehumanizing, violent way of being]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2020-08-17-1922-atlanta-zoning-plan-with-comments.md %}).

This particular form of social control was known as so convenient it's spread far beyond the USA. But once you know what 'euclidean style zoning is' and can recognize it, you will see the world as dripping in slavery, oppression, control, and violence. 

A message of something else?

Check out this concept of a [traffic bean](https://zoningverydifferentthanours.substack.com/p/a-pattern-of-repair-the-traffic-bean), as a full drop-in replacement for signalized intersections. (I wrote that piece, don't be tricked by it being on a different platform. The best/worst of my tone undoubtedly still shines through)

If you every have to interact with american roads, I am sorry for you, if I could gift you a series of traffic beans along the major intersections of your usual routes, I would. 

> but josh as I think about it right now that would not work because...

Gosh, you might be so right. Where traffic beans don't work, how about those intersections/segments [get a good coning](https://josh.works/on-coning).

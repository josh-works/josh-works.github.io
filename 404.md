# 404: Page not found

Sorry, either I misplaced that URL or it's pointing to something that doesn't exist. [Here's all my blog posts]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/blog.md %}), maybe you'll find it there.
  
Maybe you were never meant to find that page, and instead you were meant to see this page.

I aspire for this page to be in the top 50% of 404 pages you've seen in the last four weeks. 

Is it? 

What makes for a good 404 page? 

To deliver a message, perhaps. Maybe of disappointment, maybe of good news.

[3:59 PM, 10/27/2020] William Hinrichs: Hey Josh, amendment B, am I correct in that passing amendment B will repeal the gallagher amendments thereby forcing homeowners to pay a property tax based on the value of their home instead of keeping it tied to the value of non-residential property? As in, it will make homeowners pay the state for the value of their homes/land?
[4:00 PM, 10/27/2020] William Hinrichs: Oof, that's brutal. That is specifically brutal for poor homeowners (if I'm reading this correctly)
[4:02 PM, 10/27/2020] Josh Thompson: whoaaaaa
[4:03 PM, 10/27/2020] William Hinrichs: It's statutory, so I assume it's on your ballot as well? Not just Denver, right?
[4:03 PM, 10/27/2020] Josh Thompson: yeah, I'd not even looked into it very hard, but I'm reading this now (https://www.denverpost.com/2020/10/07/colorado-amendment-b-gallagher-repeal/) and it looks like a simple money grab.

The state ruins the market, drives all revenue up, but right now commercial properties are tanking, so the state knows it's revenue is about to tank too.
[4:04 PM, 10/27/2020] Josh Thompson: I suspect it'll pass, because for a law this distasteful to end up on the ballot, it must have gotten ushered in.

And if they ushered it in, they'll make it pass.

### Email 1, send immediately 

Recently, I wrote https://josh.works/whats-up-with-anabaptistsâ€‹

I shared it around a bit, with a small group of trusted individuals. Some are followers of Christ, some are not. 

I got a lot of interesting comments in response, with everyone saying more-or-less "Keep me posted as you do your research!"

So, I'll keep you posted. 

This email thing is a bit of an unusual format. If you recived the URL to this page from me, directly, it means I desire your feedback. This format strikes the balance I'm looking for between 'public' and 'private' correspondence.

I write publically (on my website) or semi-publically, in these emails, and I hope you'll make judicious use of the `reply` button, and reply to every single email. 

If you didn't get the URL to this page from me directly, but rather from someone else, that means they found it interesting enough to share with you, and I would be eager for your participation in this little project as well.

I will seek to write in a way that tis measured, generous, and welcoming. I seek to live my life after the example of Jesus Christ. 

Jesus Christ offended many people of his day, especially the religious leaders of the day. Don't forget - the story, as we followers of Christ like to tell, is:

_He was so offensive and odious to the religions and political authorities of the day that they found themselves united in almost nothing but a desire to kill him. So, they worked together to do just that._

It's likely that I'll offend you at some point in the near future with what I write. When this happens, you've got a few options:

1. Reply to one of these emails and offer correction.
2. Ignore the offense, keep reading the emails as they come out. (maintaining some mix of _benefit of the doubt_ and _curiosity_).
3. Take to FB/Twitter/Whatever, quote me (in or out of context), and enlist your community in tearing whatever I said to pieces.

The people that I personally invite to this list fall into buckets 1 and 2, and in doing so, continue to rise 

The later arrivals, whoever you are, as referred by a friend, will hopefully _also_ fall into buckets 1 and 2. I'm not really opposed to option 3, but I would rather options 1 & 2.

- Josh

PS To make it extremely clear: I invited you to this list so I can have conversation about an important and timely topic, _quickly_, with people who I trust. Please respond to these emails. 

Lets practice. Hit the "reply" button, and tell me what you know about anabaptists today?

It's ok if the answer is "not much". That's where I was when I started this.

<h1>A Little CSS Goes a Long Way</h1>

<p>I wanted to learn some basic styling. I've done back-end development most of my professional career, hardly ever had to weigh in on the front-end.</p>

<p>But, over here on my own personal website, I've got a bunch of modifications I want to make.</p>
  
<p>Specifically, I want come up with a way to add footnotes and annotations to my own writing. Maybe something similar to how Nate Berkopec (<a href="https://www.nateberkopec.com/blog/2019/12/17/year-in-review.html">example</a>) or Tim Urban (<a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/09/thinking-ladder.html">example</a>) does it. </p>

<p>So, I'm here to talk about styling, html, css, and javascript, but what is <a id="showContent" href="#content">more important than all of those things?</a></p>
</section>

<section id="content" class="step1 hidden">
  <h1>Words! Feelings! Information!</h1>
  <p>Certainly many websites deliver things besides words (Netflix, Youtube) but I'd argue most of stuff we do on the web comes down to reading text.</p>
  <p>For example, you're reading this text right now</p>
  <p>These words are sometimes called "content", but I would argue that labeling this as simple 'content' undervalues what is happening here.</p>
  <p>See, people are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics">memetic</a></p>
  <p>Without going too far into this, I'm broadly classifying this as "people are strongly influenced by ideas and beliefs, and ideas and beliefs can spread through a person's mind and a group of people just like a virus might."</p>
  <p>But the best words, the most compelling ideas, if presented in an unreadable way, will fail to have an effect.</p>
  <p>as a proof of concept, when is the last time you've found an idea, written in Thai, to shape your daily actions?</p>
  <p>Probably never, unless you happen to be a Thai speaker.</p>
  <p>Parenthetically, it causes me discomfort to think of all amazing ideas and stories in the world, that are amazing precicely because the author/story-teller has no knowledge of English.</p>
  <p>I will never know these ideas, because we cannot converse directly with each other.</p>
  <p>Anyway, we ought to care about legibility.</p>
  <p>To that end, lets improve the styling here a little bit.</p>
  
  <p>in our styles.css document:</p>
 
  <pre>
    body {
      margin: 0 auto;
      max-width: 50em;
    }

  </pre>

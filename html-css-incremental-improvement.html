<h1>A Little CSS Goes a Long Way</h1>
<section id="start">

  <p><a href="/">by Josh Thompson</a></p>

  <p><em>heavily inspired by and copied from <a href="https://jgthms.com/web-design-in-4-minutes/">Web Design in 4 Min (jgthms.com)</a></em></p>

  <p>I wanted to learn some basic styling. I've done back-end development most of my professional career, hardly ever had to weigh in on the front-end.</p>

  <p>But, over here on my own personal website, I've got a bunch of modifications I want to make.</p>
  
  <p>Specifically, I want come up with a way to add footnotes and annotations to my own writing. Maybe something similar to how Nate Berkopec (<a href="https://www.nateberkopec.com/blog/2019/12/17/year-in-review.html">example</a>) or Tim Urban (<a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/09/thinking-ladder.html">example</a>) does it. </p>

  <p>So, I'm here to talk about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but what is <a class="step" data-step="0" href="#content">more important than all of those things?</a></p>
</section>

<section id="content" class="hidden">
  <h2>Words, Ideas, and Memes</h2>
  <p>Certainly many websites deliver things besides words (Netflix, Youtube) but I'd argue most of stuff we do on the web comes down to reading text.</p>
  <p>For example, you're reading this text right now</p>
  <p>Let's improve the readability a little bit, by limiting the line length.</p>
  <p>in our <code>styles.css</code> document:</p>
  <pre>
    body {
      margin: 0 auto;
      max-width: 50em;
    }
  </pre>
  <p>(If you're on mobile, you won't see a difference)</p>
  <p>It's important that words be easily read, and easily understood, as far as is possible.</p>
  <p>These words are sometimes called "content", but I would argue that labeling this as simple 'content' undervalues what is happening here.</p>
  <p>See, people are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics">memetic</a>.</p>
  <p>I'm broadly defining "people are memetic" as <em>people are strongly influenced by ideas and beliefs, and ideas and beliefs can spread through a person's mind and a group of people just like a virus might.</em>
  <p>But the best words, the most infectious ideas, if presented in an unreadable way, will fail to have an effect.</p>
  
  <p>à¸„à¸™à¹ƒà¸ˆà¸”à¸µà¹„à¸¡à¹ˆà¸„à¸§à¸£à¸†à¹ˆà¸²à¸„à¸™à¹ƒà¸ˆà¸”à¸µ</p>
  <p>What do you think of this idea? Is it compelling? Do you agree or disagree? What about edge cases? It's mostly true but not always?</p>
  <p>Unless you happen to be a Thai speaker (or are quick with Google Translate) you have no idea if this is a "contageous" idea, a good idea, a bad idea, or anything else about it.</p>
  <p>Parenthetically, it causes me discomfort to think of all amazing ideas and stories in the world, that are amazing precicely because the author/story-teller has no knowledge of English.</p>
  <p>I will never know these ideas, because we cannot converse directly with each other.</p>
  <p>Anyway, we ought to care about legibility.</p>
  <p>Besides limiting the line length, we ought to 
    <a class="step" data-step="1" href="#text-styling">style the text itself.</a></p>
</section>

<section id="text-styling" class="hidden">
  <h2>Lose the serifs</h2>
  I prefer a font without serifs, or "san-serif". Lets add to our <code>styles.css</code> the following:
  
  <pre>
    body: {
      font-family: "Helvetica", "Arial", sans-serif;
    }
  </pre>
  
  <p>But now, the text feels a little crowded, don't you think? Especially on long lines where the words wrap without line breaks. This paragraph is getting to be rather long, and it's feeling crowded already. If I had the audacity to make this paragraph multiple (long) sentances long, the way it would wrap would make it more than just a daunting block of text to wade into -- it would make it hard for the eye to follow along and avoid skipping up and down.</p>
  <p><a class="step" data-step="2" href="#spacing">What to you need beyond a better font?</a></p>
</section>

<section id="spacing" class="hidden">
  <h2>Text Spacing</h2>
  <p>By adding a little whitespace here and there, the text can "breath". See how the long lines wrap with a little more space between them? It helps the eye follow along on the current line instead of jumping above or below.</p>
  <p>I know some die-hard readers insist that the text should be dense, and the form factor doesn't matter, but this is my website, so I can do whatever I want. ðŸ˜„</p>
  
  <pre>
  body {
    line-height: 1.5;
    padding: 4em 1em;
  }
  
  h2 {
    margin-top: 1em;
    padding-top: 1em;
  }
  </pre>
  
  <p>Now that we have spacing sorted, what might help present information in a more compelling and easily-digested way? That's right. <a class="step" data-step="3" href="#color-and-contrast">Modify the color and the contrast!</a>.</p>
</section>

<section id="color-and-contrast" class="hidden">
  <h2>Color and Contrast</h2>
  <p>Now code blocks are set apart visually from the rest of the page.</p>
  
  <pre>
    code,
    pre {
      background: #eee;
    }

    code {
      padding: 2px 4px;
      vertical-align: text-bottom;
    }

    pre {
      padding: 1em;
    }
  </pre>
  <a class="step" data-step="4" href="#style-those-links">Lets style the links</a>
</section>


<section id="style-those-links" class="hidden">
  <h2>Style the Links</h2>
  
  The default link color isn't great, and it varies based on if you've clicked it before. Doesn't look great, so lets standardize our links on something that looks a bit nicer:
  <p>Lets upgrade the links:</p>
  
  <pre>
  a {
    color: #268bd2;
    text-decoration: none;
  }

  a:hover,
  a:focus {
    text-decoration: underline;
  }
  </pre>
  
  <p>Next <a class="step" data-step="5" href="#upgrade-code-blocks">lets upgrade our code blocks.</a></p>
</section>


<section id="upgrade-code-blocks" class="hidden">
  <h2>Upgrade the code blocks</h2>
  <p>The code blocks are still kinda bland. We can add subtle accents to the left side and bottom:</p>
  
  <pre>
    html.step6 code,
    html.step6 pre {
      background: #f5f7f9;
      border-bottom: 1px solid #d8dee9;
      color: #a7adba;
    }

    html.step6 pre {
      border-left: 2px solid #69c;
    }
  </pre>
  <p>Reveal the next step: <a class="step" data-step="n" href="#next-section">clickable text for next section</a></p>
</section>

<section id="current-section" class="hidden">
  <h2>Section Title</h2>
  <p>Words about this section</p>

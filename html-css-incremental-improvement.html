<p>I wanted to learn some basic styling. I've done back-end development most of my professional career, hardly ever had to weigh in on the front-end.</p>

<p>But, over here on my own personal website, I've got a bunch of modifications I want to make.</p>
  
<p>Specifically, I want come up with a way to add footnotes and annotations to my own writing. Maybe something similar to how Nate Berkopec (<a href="https://www.nateberkopec.com/blog/2019/12/17/year-in-review.html">example</a>) or Tim Urban (<a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/09/thinking-ladder.html">example</a>) does it. </p>

<p>So, I'm here to talk about styling, html, css, and javascript, but what is <a id="showContent" href="#content">more important than all of those things?</a></p>

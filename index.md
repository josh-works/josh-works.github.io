# Welcome!

I'm Josh. I do a mix of things, mostly related to software development, rock climbing, and helping software developers and rock climbers be better at what they do. 

My wife and I are based in Golden, CO. 

# What I'm working on right now

I am always interested in what people are working on _right now_. Maybe not urgently, but at least enoug that they think about it every week or two. If you have a project that you think I can help with, I'd love to hear about it: `joshthompson@hey.com`

I am working on two things:

## \#1 Building out `IntermediateRuby`

I'm working on helping early-career ruby/rails software developers more quickly grow their skills. 

I'm doing this here:

If any of what's above (or what you read below) is of interest to you, I'll probably mention it sometime soon to folks who are following along via email:

I'd love for you to join:

Hi there, I'm Josh. 

I've got way more projects than I have time and energy, but here's the threads that tie much of my work together:

- Software
- Teaching
- Writing

## Projects 

### 1. Software development coaching and training at [intermediateruby.com](https://intermediateruby.com/)

I help early-career Ruby/Rails software developers more quickly grow their skills and ability to deliver value. 

I do 1:1 coaching and small-group training. Intrigued? [Let's talk about it]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/work-together.md %})

### software consulting/implementation 

I operate at both the strategic/consulting level _and_ the tactical/implementation level. Depending on the level, I write words for either people or machines.

### Helping my hometown of Golden, CO legalize an authentic and beautiful architectural style

This project is far and away the most impactful and potentially valuable project I've ever worked on. 

Most of my writing is focused on this issue, and I'm experimenting with an interesting medium for telling a story.

I use an email campaign as my experimental medium. 

> Email isn't original at all, Josh. üôÑ 

I know, I know! It's not email _per se_, it's how I've structured the information within the email.

If you sign up today, you'll get about 15 emails before "catching up" with what I'm writing to the list right now.

It's an interesting format, but I've had an absolute blast, and lots of thoughtful people from the internet have written me interesting and helpful responses.

I'd _love_ for you join. It'll make sense soon.

### What this newsletter is about[#](#what-this-newsletter-is-about)

Here's a teaser of what we will discuss in the newsletter.

Compare these two images:

![subsidized and ugly - fully crop](/images_2020/subsidized-cropped.jpg)

![illegal but beautiful](/images_2020/illegal.jpg)

I live in Golden, CO, and what's true in Charleston, South Carolina is true in Golden, Colorado. 

> Josh, why is this "local and authentic" building style _illegal_?

Great question!. It's a bit of a winding story, which is why it takes a few emails to unpack.

There's three classes of laws that make the beautiful urbanism illegal:

1. Mandatory minimum parking laws
1. Minimum setback laws
1. Minimum lot size laws

I'd like to help fix all three of these barriers, and I literally[^literally-not-figuratively] cannot do it without you. 

And if you are skeptical of what I'm trying to do? Or you'd rather read about software and not urban design? I'd recommend experimenting with the newsletter despite these reservations:

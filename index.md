ðŸ‘‹, I'm Josh.

This website serves as scratch pad for my ideas and words.

I value coherence, meaningfulness, compassion, and kindness.

Overall, I care a lot about "cities", the built urban form, transportation networks, and how issues of morality and ethics play out in these domains.

America is full of this:

I desire to nudge the ecosytem towards producing more of this:

![illegal but beautiful](/images_2020/illegal.jpg)

Pretty much all forms of human flourishing go up, and many forms of human suffering become less, when the landscape looks more like what is labeled as 'illegal in charleston'.

Also, the `cost per square meter` and `value per square meter` of these two competing visions are quite different.

I'm currently working on nudging this ecosystem in a variety of ways, and always interested in increasing my impact. Please [email me](mailto: myfirstnamemylastname@hey.com) if you want to discuss any opportunities.

Overall, I aim to combine/embody the influences of several distinctive persons, most specifically Alain Bertaud[^data-driven-urban-economist] and Christopher Alexander[^design-patterns].

## Footnotes

[^data-driven-urban-economist]: Alain Bertaud wrote [this book]() and [this paper](). He and Marie-Agnes are the subjects of [this podcast](). Sometimes his domain overlaps with 'american urban planning', but for a few reasons, he's not exactly been welcomed into their domain. You and I will make sure he gets welcomed into _your_ domain. 

[^design-patterns]:  Christopher Alexander basically formalized the concept of `design patterns`, in both architecture AND computer science!!! He reminds me of [Claude Shannon](https://josh.works/driven-by-compression-progress-novelty-humor-interestingness-curiosity-creativity#fn:shannon). 

    Design patterns, as he conceived of them, are at the core of the object-oriented software development I use most days (Ruby/Rails), _and_ design patterns are at the core of his contribution to architecture and physical spaces. I had known Christopher Alexander for years as the author of [A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Language-Buildings-Construction-Environmental/dp/0195019199), and had always tried to channel the same ideas when working on software projects. 
    
    Only in the last year did I learn of [his influence in computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander#Computer_science). He passed away in late 2022, and [this eulogy](https://dorian.substack.com/p/at-any-given-moment-in-a-process?s=r) is perhaps the best introduction to this incredible person.

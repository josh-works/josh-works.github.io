ðŸ‘‹, I'm Josh. 

This website serves as a bit of a public scratch pad for many diverse things.

In what might be a slight over-simplification, I value coherence and meaningfulness. 

I am learning to apologize less for having an abundance of interests, and what might be described as a sense of impatience.

I have an email newsletter (a few, actually) that I have not yet figured out a good cadence for emailing/communicating with.

_Here's a teaser of the kinds of things we will discuss in the newsletter:_

Compare these two drawings about Charleston, SC:


![subsidized and ugly](/images_2020/subsidized.jpeg)

![illegal but beautiful](/images_2020/illegal.jpg)

Why might one of these be subsidized, and why might one be illegal? What are the first-order and second-order effects of such things?

Which would you like to be built across the street from you?

More critically, **what are the second-order effects of fixing what is broken about this subsidized/illegal dynamic?**

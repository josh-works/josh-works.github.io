# Welcome!

I'm Josh. I do a mix of things, mostly related to software development, rock climbing, and helping software developers and rock climbers be better at what they do. 

My wife and I are based in Golden, CO. 

# What I'm working on right now 🕐

Two things:

## Current Project \#1 `IntermediateRuby`

I'm working on helping early-career Ruby/Rails software developers more quickly grow their skills. 

I'm doing this here:

I'm almost done with my first 5-part (😱) series. I paid a very kind and super-senior Rails Dev (👋 [Matt Swanson](https://twitter.com/_swanson/status/1258868684921147395)) to pair with me through an OSS bug fix. I recorded the whole session, and am breaking it up into short lessons with _very_ detailed accompanying notes. 

I'm not done yet, but already I'm _really_ pleased with how it's turning out.

## Current Project \#2 `Upgrade Your Aging Parent's Junky Old Laptop to a Chromebook: A Guide For Technical People`

_Here's the origin story:_

I spent a few hours recently helping my 75-year-old mother-in-law reconnect her junky old Windows laptop to the internet. Across five phone calls, and many pictures of her computer screen, we got her internet working again. 

As I did this, I live-tweeted the experience. It was about 20 tweets. A few pictures my mother-in-law sent me, and a poll.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My mother in law is frustrated that her internet wasn&#39;t working today. It&#39;s been broken all day. I&#39;ve called her a few times between other events to try to help debug it. <br><br>This is a screenshot I just received (via email) that she took *with her phone* <a href="https://t.co/5KnfCGZ2F4">pic.twitter.com/5KnfCGZ2F4</a></p>&mdash; Josh Thompson (@josh_works) <a href="https://twitter.com/josh_works/status/1290420667444338688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

This has been a painful process for both of us. I'm my family's "tech person", and I'm going to document the process by which I upgrade my mother-in-law's old Windows-something-or-another to a Chromebook. 

I learn and work in public. If my situation is at all similar to your situation, please follow the link and punch in your email, or hit one of the pre-purchase buttons!

## Other Things I've Written

I've written north of [240 blog posts]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/blog.md %}), which is too much for even _me_ to keep track of. 

Here's some possible places to start:

I like the Turing School of Software and Design. It's how I got my start in software. I work extensively with future/current Turing students, and many alumn on job-hunting, salary negotiation, job success-type topics.

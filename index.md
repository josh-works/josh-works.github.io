Hi there, I'm Josh. 




# Projects 

I'm either working on shipping some of the following projects, or have recently shipped these projects:

1. I am building [intermediateruby.com](https://intermediateruby.com/). It's a work-in-progress, lots to come
1. [A technically-inclined millenial's guide to managing their aging parent's laptop](https://josh.works/upgrade-parents-junky-old-laptop-to-chromebook)
1. Legalizing an authentic and beautiful style of building buildings in Golden, CO. 

Item 3 is far and away the most impactful and potentially valuable project I've ever worked on. I've _mostly_ stopped writing new blog posts, and most of my writing is focused on item \#3, and that now goes into this newsletter, which is a bit of an experiment. I'd _love_ for you to sign up and share feedback with me as you go:

{% include newsletter.html %}

Here's a teaser of what I'm working on. Compare these two images:

![subsidized and ugly - fully crop](/images_2020/subsidized-cropped.jpg)

![illegal but beautiful](/images_2020/illegal.jpg)

Now, if you lived across from an empty parking lot that was going to get redeveloped soon, which of these things would you prefer to see go up?

Most people say the second one. Currently, in Golden, CO, something like this could _never_ be built, because it's illegal, for a few different reasons, like:

1. Mandatory parking minimum laws
1. Minimum set-back laws
1. Prohibitions on mixing residential and commercial uses

I'd like to fix all three of these problems, and I'd like your help along the way. Drop your email address in here:

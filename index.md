# Welcome!

I'm Josh. I do a mix of things, mostly related to software development, rock climbing, and helping software developers and rock climbers be better at what they do. 

My wife and I are based in Golden, CO, but both work remotely and spend a fair bit of time traveling. 


Get in touch via [twitter](https://twitter.com/josh_works) or [email](mailto:thompsonjoshd@gmail.com).

# Currently Working On

I'm working on resources to help early-career software developers more quickly feel confident and competent in their skills. 

I've got about 2.5 years of professional software dev experience under my belt, which means I'm experienced enough that I can see the ideal end goal, in terms of skills and knowledge, but I'm new enough that I remember what it was like to be fumbling around, trying to get the most basic things to work.

My basic goal is "time compression". I'll spend 30 hours learning about something, and create a good enough set of exercises and resources that _you_ can take an hour here and there, for a total of about four hours, and learn most of what I learned about the same topic. 

So far, I'll be focusing on Ruby/Rails specific topics. 

It's pretty low key, you'll get about 1 email a week, straight from my keyboard to your inbox.

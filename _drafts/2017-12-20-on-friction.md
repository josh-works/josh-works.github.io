We're rapidly approaching the end of the year, and I've got a dozen things rolling around my head that I want to solidify my thoughts on.

One of the reasons I write things is to simply clarify my own thinking on a given topic.

This is known as [rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) and I've found it to be _enormously_ effective.

I've found myself to be often giving the advice of "write more" to people. One of my favorite past-times is helping people get new/better jobs, and a common thread throughout that process is "write something" or "write more". But in the same breath as I recommend writing as a means to a better job, I underscore that writing has endless value beyond the fairly transactional purpose of demonstrating competence.

This act (of pen to paper/fingers to keyboard) clarifies your thinking. On anything.

I've been resisting writing recently because much of my attention is unwillingly drawn to things that frustrate me. (Please reference: politics, marketing). The internet certainly doesn't need another screed about the injustices of {unjust thing}, and I don't plan to add another one.

I blame [Robert Heaton](https://robertheaton.com/2018/10/22/slash-office-hours/) for this. 

I really enjoy working with Turing students, as they get up to speed on Ruby and Rails.

I've [written a lot]() about working through Turing's collection of Ruby exercises. 

I touch on [job things]() here and there, and of course am an advocate of [remote work](), with some caveats. 

But sometimes it's useful to just chat through things! So, I'm modeling this page after Robert Heaton's `/office-hours` page: https://robertheaton.com/2018/07/17/office-hours/

Send me an email at thompsonjoshd@gmail.com with a few sentences on who you are and what you'd like to work on. Iâ€™ll email you right back with whether I think I can help, and we can get scheduling.

## What do I get out of this?

## Who am I?

## Recording videos

### Try to record a laptop screen, not a desktop screen

This is all wasted space:

Next time, I'll ask the expert to try to work off a laptop screen. Not sure if this will be the right call, because of the constraint, but it _might_ be the right call.

## Editing videos

For the [jekyll slugify bug fix series](https://intermediateruby.com/make-oss-contributions-part-0-introduction) I recorded 2 hours of video, ended up chopping it into 4 pieces.

Some viewers said that it being in four pieces was less ideal than it being in one long video, but I don't buy it; 2 hours of video is huge. I want for myself a sense of progress when learning things, so breaking this into four pieces gives some natural points to feel progress.

I did at least four passes on each chunk of the video.

### 1. Rough first pass to remind myself what Matt and I talked about, add a few comments, cut out the easy-to-identify low-value bits of the video

I'd always remove: 
- Long periods of silence (anything longer than 5 seconds)
- Conversation between Matt and I not germane to the topic at hand (like when we talk about 'maybe next time we'll do x')

### 2. 2nd pass, add detailed comments

On the second pass, I know where the video starts/stops, about what it covers, so I can add comments that are much more focused.

[add timestamp]

For example, in the above, I add a comment saying 

> in a few moments, X will happen

or

> we just made a mistake, did you see it?

This couldn't be done on the first pass, of course, because I don't have knowledge of what's coming in the future. 

As I do the 2nd pass, I'll also start jotting down more detailed notes.

If something happens in the video that requires a more detailed analysis, I'll provide at least the bones of it now.

### 3. 3rd pass, watching the finished video

Sometimes the video is ready to go after the 2nd pass. On this series, I've felt that it's taken me forever to edit the videos, but I think I could do it in three passes. Some I've done a lot more, but the value-add of additional passes is low.

It's because I'm nervous to release this, so I want it to be perfect, but I have no idea what is required to make it "perfect", so... 

I export the video from iMovie, upload it to youtube.

I then watch the exported video in VLC player, and add detailed timestamp notes.

I try to make sure that something of note happens every minute or two.

Youtube added a really nice feature recently that projects the listed timestamps into video "chapters" or something.

Here's the timestamps from the video description:

And here's how it ends up looking in youtube:

### Pause-and-write

Don't do text overlays on the videos; instead pause the video, insert the comment with a few seconds of silence, and continue.

My first video was all text overlays while the recording continued. I got lots of feedback that this was confusing.

Now I pause the video, insert the comment, and carry onward.

## Writing the notes

### Organize the series _and_ each post

Try to keep "the map" easy to find at all times. 

I have a series index AND table of contents on every post, so someone can see how the piece fits into the whole:

I'm not sure that this is critical, but

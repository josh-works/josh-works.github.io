It's that time of the year. I always really enjoy reading other people's annual reviews, and I find value in writing my own. 

_Previews reviews: [2018]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-05-05-2018_review.md %}), [2017]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2018-01-01-2017_review.md %}), 
[2016]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-01-11-2016-biggest-lesson-most-dangerous-books.md %}), [2015]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2016-01-23-2015-the-year-i-didnt-think-much.md %} )_

My review breaks down into a few broad categories:

- Travel
- Relationships & Community
- Leadville Trail Marathon
- Climbing
- Software Development
- Reading
- Projects


## Travel

Last year, Kristi and I said we wanted to travel "less" in 2019 than we did in 2018. I spent 113 nights away from Golden in 2019, or, in total, three months and three weeks. About 25% of that time was on climbing trips, the rest of it was travel for time with family and friends, or "regular" non-climbing travel, or work travel. 

It's the height of privilege and opportunity to travel this much, and it was about 25% less than we travelled last year. I will _still_ travel less in 2020, and I'd like a much higher percentage of that travel to be climbing trips. 

I'm writing this in an airport. Maybe next year I'll be doing it at home?

## Relationships & Community

Kristi, marriage counseling, elevating her, supporting her?

As you might imagine, I care deeply for my wife. She and I know that anything that contributes to our individual flourishing contributes to the health of our relationship, and a healthy relationship likewise contributes to individual flourishing. 

We still love marriage counseling, and individual counseling. I mention this counseling regularly in conversation with others, with a goal of normalizing _seeking professional help for important things_. If you agree that a professional of any domain would be well-off seeking improvement in their craft, even to the point of getting 1:1 coaching, you should agree that pursuing marriage counseling, regularly, is healthy.

## Leadville Trail Marathon

From late 2018 through mid-2019, I trained for the Leadville Trail Marathon. It's supposedly one of the harder marathons out there, because it's at such high elevation. It starts at 10,000+ feet and gets as high as 13,000+ ft. 

How one does on a race like a marathon is largely reflective of how well one prepared for it. I didn't have audacious goals in running it. My goal was no higher than:

> Don't embarrass myself

[Sam Landfried]() was my eternally encouraging and kind running partner. We ran many of our weekly long runs together, and quite a few of the short mid-week runs. 

I would not have completed the training and the race without him. 

More than a few Saturdays began with a drive into the mountains to run 15-20 miles, at elevation. Sometimes we were on the road, sometimes we were post-holing through thigh-deep snow. On the race day itself, there were a few times that he could easily have left me in the dust and run ahead (and consequently achieved a faster time) but he kindly stuck with me. 

We finished right at the 50th percentile for all finishers of the 2019 Leadville Trail Marathon. My goal was to finish above the bottom 25%, so this was a success. 

I'm thankful I had the opportunity to train and run.
 
## Climbing

The _downside_ of training for and running a marathon is that time spent training has to come from something. For me, the time came from climbing. 

My training in the spring and early summer nose-dived.

A few 5.12d's in a day, but missed the mark the rest of the time.



## Software Development

Two talks 


## Reading

~80 books. Annual book review coming later. 


## Miscellaneous 

- Taught a six-week Bible study on the book of Titus


## Things I'm thinking about for 2020

- course for leading confidently 
- best-in-breed exercises for making small gains as an early-career developer

# What _is_ Open Source Contribution?

Open Source Software (OSS) makes the world go around.

Everything software developers do every day has at least a few dependencies on open source software.

Rails, all its gems, Node modules, Ruby and JavaScript, etc all rely on OSS.

Open Source is, as far as I can tell, miserable for the project maintainers. Everyone has opinions, and no one has money, so... they get lots of requests and demands on their efforts, but no actual reward. (I've not heard of anyone paying rent in "internet points").

So, as a Turing student who's benefitted endlessly from OSS, we have a chance to give back.

It's been intimidating wading into the world of OSS contributions, because I've never done it before.

It feels like there's a few huge hurdles to overcome, and at some point, someone's gonna say

> Hold on, this Josh guy... he doesn't know what he's doing.

The good news is - this is an easily managed potential outcome:

1. Make it look like I know what I'm doing
2. Be up front with my limited knowledge

If, at that point, someone chooses to tease or criticize ... well, it's the internet. That's what happens.

# Contributions

I _love_ [Exercisms](). I've done much of the Ruby track, and am moving along (slowly) through the JavaScript track. Few things have been as effective for me as building general comfort in small, bite-sized problems in a given language, with tests to help guide me along.

So, I wanted to contribute to the Exercism project.

I [scanned through the list of open issues]() and found a few that were labeled "beginner friendly".

One of them was just writing documentation.

## Is "adding documentation" real contribution?

My first instinct on a docs-only OSS contribution was

> This is just low-hanging fruit, it's not actually _that_ useful, but it's something that's easy enough I can quickly do it

Turns out that's a na√Øve assumption, for two reasons:

1. Documentation is the first step of any developer using any tool.
2. Incomplete or insufficiently detailed documentation can make your tool unusable
3. Good documentation encourages more contributions

Go look at any popular gem or node module. The first thing you do? You scroll or ctrl-f your way through the README, to see if it'll do what you need it to do, and seems easy to use.

If it looks like it'll work, great!

If you can't figure out how to use it in your project, not great. You won't use it. You'll roll your own, or find a different tool.

Lets imagine you've got a few minutes and want to contribute to OSS, because you're reading all this stuff about "giving back to the community" and "oss maintainers need friends".

If you can't figure out how to contribute (or IF contributions are welcome) you're not going to contribute to that project.

All these reasons are why documentation contributions are important.

## Actual code contributions

Ah, the fun stuff. We're not writing docs anymore, we're making real contributions and fixes.

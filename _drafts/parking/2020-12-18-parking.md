Here's a collection of parking-related resources, specific to Golden, Colorado.

I want to highlight three primary barriers to pleasant urban form:

Compare these two images:

What's true in Charleston, South Carolina is true in Golden, Colorado. 

> Josh, why is this "local and authentic" building style _illegal_?

Great question! It's a bit of a winding story, which is why it takes a series of emails to unpack.

There are three primary reasons the currently-illegal style of building is illegal:

1. Laws regarding mandatory parking minimums
1. Laws regarding building setbacks
1. Laws regarding minimum plot size

Over time, across a series of articles, I'll explain two things:

1. Why locally-built, authentic Golden architecture + authentic Golden urbanism is currently illegal. It's a complicated story, but once you can see the whole thing, it's easy to imagine potential solutions that _cost nothing_.
2. Why industrialized, internationalist architecture + car-centric urbanism is subsidized by the government, the incredible costs (financial and otherwise) associated with the subsidy, and what to do about it.

Finally, you have a role to play in this. Even if your "role" is to silently read these posts, you've got a role to play. 

If you live in Golden, hope to someday live in Golden, and/or you care deeply about Golden, you have a huge potential role to play.

## The Fix For Parking Problems

I'm going to explore these two books:

![Shoup and Bertraud](/_drafts/parking/images/shoup-and-bertaud.jpg)

Here's the summary of [The High Cost of Free Parking](https://www.amazon.com/High-Cost-Free-Parking-Updated/dp/193236496X), by Donald Shoup.

> Donald Shoup is Distinguished Research Professor in the Department of Urban Planning at the University of California, Los Angeles. His research has focused on how parking policies affect cities, the economy, and the environment. 
> 
> In _The High Cost of Free Parking_, published in 2005 and updated in 2011, Shoup recommends that cities should:
>
> 1. Charge fair market prices for on-street parking
> 2. Spend the revenue to benefit the metered neighborhoods
> 3. Remove off-street parking requirements. 

It's hard to over-state the impact of these changes. I'll outline them soon.

## Why you should care about parking in your city

This issue is important and relevant to you, _especially if you think it's not important_. 

- Even if you've never visited the state of Colorado this is important to you.
- If you or anyone you care about is affected by Denver and Golden's extremely high cost of housing this is important to you. 
- If you own your residence this is important to you.
- If you rent your residence this is important to you.
- If you live in Golden this is important to you.

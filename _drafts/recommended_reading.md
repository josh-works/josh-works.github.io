_this is a draft **page** that will be permanent, updated occasionally_

I like to read, and I've found myself often making book recommendations to others.

I figure if I can recommend a book in person a bunch of times, I might as well assemble a list of books, short blurbs about why they're worth reading, and leave it for others to benefit from.

These are all books that have shaped me, grouped into several broad categories.

I mention some books "pair well" with other books, just as certain wines pair well with a certain foods. The ideas contained within certain books may compliment (or contrast) the ideas listed in the "pairs with" book.


I try to avoid reading any book written in the last five years. I don't always hold this rule, and sometimes break it, but on the whole, I avoid reading recently-written books. Older books have stood the test of some time. New books have not yet.

The following books are grouped by:

- [Thinking Well](#thinking-well)
- [Politics](#politics)
- [Buildings and Urbanism](#buildings-and-urbanism)
- [Theology](#theology)
- [Parenting](#parenting)
- [Relationships](#relationships-and-emotions)
- [Money](#money)
- [Uncomfortable books](#uncomfortable-books)
<!--more-->

# Thinking Well

As humans, we do a lot of thinking. And, when we're not thinking, we're living off of habit, and should think a bit about our habits. We underestimate large risks (driving) and over-estimate small risks (terrorism, kidnapping).

### [Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17340611-antifragile)

Most biological systems benefit from stress in the environment. (Muscles. Exercise them, they get stronger). Many man-built institutions generally hate risk and do all they can to avoid exposure to risk. They are successful, for a time, until they catastrophically fail. You can build your life on the principles of a biological system, or on the principles of a rigid institution.

_Antifragile_ is an annoying book. The author is a pompous, arrogant man. Unfortunately, he's also _correct_.

This book, coupled with _Seeing like a State_ and _Money, Bank Credit, and Economic Cycles_ has completely destroyed any confidence I've had in the professional thinking class. (Academics, politicians, and others with no "skin in the game"). If you would like to maintain your confidence in these people and institutions, please don't read these books.

### [The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/242472.The_Black_Swan)

This book is written by the same author of _Antifragile_, and he talks about life in "mediocrastan" vs "extremistan", and all the implications of misjudging which world you live in. This book and _Antifragile_ have absolutely shaped many ways in which I live my life.

### [A Mind for Numbers: How to Excel at Math and Science (Even If You Flunked Algebra)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693655-a-mind-for-numbers)

The "Right brain vs left brain" model is wrong. If you want to learn a technical topic, you can. Just like how if you wanted to cut a piece of wood, you can. If you have the right tool. A butter knife will not cut a piece of wood very well, but a buzz saw might.

_A Mind for Numbers_ gives you that buzz saw. With the right tactics and motives, anyone can read anything. I read this before jumping into software development full-time, and this book delivered great value in that endeavor.


### [Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work)

_Deep Work_ is profound. It was [the best book I read in 2016]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2016-10-24-i-quit.md %}), and is no small part of the reason I went to Turing and got into software development.

From the author:

> Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It’s a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time. Deep work will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship. In short, deep work is like a super power in our increasingly competitive twenty-first century economy. And yet, most people have lost the ability to go deep—spending their days instead in a frantic blur of e-mail and social media, not even realizing there’s a better way.


Pursuing the skill of "deep work" will have a compounding effect on the rest of your life. A little investment now makes the rest of your efforts just a little more effective, and leaves you with more room to get better at deep work, which in turn makes your efforts more effective, and on and on.



# Politics

I'm a fan of the idea of shrinking the political sphere. Politics is where everyone has a rightful sense of ownership of the issue (we all pay taxes, after all) and where the outcomes can be influenced _literally by who yells the loudest_. It's embarrassing that the way we organize ourselves relies entirely upon coercion, but for now, that's what it is. I look forward to when our dominant political institutions go the way of the church at the end of the medieval ages.

A theme through the next few book recommendations is [unintended consequences](https://www.fs.blog/2018/02/unintended-consequences/) and [second order effects](https://www.fs.blog/2016/04/second-level-thinking/).


### [Seeing Like a State](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20186.Seeing_Like_a_State)

The craft of statehood is hard, and the state has been remarkably consistent at sustaining itself, despite myriad harms heaped upon its citizens.

I'm quoting at length from [Slate Star Codex's excellent review of the book](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/):

> [The author] starts with the story of “scientific forestry” in 18th century Prussia. Enlightenment rationalists noticed that peasants were just cutting down whatever trees happened to grow in the forests, like a chump. They came up with a better idea: clear all the forests and replace them by planting identical copies of Norway spruce (the highest-lumber-yield-per-unit-time tree) in an evenly-spaced rectangular grid. Then you could just walk in with an axe one day and chop down like a zillion trees an hour and have more timber than you could possibly ever want.
>
> This went poorly. The impoverished ecosystem couldn’t support the game animals and medicinal herbs that sustained the surrounding peasant villages, and they suffered an economic collapse. The endless rows of identical trees were a perfect breeding ground for plant diseases and forest fires. And the complex ecological processes that sustained the soil stopped working, so after a generation the Norway spruces grew stunted and malnourished. Yet for some reason, everyone involved got promoted, and “scientific forestry” spread across Europe and the world.
>
> And this pattern repeats with suspicious regularity across history, not just in biological systems but also in social ones.


### [Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25852784-evicted)

This is a brutal read. So much is stacked against our poor - they might identify less as "in need of help" and more as "please stop actively ruining our lives". Non-intervention would often be preferred to "assistance".

### [The Color of Law](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32191706-the-color-of-law)

The modern US implementation of zoning is a by-product of the Supreme Court making [redlining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining) illegal. Since explicit racism was no longer legal, racist people implemented laws that were not explicitly racist, but everyone understood it to be laws to keep black (and and poor) people out of their neighborhoods.

I'll state that again - your neighborhoods HOA, your single-family-home neighborhood, your mortgage interest tax-deduction - all this was put in place by racists, to further their vision of a segregated society.

Of course, these policies are harmful to minorities and poor people, _but they are also harmful to everyone else, including those who ostensibly benefit from the policies_. The US is collectively shooting itself in the foot, every day, by allowing these policies to stand.

_The Color of Law_ pairs well with [Negroes and the Gun](#negroes-and-the-gun-the-black-tradition-of-arms).

### [Money, Bank Credit, and Economic Cycles](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54388.Money_Bank_Credit_and_Economic_Cycles)

I've read this book twice, but it is a dense read, and longer than 1000 pages. You could read the first 10% of the book, and be more educated than 99% of pundits blabbering away on TV.

The author lays out a few bold claims, and backs them up:

- There was a time when the treatment of bank _deposits_ and bank _investments_ were very different.
- A bank making use of its customers deposits, for its own interests, was once considered simple fraud, illegal, and a banker who engaged in such fraud and was unable to make its customers whole was beheaded. (Today we call this "fractional reserve banking")
- Fractional-reserve banking is a legal fiction, and is actually fraud.
- Economic cycles ("booms" followed by "busts", or "corrections") are assumed to be the normal state of affairs right now, but they need not exist.
- Most of the money churning around the global economy doesn't _really_ exist, and once a very small people lose confidence in it, much of it will evaporate.

This book is a fascinating read, but dense. I wish I could recommend a smaller book that gave adequate treatment to this topic, but I have not found it yet. Just read the first 10% of the book and call it a day.

### [The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11324722-the-righteous-mind)

You know all those people who don't agree with you?

They're not evil people who hate babies and puppies and want everyone to live in squalor. They most likely want almost the exact same things you do. (Safety, security, to live in peace with their family in a community of people who doesn't hate them, etc.)

_The Righteous Mind_ will (hopefully) give you a little compassion for those standing on the other side of a given topic. It pairs well with [Getting to Yes: Negotiating an Agreement Without Giving In](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/313605.Getting_to_Yes).

If you find yourself resisting reading such a book, knowing that it might de-stigmatize "the other", I humbly propose that _you_ have the problem.

# Buildings and Urbanism

To me, traditional architecture is irrelevant. Architects build buildings for other architects, not for people.

What _is_ relevant is the buildings and environment in which we all live. We (humans) shape the environment in which we live, and we are shaped by the environment in which we live.

It stands to reason that an environment more conducive to use, at a lower price point, that encourages human flourishing is superior to one that is less conducive to use, costs more, and squelches human flourishing.

### [How Buildings Learn](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38310.How_Buildings_Learn)

This book has beautiful and fascinating photography throughout, often capturing buildings that have lasted for hundreds of years. Buildings, if allowed, change dramatically over time.

A theme throughout the book is that we should _expect_ buildings to change, and _plan_ for them to change.

I'm quoting a [GoodReads reviewer](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/44813468?book_show_action=true&from_review_page=1):

> You will love this book if, like me, you think that modern and postmodern architecture has gone terribly, terribly wrong. (Conversely, if you worship Frank Gehry, I. M. Pei, and their ilk, you will probably be offended.) Stewart Brand argues convincingly that the buildings that survive are those that can be flexible enough to adapt to the changing needs and tastes successive generations of inhabitants. He is particularly trenchant in his criticism of the overprogrammed, over-designed, sculptural architectural buildings (he calls them "magazine architecture") that are often obsolete before they are completed, and he points out that, Frank Lloyd Wright's opinion notwithstanding, it is not in fact a sign of architectural success if the roof leaks!
>
> Also be sure to check out his very original comments on "low-road" buildings, those whose designs are so throwaway that successive inhabitants can and do feel utterly free to knock down walls, cut through floors, and otherwise jerry-rig them to adapt to current needs. It's a brilliant exploration of an often neglected but probably ubiquitous subset of buildings.

### [The Death and Life of Great American Cities](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30833.The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities)

Jane Jacobs _loves_ cities. She loves the unplanned, chaotic, messy way that cities evolve. She might well make you love the same thing.

She hits hard in this book, and her words are even more relevant today than they were in the 1950s.

Quoting from [this excellent review on GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/747832578?book_show_action=true&from_review_page=1):

> Jacobs’s recipe for creating a healthy neighborhood has four ingredients:
>
> - (1) mixed uses, so that different kinds of people are drawn to the area at different times of day for different reasons;
> - (2) a mixture of old and new buildings, so that there is low-rent space available for small businesses and low-income residents;
> - (3) small blocks, so that streets are not isolated from one another; and
> - (4) sufficient density of residents, to create the necessary amount of economic and social activity.
>
> The goal is to produce a neighborhood like her own Greenwich Village: with lots of street life, with successful residents who choose to stay long-term, with local stores and restaurants and cafes, and with a steady influx of immigrants.

This book discusses the tension between "chaos" and "order" in a way that pairs very well with _Seeing like a State_. It pairs well with _Antifragile_, as well, as Jacobs talks about small bets, organic growth, and the dangers of "cataclysmic money" and top-down growth and planning.

# Theology

Every person is a functional theologian. "Theology" is defined as:

> the study of the nature of God and religious belief.

Most of us don't intentionally engage in "studying theology" - this would be sidestepped by someone who says "I don't believe in god" or "maybe there is a God, maybe there isn't, but I don't think about it."

The good news is this is an example of _applied theology_. We are all practical theologians, because we all have a stance on the existence of God. Maybe it's apathy, maybe it's the flying spaghetti monster.

Everyone has opinions on "god". Indeed, to refuse to consider the existence of "god" is an applied theology.

I am one of those weird folk that have a very specific theology. Were I to have to define my theology, I'd just throw my lot in with [the Westminster Shorter Catechism](http://matt2819.com/wsc/).

If you've not encountered such a thing before, take a gander at [5 reasons you need the Westminster shorter catechism](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/five-reasons-you-need-the-westminster-shorter-catechism/).

Its easy to get into the weeds on the finer points of theology. I argue its mostly irrelevant unless it impacts how you live your life.

A personal relationship with Jesus Christ is the most profound relationship you'll ever have. It's also a big ask, that he might actually exist.

### [The Reason for God](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1858013.The_Reason_for_God)

This is my go-to book for someone who's curious to know more about my crazy beliefs about the world. The author is a pastor of a church in New York City, and does a great job unpacking the core pieces of Christianity, from a range of perspectives, in a way that would lead you to agree that it is internally consistent.

By "internally consistent", I mean that if you are comfortable with a small number of starting assumptions, the implications of those assumptions are reasonable. One of those starting assumptions (indeed, the only important one) is:

_A few thousand years ago, a man named Jesus was born, said some things, was killed by the religious leaders of the day, and then didn't stay dead._

That assumption, right there, is _the foundation of the entire Christian religion._ If it happened, it's a really big deal. If it didn't happen, feel pity on us all, because we are wildly misguided and stupid.

If that happened, the things he said have great weight. If they didn't happen, its the ravings of a lunatic and should be forgotten posthaste.

I recommend the book. If you read it, shoot me an email. I'd love to hear about it.

### [When I Don't Desire God: How to Fight for Joy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45352.When_I_Don_t_Desire_God)

This (and the next few books) are written by and to those who agree with the basic tenants of the Christian religion.

This book was written as a follow-up to [Desiring God: Meditations of a Christian Hedonist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213367.Desiring_God).

I, and many others I've spoken about this with, often struggle to feel a sense of satisfaction, peace, and rest.

If you happen to care about what the Bible says, you'll quickly recall that there is _no_ satisfaction or peace apart from God. That won't stop us all from trying to find it in something (programming! Rock climbing! Travel!) but we'll come up short.

This book will point you in the right direction. It's served me well.

### [The Secret Thoughts of an Unlikely Convert: An English Professor's Journey Into Christian Faith](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14741290-the-secret-thoughts-of-an-unlikely-convert)

The author of this book chronicles her extremely reluctant encounter with Christianity, and the pain and wounding that came about therein.

From a [GoodReads review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/553341153?book_show_action=true&from_review_page=1):

> Honestly, I wasn't expecting much. From first couple of chapters, I saw the transformation of a former feminist/lesbian English professor to Christ-embracing, sinner who was now redeemed. The chapters unpacked the clashing world views for Butterfield and how a rejection of her old self and acceptance of Christ meant the utter destruction of her life pillars. From resigning her privileged position as a college professor to faithfully engaging the roles of a pastor's wife, Butterfield exemplified the radical nature of conversion. Throughout the book, it was clear that unlike the neatly fashioned conversion stories whispered into the mic's in the suburban youth ministries of today, a real conversion--one wrecked by an encounter with Christ--changed lives and those around them.

### [Extravagant Grace: God's Glory Displayed in Our Weakness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18184844-extravagant-grace)

If you were raised in "the church", chances are good you got really heavy doses of shame served to you much of your life. Shame has been my constant companion for as long as I can remember.

My ideal solution was always "fix myself, do everything perfectly, or change my rubric for myself so I'm living a functionally perfect life".

Spoiler: this doesn't work.

_Extravagant Grace_ is based on John Newton's writings, and I found it to be immensely valuable to me when I read it. There are fair claims that the book leans too far in the direction of "it's OK to wallow in your sin", but I respectfully disagree with those claims.

If you are prone to heap shame upon yourself or others, this might be of value to you.

### [12 ways your phone is changing you](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31804439-12-ways-your-phone-is-changing-you)

From a [GoodReads review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1978037057):

> [The author's] writing in this book is in top form. He weaves words like Batman weaves punches. What I loved most about this book is that it shows the problem and gives a biblical solution to it WITHOUT being legalistic. He evens calls out all the technology haters and shows them why they are wrong to hate God's good gifts just because people use them for evil.
>
> This book drips joy from the very first pages. John Piper's forward is great. Hearing the poll stats/metrics and what that means is heartbreaking. [The author's] sections on FOMO, vices, and loneliness are some of his best. But his chapter on harshness is a must read for everyone who engages on social media, especially for people who like to involve themselves in discernment or watchdog blogs, accounts, or sites.

# Parenting

I'm not a parent. I'm sure once I have kids I'll have a different set of books to recommend.

### [Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids: Why Being a Great Parent is Less Work and More Fun Than You Think](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10266902-selfish-reasons-to-have-more-kids)

This book gets the notable distinction of being why Kristi and I want to have kids in the near term. It had a profound and measurable impact on our plans and thinking. Enough said.

### [The Art of Roughhousing: Good Old-Fashioned Horseplay and Why Every Kid Needs It](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9861067-the-art-of-roughhousing)

Physical play is deeply satisfying. I rough-housed with friends all the time when growing up. This book does make a case for the myriad benefits children, their friends, and parents can experience with roughhousing, but it's mostly a manual for _how_ to roughhouse.

It's got a few dozen suggested (and illustrated) games that are appropriate for all ages, and all size differences.

>  The Art of Roughhousing shows how rough-and-tumble play can nurture close connections, solve behavior problems, boost confidence, and more. Drawing inspiration from gymnastics, martial arts, ballet, traditional sports, and even animal behavior, the authors present dozens of illustrated activities for children and parents to enjoy together-everything from the "Sumo Dead Lift" to the "Rogue Dumbo." These delightful games are fun, free, and contain many surprising health benefits for parents.

A surprisingly practical and immediately relevant read for anyone who has kids. I plan on re-reading it once I have a child of my own.

# Relationships and Emotions

### [What Did You Expect?: Redeeming the Realities of Marriage](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7350849-what-did-you-expect)

### [Boundaries: When to Say Yes, How to Say No to Take Control of Your Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/944267.Boundaries)

### [Difficult Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters Most](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/774088.Difficult_Conversations)

### [When Sinners Say "I Do": Discovering the Power of the Gospel for Marriage](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1451719.When_Sinners_Say_I_Do_)

### [Daring Greatly](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13588356-daring-greatly)

### [Search Inside Yourself: The Unexpected Path to Achieving Success, Happiness (And World Peace)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12921211-search-inside-yourself?from_search=true)

# Money

### [Your Money or Your Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/642360.Your_Money_Or_Your_Life)
### [I Will Teach You to be Rich](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11221769-i-will-teach-you-to-be-rich)


# Uncomfortable books

I include this section for books that hold uncomfortable ideas for broad sections of the population. If you find yourself in total agreement with the arguments in one of these books, great! Pick another book off of this list. It'll make you uncomfortable.

### [The Problem With Political Authority](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15794037-the-problem-of-political-authority)

This book (its technically a textbook written by a professor from Colorado University - Boulder) argues that "political" authority cannot be arrived at from first principles, and building institutions upon a foundation of one group legally exercising coercion against another might be legal (in the same way that slavery used to be "legal") but it's not moral.


### [The Origins of Proslavery Christianity: White and Black Evangelicals in Colonial and Antebellum Virginia](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2507760.The_Origins_of_Proslavery_Christianity)

When some religious authority in the US makes a pronouncement of how laws should be written, in order to sustain a moral community, I will always think of this book. There was a time when many christian thinkers expended great energy to justify the existence of slavery. So, when {topic of the day} mixed with {"political" solution to said problem} involves steamrolling over some marginalized group... I'll just think back to the sections in this book outlining the theological justifications religious leaders used for slavery.

### [The Privatization of Roads and Highways](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12720771-the-privatization-of-roads-and-highways)

That which we've grown up with, we (humans) tend to assume is not just ideal, but _morally correct_. We've grown up (as a nation) with government-built roads. It's so impossible to imagine something else that as soon as someone suggests some crazy idea, a standard retort is "but who would build the roads?" followed by "if you like anarchy, move to somalia!".

This book addresses the first portion of that objection.

_spoiler: for most of the time that humans have been building roads, they've been funded and built privately. Public road building has catastrophic implications for everyone._

### [Negroes and the Gun: The Black Tradition of Arms](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17834926-negroes-and-the-gun)

I'm skeptical of regimes where the government is charged with protecting some minority group. My reason for this is three-fold:

- Governments are an expression of the people in them, who are a sub-section of the population as a whole. _The government tends to have the opinions of the majority of the people_
- If "the people" are racist, the government will be racist, _and will use its power to further racist goals_.
- If some of the people are not racist, and try to change the government's policies to be less racist, _they will not be successful until enough of the population is no longer racist that the government will, by default, be less racist._
- The government's "progressive" policies tend to lag the policies of the general population.

This book outlines, among other things, how a strong federal, state, and local government used its power to inflict incredible harm on black people. Much of this harm was inflicted after the "legal" elimination of formal slavery and the Jim Crowe laws.


### [A Paradise Built in Hell: The Extraordinary Communities That Arise in Disaster](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19271055-a-paradise-built-in-hell)

We're told that when society breaks down, we devolve into a state of anarchy and will kill each other, or be killed by each other. This happens to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. It turns out that when disaster strikes, things tend to work out pretty well.

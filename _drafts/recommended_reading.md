_this is a draft **page** that will be permanent, updated occasionally_

I like to read, and I've found myself often making book recommendations to others.

I figure if I can recommend a book in person a bunch of times, I might as well assemble a list of books, short blurbs about why they're worth reading, and leave it for others to benefit from.

These are all books that have shaped me, grouped into several broad categories.

I mention some books "pair well" with other books, just as a certain wine pairs well with a certain meat. The ideas contained within certain books may compliment (or contrast) the ideas listed in the counterparty book. I find most book recommendation "engines" to be too simplistic - they assume that if I liked a given book, I might like other books like it.

This is simplistic, because I like books that build atop of each other, not just are similar to each other.

Finally, I try to avoid reading any book written in the last five years. I don't always hold this rule, and sometimes break it, but on the whole, avoid reading recently-written books. Older books have stood the test of some time. New books have not yet.

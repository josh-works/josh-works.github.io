_this is a draft **page** that will be permanent, updated occasionally_

I like to read, and I've found myself often making book recommendations to others.

I figure if I can recommend a book in person a bunch of times, I might as well assemble a list of books, short blurbs about why they're worth reading, and leave it for others to benefit from.

I don't consider myself to be widely read, but I'll try just about anything once.

_Describe why you are writing the post you are about to write_

I write a lot. 

Since I work remotely, nearly all of my communication with my team is via text, in some form of another. 

- Slack messages
- Jira tickets
- Code (duh)
- Pull requests (my own PRs, or comments in someone else's)
- Github gists, for long-form content.
- Blog posts (like the one you're reading!)

It's these last two that I'm talking about today. 

I don't know how many words I write in a day, but it's many. I've got _many_ gists floating around:

![so many gists](/images/2019-01-14_gists_count.jpg)

I write when I get stuck on thorny questions. [I have written before about how important it is to ask good questions]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-06-04-learning-how-to-learn.md %}), and usually put together a gist with notes, code snippets, expected outcomes vs. actual outcomes, things I've tried, resources, etc. 

I write quick guides that I can refer back to later, when I work through tricky steps related to the work we at Wombat/Proofpoint. 

I've found myself recommending to others _all the time_ that they write technical blog posts. 

If you want to work remotely - start writing technical blog posts.

If you want a job - start writing technical blog posts.

If you want to improve your learning and comprehension of a topic - write a technical blog post about it. 

Want to get better at programming? Start writing about it. 

I get tons of value from writing technical blog posts, but I find it daunting to get started. 

_state your goal, explicitly, for the post_

So, after I was harping _again_ on the value of writing technical blog posts, [Ruth Brand](https://medium.com/@ruthbrandsoprano) asked me 

> so how _do_ you write a technical blog post?

And I drew a big ol' blank, and now it seems like every time I've told someone to write a blog post, it's like telling them to draw an owl:

I'm going to walk you through how I write a technical blog post. I don't know exactly how I do, so I'm going to be writing a technical blog post _as I write this guide_, and hopefully will have a tolerable guide _and technical blog post_ at the end.  (I am working on "exploring gems for fun and profit" as the companion technical blog post.)

# Steps to write a technical blog post

## Describe why you are writing the post you are about to write

When I write a technical post, I usually do not have a defined end-goal in mind, at least when I start. So, embrace this, and tee up some context about why you're writing the post. 

In [Exploring Gems for Fun and Profit](), which I'm writing as I write this current post, all I know is 

> I want to be able to run some commands and explore the innards of the gems I have installed on my system. Hopefully I can figure out how to explore them at runtime.

So, I outlined that in the intro. 

## Explain your micro-goal, as if to a friend standing next to you, and then start exploring it. 

One of the first things I do when writing a gist, or putting together a technical blog post, is put a list of resources at the end of the post. That way, as I pull together links and guides and other notes from around the internet, I can just toss them in the list. 

Then, I pick the most promising resource so far, and start walking through it, "thinking aloud" as I go.

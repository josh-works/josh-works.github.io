I worked through the steps in [How to Control your Jira Notifications (Modus)](https://moduscreate.com/blog/how-to-control-your-jira-notifications/). It is life-changing.

My personal inbox is well-managed. It's often at zero emails, or close to it. 

I can use it as a to-do list; when there are emails in my inbox, there are steps I need to take with those emails.

But my work inbox is a trashfire. 

I have 20,000 emails in my trash because ErrBit is going crazy. 

58 of my 79 unread emails are Jira notifications. Most contain nothing of value, like "someone added an attachment to a random ticket that you looked at once". 

Worse, though, is there are a _few_ emails in my inbox that are _genuinely important_, and I'm loosing sight of them every day under the deluge of Jira notifications.

So, I googled around. I found [How to Control your Jira Notifications (Modus)](https://moduscreate.com/blog/how-to-control-your-jira-notifications/), which lead me to make two changes:

### Global "autowatch disabled"

<!--more-->


### Global "unwatch tickets", applied to all tickets I was watching.

Here I go, unwatching 257 issues:

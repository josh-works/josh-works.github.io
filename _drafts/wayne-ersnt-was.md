Kristi's dad passed away early this year: January 12, 2020. 

He was one of her best friends. She and he spoke on the phone _every day_. I'm not speaking hyperbolically - she and he spoke on the phone almost 365 times last year. He was a pillar in his community, in a way I didn't even realize anyone could be today. (I associate the phrase with civic leaders from the 50s.)

There's a lot of pieces to pick up.

title: Zoning Regulations
---

Here's a police officer explaining that the sherif's office uses the zoning code to harrass people. You'll have to scroll down to the text:

> They came again after that, department records show. Smith said there were more checks that weren’t recorded. Once, deputies handcuffed Smith’s husband and put him in the back of their squad car. After some time, they released him. They said they mistook him for his brother.
>
> Families who did not react so patiently could face life-changing consequences.
>
> After multiple visits and more than $2,500 in code enforcement citations, Tammy Heilman told a deputy asking about her son — one of the program’s targets — to call her attorney. Late for her 7-year-old daughter’s Girl Scout meeting, she drove away in a rush. The deputy yelled that they weren’t wearing seat belts. He followed her down the block, pulled her over and arrested her.

The video shows her arrest. It's traumatizing. 

> Heilman was charged with resisting arrest and battery on an officer. She also was charged with providing false information about her son. Deputies told her family that she was arrested for driving away with the seatbelt violation. On the ride to jail, a deputy said she was arrested because she didn’t stop to speak with him.

Now the cop explains that they fabricate zoning violations to harrass people:

Two days later, they arrest her again. 

> Heilman was released on bail. But two years later, while Heilman was fighting the charges in court, the deputies were back at her house.
> 
> They charged her with felony battery on a law enforcement officer for hitting the deputy with the screen door. Because she was on probation for the previous arrest, she was ineligible for bail. She stayed in jail for 76 days before finally agreeing to a plea deal so she could be home for Christmas.

530.21. Home Occupations

A. Purpose

The intent of this section is to provide for certain types of restricted home occupations. The purpose of this section is to establish performance standards that will provide fair and equitable administration and enforcement of this section. Only such uses will be allowed which:
1. Are incidental to the use of the premises as a residence;
2. Are compatible with residential uses in the area;
3. Are limited in scale and intensity; and
4. Do not detract from the residential character of the area.

If the application of the home occupation regulations conflict with other sections of this Code, the most restrictive shall apply.

Standards for All Home Occupations
1. The use of the dwelling unit for the home occupation shall be clearly incidental and secondary to its use for residential purposes.
2. There shall be no change in the outside appearance of the building or premises as a result of such business.
3. No exterior signs and no signs that would be visible from the street or neighboring dwellings that are associated with the home occupation are permitted. Professional signs that are statutorily required are permitted.
4. A home occupation shall be conducted wholly within the principal residential dwelling unit or in an accessory building on the parcel, except as otherwise noted herein.
5. No outside display, storage, or use of land is permitted for the home occupation.
6. More than one (1) home occupation may be permitted in a single residence; however, all applicable limitations herein shall apply to the combined uses as if they were one business.
7. No truck deliveries are permitted, except for parcels delivered by public or private services that customarily make residential deliveries.
8. For those home occupations that require a special exception, the approval of the special exception shall not be transferred to another owner or lessee of the property.

D. Minor Home Occupation Standards

1. A minor home occupation shall occupy no more than twenty-five (25) percent of the total floor area of the dwelling unit and nondwelling unit accessory building.
2. The use shall not create dangerous vapors or fumes, and no use shall be permitted where noise, light, glare, odor, dust, vibration, heat, or other nuisance extends beyond the subject dwelling unit or structure.

3. No mechanical equipment shall be used on the premises, except those normally used for purely domestic or household purposes.
4. New vehicle trip generation, except those as addressed in Section 530.21.D.5, shall not result from the establishment of a minor home occupation, i.e., the home occupation shall not involve appointments in the residence.
5. An applicant may seek a Special Exception from the Planning Commission that allows trip generation as a result of the establishment of a minor home occupation, but shall meet the following conditions:
  a. In no case, shall more than fourteen (14) total daily trips, including those associated with the primary residential use, be generated per dwelling unit as a result of the establishment of the home occupation(s).
  b. All business-related visits shall be by appointment only and shall be limited to one (1) customer at a given time. Where applicable, and where on-site parking is available, an additional person in waiting is permitted.
  c. Traditional home-based instruction, such as, but not limited to, tutoring and music or swimming lessons or the like, is permitted where instruction is provided by only one (1) instructor to no more than three (3) students per class.

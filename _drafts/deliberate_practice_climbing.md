I recently wrote about [deliberate practice and programming]( {{ site.baseurl }}{% link _drafts/deliberate_practice_climbing_programming.md %} ) I've also been wondering what lessons might be drawn from Deliberate Practice and applied to the _skill_ of rock climbing. 

The popular perception is that climbing is about strength

This is completely true. Strength matters. [Some people think otherwise](will's 'climbing is a skill sport' post), but I am still of the believe that strength (specifically, finger strength) is the most important factor that you can bring to the table when it comes to hard sport climbing and bouldering.

That said, _skill_ will dictate what you can do with your strength. 

At the moment, I believe that my _strength_ has outpaced my _skill_, and while I still am training to become _stronger_, I'm unable to effectively convert strength gains into the maximum climbing abilities. I may get 10% stronger, for example, but only be 3% better at rock climbing. 

If my "skills" were fully developed, if I got 10% stronger, I'd be 10% better at climbing. 

So, deliberate practice and rock climbing.

# How is deliberate practice applied in other domains

Golf

Tennis


- technique matters, yes, but also beta. I forget my bta.

how do other sports handle visualization? 

I want to apply the principles of deliberate practice to me improving my visualization and beta recall.

I've got plans. I may have recently sent you a detailed write-up of how I'd like us to work together.

It's a bit of a departure from the most common forms of employment. I'm trying to avoid full-time employment. I'm a software developer, but I really love to teach.

But as much as I like "software development", I'm way more interested in time with friends, rock climbing, working on projects around the house, riding my bike around Golden, hanging out with nieces and nephews and ðŸ¤žsoon _my own_ children.

I've got _huge_ projects I want to work on around Golden, and I'd like to get as many friends/family/etc to someday _move_ to Golden and help me.

## Recruiters

~redacted~ and ~redacted~, I'd love to eventually become a source of many reliable candidates. More candidates than you two (or all future growth of your respective practices) can place. 

If you have a "glut" of candidates, you can use that to sell into new companies (or get more placements at current companies.)

> Sure, Josh, you've made some interesting introductions, but why do I think you'll get me _future_ money?

Great question. The project I'm working on causes me to speak regularly with senior engineers (I'm not going to name-drop, to maintain the privacy of the engineers I work with, but these are the kinds of engineers that can send an email to five friends and get ten responses of `come join my team ASAP` in a day.)

I brought up ~redacted recruiter~ in a recent conversation, just because an engineer who's _extremely_ talented and experienced said:

> I'm discontent in my current role, and trying to find the right fit somewhere else.

For the right mix of opportunities, he'd be willing to work at the right company for under $150,000/yr. He also could take a FAANG role for $400,000/yr. 

So, I can confidently commit to a certain pipeline of future opportunity for you both, at a short-term (weeks/months) and long-term (years) perspective. 

$300-3000/mo right now 

## How I'll secure the medium/long-term pipeline (3 year)

Most of the work that I want to do, I will offer, for free, to anyone who wants to work through it.

As I can responsibly allocate resources to improving various guides, I'll do so.

I most want to spend time focusing on _intermediate_ software developers. The kinds of people that are within their first 1-3 years of work experience.

I want to double down on some of the high-quality guides I've made, but have not yet had a chance to allocate enough time to.

I've worked 1:1 with enough engineers to know that I can confidently level up their skills.

## Introduction 

A few times I've had the priviledge of stumbling into an idea, act, or articulation that, while firmly rooted in banal phenomina in one domain, feels quite novel when applied to a new domain.

'coning' a road, street, or junction is one of those banal-and-novel acts. I'll explain below, and I hope you might try something similar some day for yourself.

I am extremely aware of how dangerous roads and junctions are. Cars feel to me as dangerous as guns, and I'm accutely aware of when a car is pointed at me, same as I'd be aware of a gun being pointed at me. 

The driver of that car could kill me with the press of a foot with a car, just as the user of a gun could kill someone with the press of a finger. Check out my piece on bollards for more: [Bollards: What and Why]({{ site.baseurl  }}{% link _posts/2024-04-30-bollards.md %}).

I am unable to dissociate from shit roads and dangerous dynamics created by those road designers, and the people who use them. I've slightly unusual points of view, but I am aware of feeling something similar about roads my whole life. I am sensitive, sometimes extremely sensitive, and in ways that unavoidably inconvenience others. If you talk to some former partners, you could get long lists of ways my sensitivity and emotional delicacy has been experienced as extremely inconveniencing.

Cars are so loud, and one can infer so much about a vehicle and its driver from things like:

- relative ratios of accelerating, coasting, braking. (In a 100 second segment of driving, what is the ratio between accellerating, coasting, braking? How quickly does the driver cycle between the three, and how smoothly or sharply?)
- speed in many different ways - speed through curves, speed through turns


I got permission from the city engineer and mayor of Golden to try cone-based speed shaping experiments in Golden, and since then have replicated the treatment and results on many different intersections. Here's the chronology. I'm pleased to have video footage of almost every treatment I've ever done. 

## 1. South Denver, a pedestrian crossing of a residential road

- I lived on this street, could see the crossing being treated from the front yard of where I was staying

The cones remaind in place for weeks.

TODO: Add video footage

## 2. South Denver, noise reduction on an arterial going past cafes, breweries, lots of outdoor seating

This treatment was excellent, I'm pleased with the results, the noise level came down by so much, AND things were made way safer. 

TODO: Add video footage

The cones were taken away after a few hours

## 3. Centeral Denver, reducing noise, improving awareness

TODO: Add video footage of intersection I did w/Tejen

## 4. Loveland, pedestrian crossing of a four lane road with sometimes 50+mph traffic!!!

I later spent some time living adjacent to this intersection:

TODO: Add the many video clips I have of this intersection

## 5. Humboldt & 16th

TODO: Add video of this intersection

# General complaints about inadequate and dangerous and inefficient American intersections

Oh, I have beef with American intersections. I hate to use them, to even witness them, so I don't travel much by car, and when I do, it feels emotionally expensive. Feels like I'm walking on the graveyard of evidence of ethnic cleansing, and I cannot help but feel affected by the weight over the years of the death, bloodshed, misery, destroyed places and humans, that this whole regime represents.

Intersections in america are comically large.

## Misc

an early treatment in Denver, an intersection directly adjacent to an elderly person's home with lots of people walking, rolling, meandering across the street and each of them deserving to not die. 

TODO: Add that video footage

"Traffic Cones and Junction Fixes: A DIY Guide" ?

## Introduction 

Here's a new word, I am introducing to the lexicon:

**Coning**, verb

> to place traffic cones at specific points in a road or junction to shape how people travel through the intersection. Simplifies and smooths complexity, increases safety for everyone. Dramatically reduces the four types of vehicle emissions: engine exhaust, brake dust, tire rubber microplastics, and noise.



Any vehicle that is accellerating from a stop to, say, 15 miles per hour, is generating all of those emissions except brake dust, and when that vehicle has to stop again, it'll generate the brake dust as well.

The noise of a vehicle is not just it's engine - lots of noise comes from the rolling of tires over a surface, and the sound of displaced air is quite loud. Brakes also often-enough generate noise. 

Another unique form of engine noise pollution is that based on how the driver uses the engine, the driver can signal to everyone something about the driver's internal emotional state. _I resent this_.

Compare accellerating and stopping behavior to travelling smoothly through a 30 meter section of road, without using the brake or gas pedal. The engine would be operating at an idle, instead of under accelleration. no brake dust, and the tire rubber microplastic generation would be at a much lower level than those same microplastics would be generated if the car was being stopped by the brakes or accellerated by the engine. 

> This seems audacious josh, because my prior experience has me beliving {that you are wrong and bad for opposing something so sacrosanct in the world, and banal}

IDGAF/have you met me?

Consider a junction in Poynton, UK. 

Here's a link to the 8 minute mark of a youtube video about this ['shared space' road junction](https://youtu.be/-vzDDMzq7d0?si=cgjINhEinykfajPD&t=483).

I wrote a bit more about Poynton on substack: [Interlude: A Pattern of Repair](https://zoningverydifferentthanours.substack.com/p/interlude-a-pattern-of-repair-episode), and then again, applying the concept to an intersection that I (unfortunately) must interact with regularly: [A Pattern of Repair: The 'traffic bean'](https://zoningverydifferentthanours.substack.com/p/a-pattern-of-repair-the-traffic-bean)

'coning' an intersection would be less intensive a treatment than a traffic bean, yet both obviously move with the same sorts of energies.

A few times I've had the priviledge of stumbling into an idea, act, or articulation that, while firmly rooted in banal phenomina in one domain, feels quite novel when applied to a new domain. This thing I'm discussing in this post is one of those novel things.

'coning' a road, street, or junction is one of those banal-and-novel acts. 

I'll explain below, and I hope you might try something similar some day for yourself.

Here's one of the very first traffic cones I set out, in my whole life, with the goal of creating/providing safety in mind:

_Some of the videos still live on tiktok, I've not done the 'download from TT/upload to wistia/embed here' thing. Sorry:_

https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7250134620694482218?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7461864056828823070



Here's the lightest-weight intervention I've ever did, that worked shockingly well:

https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7249134328502947118

That idea gave birth to the second iteration, sorta on the same walking path two blocks down:

<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/player.js" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/lqt60rz6m1.js" async type="module"></script><style>wistia-player[media-id='lqt60rz6m1']:not(:defined) { background: center / contain no-repeat url('https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/lqt60rz6m1/swatch'); display: block; filter: blur(5px); padding-top:177.78%; }</style> <wistia-player media-id="lqt60rz6m1" aspect="0.5625"></wistia-player>

Another intersection, later in time:

<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/player.js" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/kuqbgipm8a.js" async type="module"></script><style>wistia-player[media-id='kuqbgipm8a']:not(:defined) { background: center / contain no-repeat url('https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/kuqbgipm8a/swatch'); display: block; filter: blur(5px); padding-top:177.78%; }</style> <wistia-player media-id="kuqbgipm8a" aspect="0.5625"></wistia-player>

The way one might use this phrase/concept is like so:

> Ick, this street is loud and dangerous, I wish someone would put some cones down.

or

> that person almost got hit by that other person's car - if that intersection was properly coned it wouldn't have happened.

or

> The noise along this road is wild. if the area got well-coned, it would be way quieter. 

Here's another denver-area coning, very close to a few different climbing gyms, schools, parks, apartment buildings. I was very pleased with this one. All of these intersections by the way are STILL INADEQUATE even with these cones:

https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7249752983481732394

A fully complete intersection would have something like a built-in 'traffic curve', either a [traffic bean](https://zoningverydifferentthanours.substack.com/p/a-pattern-of-repair-the-traffic-bean), or if that is a bit too big, the 'coning' of the intersection could cause a small deviation in vehicle path.

The big issue is: if the intersection accommodates vehicles passing through it fast, say, 35 mph, without any change in direction, even a slight wiggle/deviation, it's not fully fixed.

In all these intersections, I didn't place any cones that wasn't delimiting what is already theoretically delimited, It's a good-enough proof of concept, though, and shows that with a tiny bit of work, any unwanted speed can be filtered out, by these cones, and building little gates, defined curves, turn radii, etc.

The experience of everyone NOT in a vehicle goes up enormously in these situations. It's almost dedignifying to enumerate the ways.



I am extremely aware of how dangerous roads and junctions are. [^obvious-danger] Cars feel to me as dangerous as guns, and I'm accutely aware of when a car is pointed at me, same as I'd be aware of a gun being pointed at me. 

[^obvious-danger]: Many, many people seem disconnected, emotionally, physically, with something about the experience of being in/around personal vehicles. I could rant/rave about americans, but it's really american-ness, which is a certain form of supremacy thinking. How many of your friends need to have been killed by a person driving a car, for you to have some unenjoyable emotional experiences with aspects of being around anyone who is driving? How many people that you know need to have been hit by someone in a car (but not killed!) for you to sorta not be down with the whole thing? How about animals killed? Or 

The driver of that car could kill me with the press of a foot with a car, just as the user of a gun could kill someone with the press of a finger. Check out my piece on bollards for more: [Bollards: What and Why]({{ site.baseurl  }}{% link _posts/2024-04-30-bollards.md %}).

I am unable to dissociate from shit roads and dangerous dynamics created by those road designers, and the people who use them. I've slightly unusual points of view, but I am aware of feeling something similar about roads my whole life. I am sensitive, sometimes extremely sensitive, and in ways that unavoidably inconvenience others. If you talk to some former partners, you could get long lists of ways my sensitivity and emotional delicacy has been experienced as extremely inconveniencing.

Cars, even when the engines are idling or the vehicle is electric are so loud, and one can infer so much about a vehicle and its driver from things like:

- relative ratios of accelerating, coasting, braking. (In a 100 second segment of driving, what is the ratio between accellerating, coasting, braking? How quickly does the driver cycle between the three, and how smoothly or sharply?)
- speed in many different ways - speed through curves, speed through turns

this list is simply some of the things one can infer about cars from the _noise_. Just the noise. It cuts through walls. Should I add a ðŸš— emoji every time my brain notes a car driving past? It's happened three times in the last sentance. ðŸš—ðŸš—ðŸš— catches us up to here. It's not rush hour, sometimes the vehicle frequency is much higher.

ðŸš—


Not so long ago, I ðŸš— got permission from the city engineer and mayor of Golden to try cone-based speed shaping experiments in Golden, and since then have replicated the treatment and results on many different intersections. There's a clear chronological ðŸš— unfolding. I'm pleased to have video footage of almost every treatment I've ever done. 

The 'treatment' always varies, by the way, based on the junction, how people already use it, how many cones are available, and more. The exact treatment also unfoldsðŸš—  with some iteration, ðŸš— as you'll see in some of the videos. A lot of walking around and making small adjustments. 

ðŸš— ðŸš—

i'll stop with the "ðŸš— every time a car ðŸš— drives past" because it's annoying enough to experience, let alone accommodate in my writing now. I imagine you can sympathize with me being at times resentful of how an engine or a vehicle passes by and I hear it so loudly. Cities are not loud, cars are loud. When cars are not driving around (like 'a sunday morning with 2 inches of snow on the ground') the entire area is so, so quiet. When it's really quiet, you can hear car engines from blocks away, sometimes. Sigh. 

## 1. South Denver, a pedestrian crossing of a residential road

- I lived on this street, could see the crossing being treated from the front yard of where I was staying

The cones remaind in place for weeks.

TODO: Add video footage

## 2. South Denver, noise reduction on an arterial going past cafes, breweries, lots of outdoor seating

This treatment was excellent, I'm pleased with the results, the noise level came down by so much, AND things were made way safer. 

TODO: Add video footage

The cones were taken away after a few hours

## 3. Centeral Denver, reducing noise, improving awareness

https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7249752983481732394

My friend and I did this, as we rode our scooters past, a few blocks from his house, a few blocks from two climbing gyms, grocery stores. There's a school directly adjacent to the intersection. It is not tolerable, the speeds that can be accessed by people going straight through the intersection, and how crossing it requires one to deconflict with so much space, in both directions. 

The cones we put down obviously changes the turn radii for cars, and created little 'protected pockets' for passers-by, without causing a foot or bike barrier for anyone not in a car. 

## 4. Loveland, pedestrian crossing of a four lane road with sometimes 50+mph traffic!!!

I later spent some time living adjacent to this intersection:

# General complaints about inadequate and dangerous and inefficient American intersections

Oh, I have beef with American intersections. I hate to use them, to even witness them, so I don't travel much by car, and when I do, it feels emotionally expensive. Feels like I'm walking on the graveyard of evidence of ethnic cleansing, and I cannot help but feel affected by the weight over the years of the death, bloodshed, misery, destroyed places and humans, that this whole regime represents.

Intersections in america are comically large. 

Screenshot of two different interpretations of the same intersection:

## Common complaints/FAQs:

> But Josh this is non traditional and I don't think it will work or should work.

How interesting. [Here's another video for how land is modified in expensive places to accommodate cars](https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7248901359234485550)

I contend that any modification or change to the norm is, in principal, possibly worth entertaining. 


## Misc

an early treatment in Denver, an intersection directly adjacent to an elderly person's home with lots of people walking, rolling, meandering across the street and each of them deserving to not die. 

TODO: Add that video footage

The 'building line' and setbacks are based on the roads, so every house is built up to a spot determined by the road. Even non-road space is dicated by roads!

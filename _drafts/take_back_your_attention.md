I value my attention and focus. I resent *strongly* when someone tries to take it away from me.

Someone tries to derail my attention pretty much any time I browse the internet. Little pop-ups, auto-playing videos, click-baity headlines, etc.

I've settled on a pretty good system for blocking annoying crap on the internet.

Here's the elements on a few different websites that _I_ visit regularly, with the elements I'm going to remove highlighted.

We're going to take this:

To this:

And this:

To this:

Bad:

Better:

# How to delete the crap from websites you visit regularly

First, you'll need [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock). It it is basically a tool that sits between your browser and the internet, and if any scripts are calling resources that match anything in a blacklist, it keeps the resource from loading.

From uBlock's own description:

> uBlock Origin is **NOT** an "ad blocker": [it is a wide-spectrum blocker](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode) -- which happens to be able to function as a mere "ad blocker". The default behavior of uBlock Origin when newly installed is to block ads, trackers and malware sites -- through [_EasyList_](https://easylist.github.io/#easylist), [_EasyPrivacy_](https://easylist.github.io/#easyprivacy), [_Peter Loweâ€™s ad/tracking/malware servers_](https://pgl.yoyo.org/adservers/policy.php), various lists of [malware](http://www.malwaredomainlist.com/) [sites](http://www.malwaredomains.com/), and uBlock Origin's [own filter lists](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/tree/master/filters).


It's a powerful tool. Install it for:

- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)
- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm)
- [Safari's comically complicated install process (nevermind. You have to reinstall every time you restart safari. Don't use safari. Use  Firefox instead)](https://github.com/el1t/uBlock-Safari#ublock-originfor-safari)
- [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/app/9nblggh444l4?rtc=1)


Do you have it installed? You should see a little icon in your browser with a number on it now.

OK, here's how we choose and block page elements:

Boom. Done.

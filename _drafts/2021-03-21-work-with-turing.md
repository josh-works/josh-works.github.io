A bit of an open letter_

Hey Jeff,

Like I mentioned, I wanted to outline some of the different ways I see opportunity between Turing and myself.

I believe that there's _so many good things_ that we could both have, across a bunch of ways.

I'm also want to have a chance to understand any mis-steps I've made along the way, and apologize for some of the _very_ "low-quality" bits of "help" I've provided over the years[^shell-mistakes]. For a bunch of reasons I tend to be about as subtle as this person:

[^shell-mistakes]: I know for a fact I had a gist and youtube video floating around that recommended students modify their `PS1` in a way that sometimes sorta broke their terminal, back when `bash` was the default shell instead of `zsh`. That's a different can of worms. ðŸ™„

I've been floating around the Turing community since 2017; in some high-profile ways and in some low-profile ways, almost all of it entirely accidental and unplanned. 

I _also_ want to make sure that I don't come across in the wrong way, when I discuss money in this document. 

I know that you've been been so reluctant to raise prices, because just as inflation and rising house prices has placed pressure on your own costs and profit margins, it does the same to your student's costs and 'profit margins'.

I don't think you've raised Tuition since like 2016, and the fact that Turing is _only_ $21,000 is a crazy deal. 

Just a few minutes ago, a friend who recently graduated from Turing, and is employed as a software developer, said:

> I don't think I'll ever be able to repay you for recommending Turing and saving me from "higher level education" :confounded:

Compared to college, Turing is cheap at $30,000. Compared to the monthly take-home of some stay-at-home mom, Turing is prohibitively expensive at $15,000. 

So much of what is lovely about Turing is because it's not motivated by money, but when you have $250,000/mo in payroll that you have to deposit in your staff's bank accounts every other week _or some of them don't eat_, you need to make sure you have enough cash on hand to pay them!

I love everything Turing is doing in the world; it's _really important_ to me that Turing be financially sound enough to keep doing what it's doing.

Oh, and I've got financial interests myself. I'm quite flexible, in many directions, most of which work out strongly to Turing's benefit.

I just bought a 60-year-old house, _on my wife's salary_, in a high-cost-of-living city[^cost-of-living]. she's three months pregnant, and I've got a mother-in-law I need to provide a full-time living situation for within a year. I've got a path to get there.

[^cost-of-living]: I plan on fixing the root causes of this cause of rapidly-growing generational inequality, AND SO MANY OTHER THINGS, and this "cost-of-living" problem is as interesting to me as anything related to software.

-----------------------

I want to see Turing be wildly successful, and be _the_ canonical resource for persons who want to transfer from non-software-engineers to software-engineers.

I've strongly recommended Turing to _complete strangers_, with [https://josh.works/turing](https://josh.works/turing).

I feature [Turing Prep Chapter 1: Make Mod 1 Easier Than It Otherwise Would Be](https://josh.works/turing-backend-prep-01-intro). I get a few thousand page-views a month, and quite a few front-end and back-end students that my resources have helped them a lot

I know students that have reported to me:

> Hey Josh, thanks for writing that

My friend [Akira](https://akirabrand.github.io/) recently suggested that I play this game called [Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBJ0ifVtK5c&amp;has_verified=1).

Go watch the trailer. I'll wait. 

Next, I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLgDn7szeLk), and found a few things so compelling, not the least of which being the portrayal of psychosis in the main character.

I'm not a big gamer, but _I want to play this game_.

It's available _only_ on Windows systems, and I run a Mac.

Enter [Build a Gaming PC w/ AWS](https://medium.com/@akirabrand/5e68e7cd207c)

Onward.

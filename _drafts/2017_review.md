I've got mixed feelings on annual reviews. I steadfastly refuse to set New Years' resolutions, and am even shying away from the whole idea of goals.

("not being goal oriented" is a big idea to unpack, and I'll do so eventually. I've historically been _extremely_ goal oriented, but I'm changing my tune on how healthy that is.)

However, I find review, reflection, and planning to be valuable. Here we are.

Step 1 was "what have I written in past annual reviews?"

 - 2016 review: [2016 - Biggest Lesson, Most Dangerous Books]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-01-11-2016-biggest-lesson-most-dangerous-books.md %})
 - 2015 review (bonus screenshot of an earlier iteration of this website)

 I started this whole thing in 2012, but didn't do any sort of review for 2012, 2013, or 2014. Writing that sentance confirms the value of this review - I wish I _had_ done a review those years, if for no other reason than to remind future Josh what the heck was going on in his life then.

I've got mixed feelings on annual reviews. I steadfastly refuse to set New Years' resolutions, and am even shying away from the whole idea of goals.

("not being goal oriented" is a big idea to unpack, and I'll do so eventually. I've historically been _extremely_ goal oriented, but I'm changing my tune on how healthy that is.)

However, I find review, reflection, and planning to be valuable. Here we are.

Step 1 was "what have I written in past annual reviews?"

 - 2016 review: [2016 - Biggest Lesson, Most Dangerous Books]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-01-11-2016-biggest-lesson-most-dangerous-books.md %})
 - 2015 review: [2015: The year I didn't think much?]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2016-01-23-2015-the-year-i-didnt-think-much.md %} ) (bonus screenshot of an earlier iteration of this website)

 I started this whole thing in 2012, but didn't do any sort of review for 2012, 2013, or 2014. Writing that sentence confirms the value of this review - I wish I _had_ done a review those years, if for no other reason than to remind future Josh what the heck was going on in his life then.

 <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you&#39;ve got two hours to kill the next few days write up &quot;What I learned in 2017 doing X&quot; and put it somewhere where people can read it.

Patrick McKenzie makes generally great recommendations. His recommendation pushed me over the edge.

## 2017

One thing I mentioned last year that I wanted to apply going forward was the concept of "tactical silence". (I made that phrase up). To quote myself:

> _Old Josh_ thought discussions went somewhere, and that I could change minds with words, in conversations directly about the thing I wanted to change. [...] So, now, when someone says something that is (to me) catastrophically untrue, about either myself or anything else, I just smile and nod. Even if I need to do something about it, it's rare that addressing it right then will drive any useful change.

This last year has confirmed this, but more more reasons than I'd expected. I try to give the benefit of the doubt to as many people as I can, and to hold others in a charitable position, in my own head. A fantastic way to ruin my ability to do both of these things is argue with them. About anything. If I am able to influence a person, it would be through the strength of our relationship, and through having built trust. Both of those are diminished by arguments and debates.

(There are a few people out there who enjoy discussing and debating things, for the heck of it, and I gladly jump into the fray with them.)

If the conversation gets heated, we both loose. If I somehow "win" the conversation, now I've done damage to the relationship, and I'll think less of them for sticking to their beliefs that I've now proven wrong. They, of course, will not have changed their minds because they're all human. It takes a loooong time for us to change our minds about things.

There's no winning outcome.

So, I've found that by actively avoiding topics that draw us into debate, I expend energy on other more refreshing topics. This is good.

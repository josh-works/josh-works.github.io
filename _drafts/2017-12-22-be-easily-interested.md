I've been turning my attention to cultivating interest and curiosity in things that are, well, capable of sparking interest and curiosity.

This habit seems amenable to practice. I.E. the more you look for things that are interesting, the more you find things that are interesting.

Here's an example of objects and phenomena I've encountered recently that sparked my curiosity:

- how an old bridge was constructed. (Was it held up by tension or compression? I couldn't tell)
- Some sort of surveying markers in concrete
- Why a pipe in a basement was warm
- many many more things

<!--more-->

Here's the thing. It would be very, very easy to not find them curious.

I mean, come on. This is 21st century America! We've got real things to worry about, plus smart phones, plus plenty of outrage to marinate in all day. Why be curious about a stupid bridge?

In a small way, curiosity is a potent antidote to all the mind-numbing attention-stealing crap shoved at us from every corner of the average environment.

Once I started looking for things to find curious, I found them _everywhere_. I'm glad I started looking.

This extends to people, too. I've been apologizing _regularly_ to people for what will feel like an interrogation, as I start grilling them. My go-to questions:

- What's a good book you've read recently? Why? (If not a good book, a good piece of media. Movie, TV show, documentary, comic book, cartoon, magazine, blog)
- If you could go back to {current_age - (age * .25)} and give yourself any piece of advice, knowing it was coming from current you, what would it be? Before you tell me the advice, tell me the context. What was going on in your life at the time, etc.
- What's something the world has too much of?
- What's something you look forward to about aging? What's something you fear about aging?
- Are you spiritual, or religious? Why/why not?
- What's the hardest thing you've faced in the last year?

I've asked one or more of these questions of probably more than 100 people. I've learned so much from these questions, and follow-up questions. I'll probably be asking some variation of these questions until the day I die, and that doesn't trouble me one bit.

_note: This is a google doc I wrote a few years ago, after a delightful time spent in Potrero Chico, Mexico. I thought I'd stick it here. It's been lightly edited. I'm headed to Viñales, Cuba in a few days, and was taking notes on logistics for that trip. I'll share that guide soon._

Hey there, reader! If you are reading this, you might be headed to Potrero in a few months, eh? I hope you make it, and enjoy it. 

I put this guide together a while back, as a collection of notes from the trip.



## Do you want to climb at Potrero?

The most important decision you’ll make is “should I do this?”. If the answer is “no”, well, great. You can save your time, money, and skin for another trip.

If you’re on the fence, know this:

**Potrero is accessible.** Everything is bolted, and is an easy hike. Our longest approach was one hour, and we didn’t have to bring any trad gear. Just a rack of quickdraws and a 70m rope, and you’re good to go. 

**Potrero is a break from a rough winter.** Peak season for Potrero is December through February, so you can escape [Seasonal Affective Disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder) for a week and log some miles under the sun.

**Potrero is inexpensive.** It’s not far away -just across the Mexico/Texas border - and once you’re there, you won’t need to spend much money. 

<!--more-->
**Potrero has a mind-numbing amount of sport (or “alpine sport”) routes.** You will not be able to climb a fraction of what you wish you could, and on the last day of your trip, you’ll have a list of projects to return to next time you come, which you might tell yourself and your group will be in exactly one year. You don’t have to mess around with racking trad gear, because 18 draws will get you up any route. Sometimes the bolts are a bit spaced apart, but it’s OK. You’ll be fine.

**Potrero will stretch your technical skills.** You can easily spend a week just single-pitching at Potrero, but why not pitch off into a few of the 1000-2000 foot routes? With that much vertical space, you’ll dust off (or build from scratch) many multi-pitch technical skills you may not have had to use recently. And you’ll love it. 

So, are you in? Great. Lets plan that trip!

# How to get there

El Potrero Chico is in northern Mexico, and is pretty easy to travel to. 

![where in Mexico is Potrero Chico?](/images/potrero_3.png)



Potrero Chico is located adjacent to the town of Hidalgo. Hidalgo is located outside of Monterrey, Mexico. 

## By Plane to Monterrey

If you fly, you will fly into Monterrey International Airport, (MTY), and then get transport to Hidalgo. It’s about an hour by car.

![The drive from MTY to PC](/images/potrero_4.png)

We took "the shuttle" from Monterrey to Hidalgo, and you will need exactly one resource for this: [Milton Peña](http://potrerochico.org/listing/milton-c-pena). 

The shuttle is USD $50 each way. That covers two people, and additional passengers are $10/person. He takes USD or pesos. I paid USD for the shuttle.

You can contact him at [his email address listed here](http://potrerochico.org/listing/milton-c-pena) on or, even better, on WhatsApp. If you don't have WhatsApp, it's a messaging platform that magically and easily allows you to exchange texts and voice calls with anyone in the world, for free. It's extremely handy, and it's how you'll communicate with Milton before you arrive to Mexico, so get it. [[iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/whatsapp-messenger/id310633997?mt=8)] [[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whatsapp&hl=en)].

Once you're set up on WhatsApp, you need to enter his phone number with the proper formatting. Since Whatsapp works internationally, you need to have the right country codes and number. When you first install WhatsApp, it will search through all your phone's contacts and automatically add anyone else who has Whatsapp. So, to get Milton into your contact list, you need to add him as a general contact in your phone.

Here's the proper formatting for Milton's phone number: +52 8113750831 (if your phone/address book supports it, just choose “Mexico” for the country code, and then enter everything EXCEPT the +52 part.

As a point of being polite, reach out to him on Whatsapp a few days before you arrive (to make sure your messages are actually reaching him), and then again to confirm that your plane is leaving on time. When I got to the airport for my ride to Hidalgo, he was waiting for another climber who had a weather-delayed flight, flew in the next morning, _and didn’t bother mentioning this to Milton!!!_. 

## By Car to Potrero Chico

I didn’t drive, so I cannot give good instructions, but [this guide here](http://potrerochico.org/arriving/driving) will get you all the info you need.

# Before you leave for Potrero

There's some things you'll want to do that will make your time in Mexico much easier. Here they are, in no particular order:

**Download an offline google map of Hidalgo.** Google maps does this brilliantly. Star the relevant things that you'll want to make note of, like the grocery store, the taco stand, the pizza place, and wherever you're sleeping. 

- [Directions to download an area for offline use](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/6291838?hl=en)
- I've marked some useful waypoints for you on [this public map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1t1m1uaGclkZiu4GCUQXRrqktPhE&ll=25.953288342616553%2C-100.47597694025876&z=15):

![map pins in Potrero](/images/potrero_6.png)


**Download the Google Translate app and install the Spanish package, if you don't speak Spanish really well.** Milton speaks English perfectly, and a few other people you will meet might, but it's quite presumptuous to assume that everyone will speak great English (after all, how good is your Spanish?), so you need to figure out how to get by in Spanish. 

Dredge up memories from practicing in high school, and augment with the Google Translate app. [[iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-translate/id414706506?mt=8)] [[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.translate&hl=en_US)]

[Directions to download a language for offline use](https://support.google.com/translate/answer/6142473?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&oco=1)

**Will your phone work in Potrero?** There's good cell service throughout most of Potrero, but it depends on your phone and plan type. (But not on Time Wave Zero. If you tell your wife you'll check during the day, but can't reach her until you're on the summit at 5p, she might have gotten a little worried. Just sayin’) 

Personally, I use [Google's Project Fi](https://fi.google.com/about/) and it worked great. T-Mobile has many plans that include international data, and I’ve got friend who use Sprint in Mexico without a problem. Investigate before you leave the country.


# Where to Stay

There are a quite a few options for staying in Potrero. There are hostels/campgrounds, like La Pagoda and La Posada, and there is a delightful little chalet tucked back in the mountain owned by a delightful family. It has many units in it on different levels, and can sleep a total of probably fifteen or twenty. We rented the top level for the four of us.

The chalet has everything you need. We had a few problems getting consistent power the first two days we were there, but Auriel (the owner) replaced the batteries and everything worked perfectly after that. You can reach out to them on Facebook to see about renting for your visit.

(You may want to use Google Translate to communicate ahead of the trip. Write your message in English, and copy-paste the Spanish translation to Facebook/WhatsApp/etc. When you get a response, reverse the translation. The results are not perfect, but it’s plenty to communicate the meaning. Simple sentences translate the best.)


What to pack
You'll want climbing gear, and "living gear". I'll cover the living gear that I brought, because who am I to tell you what you need to bring?

Non-climbing gear
As I mentioned, we stayed in Auriel's chalet, so your list may be different based on the amenities you’d find elsewhere. Here’s what we had and loved:
toilet paper 
sleeping bag
Starbucks Via instant coffee, OR a hand powered coffee grinder and AreoPress so we could have fresh-ground coffee. Bring your own beans. Yes, this is what I did. Yes, I like my coffee.
Cliff/Power/Builder bars or equivalent. I brought enough for two every climbing day.
Extra batteries for headlamps.
A wool buff (I could go on and on about how amazing these are. I wore mine as a scarf for sun protection, and a beanie for warmth.
Really warm and thick socks to wear after climbing/while sleeping.
Wool baselayers. It got cold at night.
Standard climbing clothing/layers
Climbing tape. (I ended up having to tape my achilles tendons to prevent nasty blisters, because my shoes were not completely broken in. It would have been quite painful to have had to do without.)
Lots of sunscreen. I did not see any for purchase in Mexico, so get a few travel-sized containers. (Remember, the TSA won’t let a big bottle on a plane.)
Good sunglasses. (I'm a sucker for polarized lenses, and have a strangely shaped head. Drop some $$$ on something like the Native Throttles. My pair has lasted me for six years, and were in great condition until I lost them in the Pacific Ocean. I replaced them.)
A towel. Sea to Summit makes great travel towels.
No need for a travel adaptor. Mexico and the United States use “Type A” plugs.
The air is dry, so if you do laundry in the sink/a bucket it will dry quickly. We did a lot of laundry by hand.

Climbing Gear
70 meter rope. Bring a 70m, even if you have to buy a new rope. You’ll use all of it, so the lighter the better.
16 quickdraws for single pitch or short multi-pitch days.
18 alpine draws for any long multi-pitch routes. When you link pitches, you’ll want extended draws to minimize rope drag. It will become obscene if you are struggling to fight 50 m of friction for your last 20m of climbing. For long multi-pitch days, bring 20 draws total, some extendable, some regular.
Headlamp and extra batteries
COMFORTABLE CLIMBING SHOES. You will curse your ancestors and the past-you who got current-you in this situation if your shoes are too tight. I got a pair of lace-up Katanas that I spent the entire week before the trip stressing that they were too big, because I could wiggle my toes. They were perfect, comfortable, and I can climb hard routes in them without a problem. (Have a good pair of shoes that’s comfortable but worn out? Get them resoled. $40 for a functionally new pair of shoes. I’ve had great experiences with Rock and Resole in Boulder, CO.
A pair of more aggressive shoes. There’s some “standard” overhung face and tufa climbing that you’ll want every bit of help you can get.
Grigri. Your backup device can be an ATC, but no one in our group used an ATC once. We simul-rappelled everything, and belayed exclusively with gri-gris. 
Helmet, obviously.
Gloves for rope handling/staying warm.
A small backpack for multi-pitch days
A means to carry at least 3L of water. We took 2L each when doing the long multi-pitch routes, but had 3L total most days. You can buy 1-1.5L bottles of water in Hidalgo.

What to Eat
Usually we ate breakfast at the chalet, lunch on the rock, and dinner in town.

Breakfasts were omelets with ham, peppers, onions, and coffee, and oatmeal with peanut butter mixed in. Coffee is a laxative for 1/3rd of the population, so a cup in the morning can prevent the need to deal with taking a poop during the day.

All of this is available at the Carniceria la Mexicana in town. It's not a quick walk, but if you ask Milton, he might be able to get you into town and/or drive you back to where you're staying. If he cannot, take a taxi, or just walk. It's a beautiful place.

Lunches were standard climber's fare of peanut butter and Nutella, bananas, oranges, and whatever Clif bars and trail mix we had on hand.

Dinners were usually at Leo's taco stand, though we cooked burritos a few times for dinner.

Money Money Money
We paid for everything in cash. When you land in Monterrey, you can withdraw pesos from an ATM. Set a travel notification with your bank or they might block the transaction. 

I brought $250 USD with me, and mistakenly didn't take any pesos to Hidalgo. The group I was with had pesos (they smartly withdrew pesos at the airport when they were there). If it were urgent, I could have gone to one of two ATMs in town.

We paid Milton in dollars, and paid Auriel for the chalet in dollars. Everything else was pesos.

What to Climb
This is the fun part.

There are many classic routes in Potrero. Alex Honnold brought El Sendero Luminoso (5.12d) to the spotlight when he free-soloed it last year. 

For us mere mortals, there are some other more appealing, and more doable routes.

First, here’s the Mountain Project link for Potrero Chico. 
Next, potrerochico.org has a great guide for the climbing. 
Finally, http://www.elpotrerochicoguides.com/ has guides for a range of classic routes, like Estrellita 5.10, Space Boyz 5.10d, 
Time Wave Zero
Time Wave Zero one of the longest sport route in the world. Twenty three pitches, and all bolted. (Mountain Project) 

It's technically rated 5.12a, but almost every pitch is 5.8 or 5.9. There are some 5.10 pitches mixed in, and a few 5.11 moves on the 2nd pitch, which you’ll do by headlamp if you get an early start. My partner and I attempted the 12a crux pitch, but ended up “french freeing” through two bolts of harder moves. 

Many others say more about Time Wave Zero than I ever could. My sole contribution is a pin on Google Maps for it's location (next to the Bronco Bowl) and a suggestion to bring fresh headlamp batteries, sunscreen, and lots of water.

You will want to have your belay station and lead-swinging skills dialed before doing Time Wave Zero. There are 23 pitches, but you'll link almost every single one. That means you and your partner will build a total of about twelve belay anchors as you go. 

Every task that takes two minutes on the belay station will add up to about 30 minutes of additional time on route.

So, think about how long you take to build your anchor off of two bolts. How long it takes to transfer gear back to your climber when transitions from seconding to leading. Etc.
Oh, and since the pitches are mostly pretty easy, try to climb quickly. You'll be doing four hundred feet of climbing at a time, so... don't dilly dally!

Oh, the last “pitch” of Time Wave Zero is just a 4th class traverse to the top. The descent back to the first set of rap rings is sketchy, and while there is a hand line, it’s not a ton of fun, so consider roping up for that bit.

Space Boyz
The best prep for Time Wave Zero  is another famous route, Space Boyz. It’s “just”
 eleven pitches, and gives you a good sampling of how spicy the climbing might be for TWZ. (I actually thought the crux moves on the hardest pitches of Space Boyz were harder than any single move on TWZ, besides the 5.12a crux moves I aided through, so if you feel good on Space Boyz, you’ll be fine on TWZ.)

You can link the first four pitches through what is called “the jungle wall”. When you get to the top of the fifth pitch, assuming you’re climbing with a 70m rope, climb all the way to the top of the ledge. There’s a very comfortable belay ledge there, and it sets you up for the next pitch far better than the slightly lower belay ledge.

Other than that, it’s pretty straightforward climbing. Everything is bolted, so you’ll have no problem following the route.

Technical Skills
If you’re planning on going to Potrero, you certainly are comfortable rock climbing. Since it’s all sport climbing, it is a gentle introduction to long multi-pitch climbing and big walls. That said, there are a few technical skills that are not common in the sport climbing world that will help your time at Potrero be awesome, and not frustrating.

Have you ever had the wind take your rope when dropping it for a rappel, and had to spend 30 minutes by headlamp trying to free it? I have. But this didn’t happen this trip, because I was prepared!

There’s a few skills you should take with you to Potrero that will save you so much time:
Reusable anchors
Quick transitions
Rope management
Efficient rappelling


Reusable Anchors
Every belay station in Potrero that I saw was a two-bolt anchor, with mostly-level bolts spaced a foot or so apart. Both pieces were always bomber.

This means you can have one 48” sling with two carabiners on it, pre-configured to be ready to clip into any anchor at any time. You will be able to build an anchor in about 30 seconds, once you’ve set this up. 

The method? A sliding-x with load-limiting knots a few inches from the ends. This was what my group of four climbers used almost exclusively for anchoring, and it allowed us to move quickly, while still having comfortable safety margins.


This is our anchor - 120cm sling with overhands in the ends. Takes about 10 seconds to set up. Photo by Josh Thompson

To head off the inevitable discussion about proper anchor-building methods - please know that this is a heavily-discussed topic all over the internet. Google around and read what others say about anchor building. There are pro’s and cons to every system.

Quick transitions
There’s not a ton you can do to speed up your actual climbing, but there’s much you can do to speed up your transitions.

One of the biggest (and easiest) wins is to just plan on swapping belay devices as you go. That way the follower can become the leader without ever having to go in direct to the anchor. Saves a few moments of finding a locking carabiner, finding space in the master point, and then undoing it all a minute later.

Read a bit more on this under point #2 from Colorado Mountain School: 
When the second climber arrives at the belay they are looking to be secured to the belay so you can switch them over to lead belaying instead of auto-block mode. 

We exchange devices at the belay so when [my partner] arrives at my anchor I can keep him secured in auto block mode while putting him on belay with his device he’s given to me. 

Therefore, [my partner] is never off belay and when he’s ready to cast off on the next pitch simply removes my device from the anchor and climbs. Quick, efficient and preemptive modes of security are my favorite!

My partner and I used Gri-Gri’s the whole time, with an auto-blocking tube-style device as a backup. No matter what belay device you use, the principle is the same.

Rope management via long loops over feet
Potrero has lots of hanging belays. I almost always chose to “saddlebag” the rope over one of my feet as my second came up. I’d make long loops, probably at least fifteen or twenty feet long, and shorten each additional rope by six inches or a foot. 

A single fifteen foot long loop, when doubled on both sides of your foot, “consumes” 60 feet of your rope. It doesn’t take many loops to handle the entire 230 foot rope.

This over-the-foot method worked great, as long as there’s not vegetation or loose rock or edges the rope can get stuck on, and as long as the rope is not hanging where the climber needs to climb. If fifteen foot loops were a problem, I’d make shorter loops as required. I never once had a problem feeding slack.

If you are NOT swinging leads, and you’re leading the next pitch, start with short loops, and go to long ones (but no longer than ten feet), and then flip them onto your 2nd when he/she arrives. This will help your rope feed smoothly, and you both will be much happier.

Rappelling 
Rappelling is one of the most dangerous parts of multi-pitch climbing. It’s the end of the day, so you’re tired, possibly cold and hungry and thirsty, it might be dark, and you’ve finished the “work” of the day, so now you’ve just begun your trip back to your cabin.

You can already taste the tacos and beer, and you’re still 500 feet up…

That’s how people die. It’s easy to rappel off the ends of your rope. Please don’t do this. Just tie a knot in the ends of your ropes when rappelling. 

Just tie a knot in the end of the rope. All the time. Two climbers died in two days at Potrero in January 2015. Don’t make that mistake.

You’ll want to know how to saddlebag your rope, and how to extend your belay device.

Saddlebagging is where you keep the entire rope coiled on your harness while you rappel. Since you’re not tossing it, you don’t have to worry about wind or cactuses or cracks. Since we were using a single rope to rappel, Brian and I had to manage only half of the rope. It was quite easy and quick to rig when we needed it.

You’d want to extend your belay device for all sorts of reasons - it makes it easier to clip into the next set of anchors, it’s easier to manage the brake strand of the rope, and it’s mandatory for auto-blocking.

Miscellaneous Items
General Fitness
You’ll probably hike quite a bit in Potrero. It’s not at high altitude, but after hiking a few hundred vertical feet, you might feel a bit fatigued. Especially because you might be carrying a rope, draws, three liters of water, food, etc. 

Anyone who spends much time with me will probably hear an endorsement for two-handed kettlebell swings. This Tim Ferris article got me started. A few weeks of swings 2x/week will help those hikes feel easy and relaxing, instead of exhausting. 

Paying for it all
You can plan on spending a few hundred to make this trip happen. Flights are probably at least $300, you will spend at least $150 on accommodations, plus a bit more for food, and $50 for the shuttle round trip, assuming you split the ride with at least one other person. (Don’t blame me for over-spending in any category!)

That’s $600, and I’d round up to at least $800, just to be fun.

While you might be tempted to say “I’ll throw this on my credit card” and enjoy it, don’t do that. 

I’m going to use a terrible word. Budgeting. 

Ew. Budgeting. Shoot me now, or talk about the reproduction cycles of a plant, or something. Anything is more fun to talk about than budgeting.

Not so fast. This is important to talk about for two reasons:
Love it or hate it, our world runs on money. If you think you’ll just fly by the seat of your pants and not make any firm decisions about it, you will have your decisions made for you by someone else. I promise you won’t like the decisions they make.
Money is so touchy because it’s an extension of ourselves, and the way we use it/manage it says things about us. 

I’ve got two resources for you: 
I Will Teach You To Be Rich by Ramit Sethi. Terrible title, awesome book. At least go read the Amazon reviews.
YouNeedABudget. This tool changed how my wife and I manage our money, and we feel way less stress now than we once did. (For example, I saved up for my trip to Potrero, so buying the tickets and withdrawing the cash was guilt free! It felt great.)

You made it this far! So many words, pictures, and links. If you’re still on the fence, check out this sweet video:



And that’s it! I’ve shared I think all I’ve got in my head on Potrero. Leave questions in the comments, and I’ll jump in and give answers, and we can update the article as needed!

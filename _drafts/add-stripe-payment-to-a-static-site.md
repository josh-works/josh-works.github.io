I've had rolling around my head an idea of selling small how-to guides, things that I wish existed, but have never been able to find. 

> Josh, why would you _sell_ something like this, instead of giving it away for free?

### I want to learn how to collect payment for something

For better or worse, much of the world revolves around exchanging money for services. Lets say I've figured out a valuable thing, and I can teach you how to do this thing. 

If the thing I can help you do is valuable to you, you will pay me a fraction of the perceived value to obtain said service. 

So, I'm going to build a mini-course as a proof-of-concept, that will teach _you_ how to sell something online, and collect money through a payment gateway. 

_I always teach what I know_. There's a running joke among my friends and co-workers that "Josh has written a gist about everything". 

I keep copious notes and document all the things. I love to teach others and help them, so "selling a product about how to sell a product" fits right in line with _teach everything I know_. 

> How do I know that you can do what you claim to be able to do? 

### The proof is in the pudding

For a few dollars, you'll experience the quality of the work I can do. 

Lets say this small course costs $15. If the "build quality" and is high, you'll get a sample of the quality of the product you'll get. 

If the build quality is low, as you work through the payment experience, you'll say "meh, not worth my while" and back out. 

> What if the course is bad, and I want my money back/

### I'll build a 'click this button to refund the purchase' button (and I'll teach you to build the same)

If I'm selling a course online, of course I'll offer a 100% refund for an unsatisfactory experience. 

At a prior job, I spent a lot of time dealing with refunds, so I'd rather not do that today. I'll build (and will teach you how to do the same) an automatic refund button so _you can get your money back at any time_. 

> Sounds like people will just buy this and then refund themselves the money, and you won't make anything

### Refund rates on quality products are low, and I don't want to try to keep those kinds of people as customers

Good products solve problems, and deliver in value far more than what they cost. 

By the time someone's purchased the course and done much of it at all, they'll realize it's worth far more than what they've spent on it. That group of people won't arbitrarily run a refund.

If there is anyone that's not satisfied with the material, of _course_ I'd want to refund them their money, no questions asked.

So, what about the last group, those who are satisfied by the material, but still want the refund? They probably break down into two groups:

##### 1. Short on money

Imagine you're learning software development, but are still working long hours in a low-wage job. You might not have the time to try to learn something cool yourself by just brute-forcing it, and spending a dozen hours trying to figure something out. 

(I expect it's going to take me more than a dozen hours to figure this all out and build the course). 

Further, if you're supporting others and/or have very low wages, a course like this could be prohibitively expensive. 

If that's you, _I want you to have the course_. So, you can pay the money (just to get the full experience) and then immediately refund the money back. 

I hope that anyone that falls in this category, who also wants access to the material, will be able to learn what they want. 

If down the road they land a sweet developer job, or their situation changes for the better, sure, come pay the full price, but I don't really care.

##### 2. Generally poor customers

I've worked at a few different software companies, in a variety of roles. I've logged the most years on customer support and sales teams. 

There's always a class of organization or person who creates a lot of hassle for not a lot of revenue. These are customers that most organizations would try to placate, but the best companies I worked for called it 'firing the customer'. 

If someone was abusive to the support team, or was rude in every interaction, or was jumping through hoops to always get refunded, we'd just tell them something like:

> It seems we're not a good fit for each other. We've refunded all your money, and hope you find a service out there that can solve [this problem] for you. It won't be us, though. Good luck!


### When someone does something for free, they are telegraphing to the recipient that it's not worth any money

We, as humans, ascribe value to that which has evidence of value. If have two things, and one was free and the other cost money, I'm going to value the thing that cost the money more.

The thing that I'm building will deliver value. Value that is far greater than what it will cost. If I made it free, _you would not value it as much_. 

I've [put together a lot of resources for students getting ready to start Turing](). Someone going to Turing is spending $20,000 and taking nearly a year off from earning any money to learn the skills of writing software. 

They've got a lot invested in the program. 

I built a [_quite_ comprehensive guide]() to getting _super prepared_ for the back-end program. It's got detailed instructions, video walkthroughs, and more. 

I put this guide in front of every new student going through the back-end program. I drop it in their cohort Slack channel before Turing starts. 

You know how much interest it generates? Invariably, _almost none_. The actual value of the material is enormous, but almost no one ascribes significant value to it. 

I've considered putting a price on it, just so it doesn't get lumped in with all the other free stuff out there... but I have not, and never will.

_I want to write about how my thinking evolved on topics related to emotional maturity, styles of conflict in conversation, abuse, and violence. I have dramatically changed the way that I prefer to engage with certain people on certain topics. Imagine me holding my hand to my waist, saying 'your emotional maturity must be this high for me to give you an earnest response.'_

_emotionally immature people wreak havoc on the world around them, through behaviors and words that boil down to abuse and neglect. When children do it, adults manage their own internal state and do not punish the kids, but try to help them regain a state of nervous system regulation, and compassionate aid with an attitude of mutualism. Emotionally immature adults functionally punish their children for the adult and the child's immaturity, in a way that children should never be treated._


Last year, a friend introduced me to this book: [Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents: How to Heal from Distant, Rejecting, or Self-Involved Parents](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23129659-adult-children-of-emotionally-immature-parents)

It ruined me. I downloaded it on my Kindle as soon as I next had wifi, and had lightbulb moment after lightbulb moment as I read it. 

A few months earlier, I'd read [The Verbally Abusive Relationship: How to Recognize It and How to Respond](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/402366.The_Verbally_Abusive_Relationship)

That book also was full of lightbulb moments. Many lovely memories from my childhood, and marriage, snapped into focus. 

Before even _that_ book, I read [Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20556323-complex-ptsd), and again, full of lightbulb moments.

I was on my way to having a child, and a few reputable sources had recommended I read [Parenting from the Inside Out: How a Deeper Self-Understanding Can Help You Raise Children Who Thrive](https://www.amazon.com/Parenting-Inside-Out-Self-Understanding-Anniversary/dp/039916510X)


A theme through these books:

1. Power imbalances are real. Parents over children, men over women. teachers over students. white-passing people (in america) over non-white-passing people (in america). english language over non-english language. Literate over non-literate. more money over less money. 'educated' over 'less/non-educated'
2. It matters how we treat people. We can build up, and tear down, with our words. If we're unsure of our impact on others, or unwilling to accept when we have a hurtful impact on others, we have additional work to do. Those who willingly hurt others, especially those vulnerable or less powerful than themselves, should not be welcomed in society and should be appropriately shunned and aided in improving their behavior. If unwilling to change, they should remain on the outskirts, though they shouldn't be punished. Just walled off from their victims.

Some of the abusive people in my life acted like children, when told that their behavior was greviously painful.

> What? What? I don't understand. Why do you bring this up? Just forget it, move on.

> I don't even remember what you're talking about. Stop bringing it up.

> I don't understand [and I am unwilling to try to understand]. I refuse to consult any other resource to aid me in understanding. 

> You're the problem. You're too sensitive. Stop crying. Just do what I told you to do. 

> I wouldn't be upset with you if you didn't make me upset with you. You're responsible for your pain. 

All of this language would be draped over an emotional attitude of utter neglect and distance. The second book I read

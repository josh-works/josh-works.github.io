_the last two years have been extremely trying. so hard. so, so hard. Feels like the destruction of everything I'd loved and hoped for, in particularly tragic and painful ways._


my last review, which I published months late because the first few weeks of 2020 absolutely wrecked kristi and I: [https://josh.works/2020-review](https://josh.works/2020-review)

i skipped 2021's annual review, but i'm going to backfill (down below), because 'current me' is highly related to the stories I tell about myself. I've not had stories that make sense for a long time.

2022 has been a big year. Here's some highlights, as I free-associate through the year, reviewing my calendar and high points and low points.

### Eden

She started 2022 as a three month old, is now a year older. I love spending time with her. I could write a book of thoughts of being a father. I'm immensely pleased to be a father, and to learn all the many ways I can cultivate relationship, friendship, connectedness, and psychological safety with Eden.

Some formative books:

- [Parenting from the Inside Out: How a Deeper Self-Understanding Can Help You Raise Children Who Thrive: 10th Anniversary Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Parenting-Inside-Out-Self-Understanding-Anniversary/dp/039916510X)
- [The Art of Roughhousing: Good Old-Fashioned Horseplay and Why Every Kid Needs It](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594744874/ref=x_gr_w_bb_sin)
- [How to Raise an Adult](https://www.amazon.com/How-Raise-Adult-Overparenting-Prepare/dp/1250093635)

There's a lot more I want to say about Eden, I'll get there eventually.

### Scooters

This year my primary vehicle was a scooter, I rode it all around the front range, eventually took it to Canada and back. 

That trip was life changing. Here's a photo album of my trip to canada: [pictures](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipN8q_LjvazfURfQUjnI21GQz23_PqlznCQ2fYC6OYCy15AIypU47XTi5S_mPdtaMw?key=N29iaXpDYXI5X2pFVjBUTGpQQmE5TmZTSnYyci1R)

There's so much more I could say about my scooter, and I will in fact say more about it soon. For now, enjoy this [tik tok video I made](https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7182723738415156522?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1)

and a map of all my travels with several years of ownership: [https://josh-strava-heatmap.herokuapp.com/](https://josh-strava-heatmap.herokuapp.com/)

### Divorce

Kristi and I got a divorce. 

Technically, she initiated a "legal separation", and was careful to tell me that despite the language on the paperwork talking about the "dissolution of the marriage", she didn't want a divorce, "just" a legal separation. [^whats-the-difference]

This had already been bad for a long time. I maintain that there was persistent, unapologetic, unremediated, ongoing instances of verbal and emotional abuse, and when I was trying to achieve a sense of safety in the relationship, I was being met with emotional control, abandonment, and verbal coercion. In general, I dislike being coerced, so feeling verbally coerced daily was devestating to my wellbeing. I [wrote this](https://josh.works/depression) while I was in the thick of it, but before I realized the full scope of what is a fairly boring story:

> Wounds from childhood have an affect on our ability to perceive safety and engage in trust-building activities as adults. In some situations, these childhood wounds _don't matter at all_. In other situations, our reactions/responses to events might  be completely dominated by those childhood wounds. To the degree they have a negative effect on others, we're responsible for our actions and words. 

I'd been _literally_ thrown out of the house multiple times, hearing angry words echoing in my ears as I left. And here's where the trauma kicks in - when someone that we look to for comfort also is someone who hurts us, _and doesn't repair after damage occurs_, our nervous system gets very, very aware of danger. I remember begging Kristi to be a bit more thoughtful and gentle in how she treated me, because I could _feel_ the harm setting in. If someone does nothing but upset you, and you cannot both return to a spot of psychological peace and attunement, resentment build and builds. 

If I'd known how this would have all played out, I would have made a bunch of decisions over the last two years differently. Perhaps things would have gone less bad. I've felt _profound_ sadness for so long it's hard to remember feeling any different way, and when I think back to when I _did_ present as 'not depressed', I wonder how much of it was masking or avoiding the emotional pain I was in. There were warning signs a long time ago. 

[^whats-the-difference]: The difference between a legal separation and a divorce is small. It's basically a divorce, but allows the couple to avoid saying they got a divorce. All the "important" paperwork is the same - mandatory financial disclosures, a plan for the separation of assets, and a parenting plan, all brought before and signed off by a judge.

I found out Kristi was filing for a separation the day before her lawyer filed with Jeffco Courts petitioning for the dissolution of our marriage. When I was eventually forced to lawyer up, I was so disgusted by how I'd been treated throughout the process, I asked if the legal separation, which is _almost identical_ to a divorce, could be converted to a divorce, and it was. There is very little difference between divorce and separation, both can involve highly coercive interactions with a legal system.)

Kristi and I were not on the same side of some key issues, specifically around patterns of verbally coercive behaviors.

It's been a slowly-unfolding tragedy. I'll forever be on the side of "speak to others gently, it's wrong to pour anger on someone continuously without self-reflection or adjustment." Gottman's "[Four Horsement](https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-four-horsemen-recognizing-criticism-contempt-defensiveness-and-stonewalling/)", etc. The Bible speaks about love, gentleness, compassion, kindness. I was treated with controlling behaviors, verbal abuse, and emotional abandonment. I was yelled at, had doors slammed in my face, and was brought to tears _nearly daily_ in interactions with Kristi, all without repair or apologies, beyond a dry and dismissive "I'm sorry you feel that way". 

Eventually, I labeled certain patterns as "verbal/emotional abuse", and things just got worse, not better.

If Eden were experiencing something similar, I'd say the same. If I were doing this to someone, I'd hope the offended party would be able to defend or insulate themselves from my behavior. Even when upset and disregulated, it's not permission to be abusive to others. It's reasonable to request a change in how someone is speaking to you. You deserve relationship repair efforts. systematic stonewalling and defensiveness is toxic to the brain, and your sense of self. 

I wrote more about all these dynamics [here](https://josh.works/context-setting-around-certain-classes-relationship-difficulties) a while ago. 

### Re-evaluating how I show up in relationships

If you sample from among people who know me, you'd hear things like "Josh is idealistic" and "Josh gets excited about things, and often doesn't follow through on them". "Josh thinks nearly anyone can learn nearly anything". I have elements of codependency in me (please see: "childhood trauma"), and feel at times _devestatingly unworthy_ and _helpless_. When I feel compassionate, I can make space for these things and can affirm that I actually do have worth and agency. 

As a child, I was continuously invalidated and stripped of my agency. It'll take time to ferret out the difference between "who Josh is" and "josh's trauma responses". The last few years have been extremely difficult. As I've essentially left the institution known as the evangelical church, I've found other relationships, beyond the relationship with Kristi, that I had expected to persist with me into 2022 and 2023. I was wrong about some of them, they didn't persist into the future, and in a really discouraging and pathetic way, I lost even more of the supports that I'd not expected to lose.

Again, in hindsight, lots of this feels like it was inevitable, and of course certain people wouldn't be able to "show up" in certain ways, but Like I just said, I'm idealistic and believe that changing mental patterns isn't that hard. `:lolsob:`

I spent most of this year in various states of pain, and when I'm in certain kinds of emotional pain, _I am unwell_. This is true for anyone. 

I read [The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma](https://www.amazon.com/Body-Keeps-Score-Healing-Trauma/dp/0143127748), [Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20556323-complex-ptsd), [Healing the Shame that Binds You](https://www.amazon.com/Healing-Shame-Binds-Recovery-Classics/dp/0757303234). [Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents: How to Heal from Distant, Rejecting, or Self-Involved Parents](https://www.amazon.com/Adult-Children-Emotionally-Immature-Parents/dp/1458794016/ref=asc_df_1458794016/) I'm a bit more sophisticated when it comes to the relationship between "internal emotional states" and "interactions with others that promote feelings of danger or safety" than I once was. I only wish I'd read these books years earlier. 

At my worst, I am codependent, a manipulative people-pleaser, and desperately want someone else to help me solve all of my problems. It's obviously a bad look, and, well, if I wasn't able to solve it before, I'm about to be 33, might as well start trying to resolve the root problems now. Maybe by the time I'm 35 I'll have some of this resolved.

At my best, I can be pretty great. I'd built a lot of my life around building routines that helped me be well, and work from a position of wellbeing, but the wheels started coming off _that_ bus in 2020. 

### Homebot

I started a job at Homebot in March, and then got laid off right before Christmas. Ups and downs along the way. Some people find job loss to be catastrophic, i'm not _yet_ super affected by it. I'm more aware of how I let others down than anything else, and the sadness and disappointment I feel is rooted there. I wasn't doing well at my job, and at least some of the reason was this divorce stuff. I was already in a bad way at the beginning of the year, and just got worse and worse as the year went on.

I'd originally gotten the job because I had to give up on other projects I was working on, and wasn't yet able to insulate myself from the abusive patterns at home. I was going through a devestating, fairly high-conflict divorce while also trying to be a productive member of a small platform engineering team. I couldn't manage my emotional state, and felt _severely_ depressed. I could sometimes don the hat of a fairly healthy and curious engineer, and when I did that, I am proud of the work I did, but when I was by myself, and profoundly sad, I just spun my wheels. 

Prior to Homebot I'd had a few other projects not work out, so I'm doing a bunch of work around trying to make sure my sadness and ability to do useful engineering work are not so directly linked. 

### Depression

Depression. So much depression and sadness. Tears nearly daily. Related to the divorce, and topics that surround "verbal abuse". There's been shame, embarrassment, sadness. 'abandonment malaise', etc. In 2021 I'd found myself experiencing 'passive suicidal ideation' [as I mentioned](https://josh.works/depression). I don't think I'll ever end my own life, but I've found myself feeling a much greater degree of felt empathy for people who do take that path. The rate of suicide in this country is _extremely high_, and I think it's almost exclusively a reflection of how difficult it is to find opportunities for healthy relational interdependence and meaningful projects to spend time on. 

I could launch into a diatribe about the modern world, dropping quotes from Ivan Illich about the industrialized world, etc, but that's tired territory. If you need to be convinced that 'the modern world' can be atrocious, I'm not the right person to talk about that with. 

Tragedy abounds, nearly everywhere, and it's something that "we" do to "ourselves". By that I mean: instances of humans do bad things, or fail to do good things, to other instances of humans, and the resulting total experienced suffering is substantial.

Oh, I've 'given myself the diagnosis' of "complex PTSD", which symptomatically overlaps with labels like ADHD, depression, autism, bipolar disorder, and more. All of this is, IMO, manifestations of emotional trauma as a result of parents abusing their children under the guise of 'loving them'. 

If you know, you know. If you've not experienced or witnessed this kind of thing, good for you! If you do witness abuse, the best response is to _witness_ it. Here's why:

The difference between abuse and mistreatment is the effect it has on the victim. Abusers _generally_ blame the victim for their mistreatment, or attack the victim by telling them they either deserve the treatment, or that the treatment isn't bad. The presence of a witness, in the life of the victim, can substantially ameliorate the harms of the abuse by clearly labeling the treatment as such:

> {treatment} is wrong, and should never be done to anyone. You deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. That pain you're feeling is well-grounded. 

### Chronic back pain

My back has been better than it was after the injury in late 2020, but I am still regularly affected by it. I can walk and stand upright, though. I have not gone on a run since before the injury, and as someone who could knock out 15 miles of hilly trail running at elevation, it's been a loss to not be able to do that anymore. 

I think for a long time I used physical activity for emotional self-regulation. I climbed hard, ran a lot, and biked lots. 

In hind sight I don't know how much of it was to avoid/manage emotional pain and to get time with friends. At least some of it. 

The amount of emotional pain/stress I was enduring went up dramatically after we moved into the house in 2020, and the amount of quality stress relief and time with friends went down dramatically after we moved. (Because of covid, my injury, and changed life circumstances.)

I wanted to rely on Kristi from some support and encouragement, and kept being told "nope, no can do, talk to your therapist if you want to be encouraged."



### Jesus Christ

I've long had a relationship with evangelical christianity best described as "it's complicated". 

I think I've finally clarified all the bits and pieces, and am close to landing on an understanding of the implications of the historical figure known as 'Jesus of Nazareth' that is coherent, and _critically_ is separate from the legacy of slavery, ethnic cleansing, and abuse that is so intimately connected to evangelical christianity.

I don't really care for the language of 'deconstruction', or `exvangelical`, because it's giving too much power and control to what amounts to "an incorrect view of the world." I am not currently attending a church, and I feel like many in the "christian community" end up being complicit in the abuse of others, via downstream effects of "Slaveholder Christianity" and the Anselmian view of satisfaction. (AKA "The Violent Atonement".)

Here's a concise view of my formal break with evangelical chrisianity. It came slowly, across many years, and then quickly. 

Lots of this story began with experiences I had while spending a semester abroad in Beirut, Lebanon. I began seeing cracks (small and large) in the 'worldview' I'd been given, in 2010. Fast forward to reading [The Problem of Political Authority](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15794037-the-problem-of-political-authority) and some books by Chalmers Johnson in 2018 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalmers_Johnson#Blowback_series) and I was fully dissilusioned with all the trappings of American empire and authority. 

There were plenty of other books and movies in there, but the "God-level" earthy authority of 'the state' that I'd been taught to reveare was no longer something that I reveared.

I read [The Origins of Proslavery Christianity: White and Black Evangelicals in Colonial and Antebellum Virginia](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2507760.The_Origins_of_Proslavery_Christianity?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=j6NMKjVlEn&rank=1) in 2017, and it affected me powerfully. The book gave language to this thing called "paternalism", which is a collection of attitudes/beliefs required for one person to justify dominating the life of someone else. ("For their own good").

That book wrecked me. I couldn't unsee the tight relationship between inter-ethnic group conflict played out between black and white evangelicals (and black and white non-evangelicals), and how hard whites worked to create an intellectual justification for the ongoing enslavement of black people. It would be one thing to say 

> we [ethnic group] have enslaved you [ethnic group] for no other reason than 'we can'

It's quite another to say 

> we've enslaved you for your own good

But evangelicals in Virginia (and the rest of the country) went to great lengths to justify slavery _for the good of the enslaved_. 

I kept finding overlap between the self-justifications of racists to enslave entire people groups and things I grew up enduring in my own household. My dad had often found a happy home in the baptist/southern baptist denominations, which meant I went to those churches growing up too. From that book, I learned the southern baptists split off from the baptist denomination because the baptists were _insufficiently pro slavery_ for the southern baptists.

Damn. 

Anyway, I next stumbled backwards into learning about the anabaptists. I read a book, and was prompted to write: https://josh.works/whats-up-with-anabaptists

I kept reading from anabaptist traditions. I heard about and then read [The Politics of Jesus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19133.The_Politics_of_Jesus), which affected me deeply. I wrote https://josh.works/was-jesus-ethics-normative as a response.

I next read [The Nonviolent Atonement](https://www.amazon.com/Nonviolent-Atonement-J-Denny-Weaver/dp/0802849083) and [The Work of Jesus Christ in Anabaptist Perspective: Essays in Honor of J. Denny Weaver](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4495703-the-work-of-jesus-christ-in-anabaptist-perspective), and wrote a few more pieces, trying to synthesize what I was learning:

- [Notes on, and quotes from: The Politics of Jesus (Yoder, 1972, 1994)](https://josh.works/the-politics-of-jesus-notes-quotes)
- [The Violence of God and the Hermeneutics of Paul](https://josh.works/the-violence-of-god-and-the-hermeneutics-of-paul)
- [The Apostle Paul and the Introspective Conscience of the West (Harvard Theological Review, 1963)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/harvard-theological-review/article/abs/apostle-paul-and-the-introspective-conscience-of-the-west/4172993A034F101DAD79981809A47F52)
- [White Too Long: The Legacy of White Supremacy in American Christianity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52764767-white-too-long)

I was ruined. I was learning too much about how politically powerful ethnic groups were using 'legal' authority to conduct regimes of ethnic cleansing. 

Furthermore, my own marriage was drowning under the weight of abuse and neglect. I've been reading and re-reading various things I've written, from long before I was married, to even after I was married, and I often read my words with a mix of sadness and regret. I was so bound by shame, trying so hard to earn love and affection and comfort and security from anyone. I thought if I could perfectly manage my behavior and thoughts, I'd finally be a 'good person', and might feel a modicum of relief. Didn't work out as I'd hoped, which was also what I'd been taught by nearly every trusted authority my whole life.





- Pruning some relationships. It's been a difficult year, and it was with great sorrow (and relief) that I put a pause on some relationships in my life that I'd historically tried to maintain and lean on. Basically, right now, in relationship, I need certain minimums of emotional maturity. I've started trying to set some boundaries around [emotionally immature behavior](https://www.amazon.com/Adult-Children-Emotionally-Immature-Parents/dp/1626251703), so there's a bit less of that in my life, but it's been borne out of pain and sadness, so I don't yet count this as "a big win"
- Deep dive on patterns of verbal and emotional abuse. I [wrote this](https://josh.works/context-setting-around-certain-classes-relationship-difficulties) some time ago to explain what was going on.
- Letting others down. I wrote about [depression](https://josh.works/depression) a year and a half ago, and have gotten better at seeing signs of it (in me and others) but for a bunch of reasons, have kept getting _more_ depressed. I've let many, many people down. For a bunch of reasons, much of (maybe too much of) my identity came from helping others. There's ways this can be healthy, there's ways this can be unhealthy. I am, at times, absolutely convinced I'm a total piece of trash that does nothing but burden others, and cannot figure out what is so wrong with me.
- Rammed Earth and dignified structures. I went to Canada to learn to build buildings out of rammed earth. Learned a ton, and with a few friends and some time I think I could do it. I hope to be more involved in the space next year. The time and effort I've put into this kind of domain (buildings and "dignifying structures") has been an incredible antitode to the deep depression, malaise, and sadness I've been feeling.
- Composting. While living at our house in Golden (I no longer live there) I'd started composting humanure per [The Humanure Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0964425882/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&psc=1). I put some notes [here](https://github.com/josh-works/til/blob/main/house/composting-at-my-house.md). It worked incredibly well, was completely non-noxious non-stinky, and was a lot of fun. I hope to do it again some day. It's hard to beat having a bathroom in every room.
- Mobility networks. I've been obsessed with them. I still don't know what I'll do with it, but I've been putting videos of mobility networks in action on tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@joshthompson5395
- Trying to sort out how to be a good dad, even though divorced. I think these early years of Eden's life are critical, so despite what some have said ("Oh, the first few years of Eden's life she won't remember, it doesn't matter too much."), I want to be available to help Eden have one more person that she can build a healthy and safe relationship with. I'd had the expected-and-yet-discouraging experience of many people (who I've not spoken to in a long time) reach out and assume that I'm "cutting and running" or something. To which I respond "what do you know of the efforts I've taken over the last three years to move this relationship (and both parties in the relationship) to a state of health?"

### Articles

Maybe discuss these with your partner. Maybe not. I tried everything I could to save my marriage. It's now over. Maybe forever, maybe not. I was quick to tell people "it's possible for a couple, who gets a divorce, to get re-married. At any point whatever way of interacting that conveys kindness and compassion and mutualism is probably the right one."

I had an intuition that detailed knowledge of each other was the best way to build mutalism and trust. I was continuously spurned in my efforts to get to know Kristi better, and for her to get to know me better. That said, here's a starting point for further reading on 'how to build good relationships'.

- no coated pans, cast iron and stainless and ceramic only
- threw out all plastic in the kitchen that had gone through the microwave or dishwasher, all replacement plastic was hand-washed

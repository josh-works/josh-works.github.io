_the last two years have been extremely trying. so hard. so, so hard. Feels like the destruction of everything I'd loved and hoped for, in particularly tragic and painful ways. I've learned lots, but it's been brutal. I aspire to be an open book, but often feel deep, deep shame. There's a difference between healthy shame and toxic shame, I've experienced plenty of both. If you don't wanna get into the weeds on some hard life circumstances, maybe skip this post._

_I know I don't have to write only about technical things or mundane things on this website, but it's vastly easier to do so, and hide away the difficult and fraught bits of one's life. There are things I've learned and books I've read (which I mention below) that I wish I had encountered a long time ago, so as always, if anything that I write is helpful to someone else, either now-ish or many years from now, I am happy to write._

_I'm hoping to find a good path for myself, for Kristi, and for Eden. I look forward to a friendship with Eden for the rest of my life, and aspire to an amicable relationship with Kristi, and believe completely that it's possible_


My last review, which I published months late because the first few weeks of 2020 absolutely wrecked kristi and I: [https://josh.works/2020-review](https://josh.works/2020-review)

I skipped 2021's annual review, but I'm going to backfill, because 'current me' is highly related to the stories I tell about myself. I've not had stories that make sense for a long time. 2020 and 2021 was a year of exploration and individuation, which sorta culminated in the tumultuousness of 2022.

2022 has been a big year. Here's some highlights, as I free-associate through the year, reviewing my calendar and high points and low points.

### Eden

She started 2022 as a three month old, is now a year older. I love spending time with her. I could write a book of thoughts of being a father. I'm immensely pleased to be a father, and to learn all the many ways I can cultivate relationship, friendship, connectedness, and psychological safety with Eden.

Some formative books:

- [Parenting from the Inside Out: How a Deeper Self-Understanding Can Help You Raise Children Who Thrive: 10th Anniversary Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Parenting-Inside-Out-Self-Understanding-Anniversary/dp/039916510X)
- [The Art of Roughhousing: Good Old-Fashioned Horseplay and Why Every Kid Needs It](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594744874/ref=x_gr_w_bb_sin)
- [How to Raise an Adult](https://www.amazon.com/How-Raise-Adult-Overparenting-Prepare/dp/1250093635)

There's a lot more I want to say about Eden, I'll get there eventually.

### Scooters

This year my primary vehicle was a scooter, I rode it all around the front range, eventually took it to Canada and back. 

That trip was life changing. Here's a photo album of my trip to canada: [pictures](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipN8q_LjvazfURfQUjnI21GQz23_PqlznCQ2fYC6OYCy15AIypU47XTi5S_mPdtaMw?key=N29iaXpDYXI5X2pFVjBUTGpQQmE5TmZTSnYyci1R)

There's so much more I could say about my scooter, and I will in fact say more about it soon. For now, enjoy this [tik tok video I made](https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7182723738415156522?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1)

and a map of all my travels with several years of ownership: [https://josh-strava-heatmap.herokuapp.com/](https://josh-strava-heatmap.herokuapp.com/)

### Divorce

Kristi and I got a divorce. 

Technically, she initiated a "legal separation", and was careful to tell me that despite the language on the paperwork talking about the "dissolution of the marriage", she didn't want a divorce, "just" a legal separation. [^whats-the-difference]

The state of our marriage had [already been bad for a long time](https://josh.works/context-setting-around-certain-classes-relationship-difficulties). I maintain that there was persistent, unapologetic, unremediated, ongoing instances of verbal and emotional abuse, and when I was trying to achieve a sense of safety in the relationship, I was being met with emotional control, abandonment, and verbal coercion. In general, I dislike being coerced, so feeling verbally coerced daily was devestating to my wellbeing. I [wrote this](https://josh.works/depression) while I was in the thick of it, but before I realized the full scope of what is a fairly boring story:

> Wounds from childhood have an affect on our ability to perceive safety and engage in mutualistic and trust-building activities as adults. In some situations, these childhood wounds _don't matter at all_. In other situations, our reactions/responses to events might  be completely dominated by those childhood wounds. To the degree they have a negative effect on others, we're responsible for our actions and words. 

I'd been _literally_ thrown out of the house multiple times, hearing angry words echoing in my ears as I left. And here's where the trauma kicks in - when someone that we look to for comfort also is someone who hurts us, _and doesn't repair after damage occurs_, our nervous system gets very, very aware of danger. I remember begging Kristi to be a bit more thoughtful and gentle in how she treated me, because I could _feel_ the harm setting in. Walking on eggshells, being afraid of drawing unwanted attention, or failing to do something I should have done and "earning" more resentment, withdrawal, and harsh words. If someone does nothing but upset you, and you cannot both return to a spot of psychological peace and attunement, resentment build and builds. 

If I'd known how this would have all played out, I would have made a bunch of decisions over the last three years quite differently. Perhaps things would have gone less bad. I've felt _profound_ sadness for so long it's hard to remember feeling any different way, and when I think back to when I _did_ present as 'not depressed', I wonder how much of it was masking or avoiding the emotional pain I was in. There were warning signs a long time ago. I can pretty skillfully pretend like everything is fine, and I can put on a pleasent and kind demeaner. I am also deeply affected by sadness, so depending on which one of those versions of me you "see", you might think "Josh seems totally fine" or "Wow, Josh seems a bit of a mess."

[^whats-the-difference]: The difference between a legal separation and a divorce is small. It's basically a divorce, but allows the couple to avoid saying they got a divorce. All the "important" paperwork is the same - mandatory financial disclosures, a plan for the separation of assets, and a parenting plan, all brought before and signed off by a judge. It seems like "separation" was created by the american legal system to give couples an option to effectively end their marriage without technically "ending the marriage". Kristi said that for religious reasons ("God says divorce is wrong") she didn't want a divorce. A healthy marriage is built on mutalism, kindness, compassion, and lots of "shared" things. (Time, attention, interest, affection, goals), so when the good things disappeared, and I spent nearly every day for two years being treated poorly by Kristi... I ended it. 

I found out Kristi was filing for a separation the day before her lawyer filed with Jeffco Courts petitioning for the dissolution of our marriage. When I was eventually forced to lawyer up, I was so disgusted by how I'd been treated throughout the process, I asked if the legal separation, which is _almost identical_ to a divorce, could be converted to a divorce, and it was. There is very little difference between divorce and separation, both can involve highly coercive interactions with a legal system.

Kristi and I were not on the same side of some key issues, specifically around patterns of verbally coercive behaviors and repairing from conflict.

It's been a slowly-unfolding tragedy. I'll forever be on the side of "speak to others gently, it's wrong to pour anger on someone continuously without self-reflection or adjustment." Gottman's "[Four Horsement](https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-four-horsemen-recognizing-criticism-contempt-defensiveness-and-stonewalling/)", etc. The Bible speaks about love, gentleness, compassion, kindness. I was treated with controlling behaviors, verbal abuse, and emotional abandonment. I was yelled at, had doors slammed in my face, and was brought to tears _nearly daily_ in interactions with Kristi, all without repair or apologies, beyond a dry and dismissive "I'm sorry you feel that way". My yattempts to improve the situation with words kept gettiong shut down with verbal violence. My attempts to loop in family or friends or therapists all went nowhere. I'm deeply distressed by my inability to improve the situation for such a long time, and I still reflect daily on "what went so wrong, what does this reveal about me/my own patterns that I can fix going forward."

Eventually, I labeled certain patterns as "verbal/emotional abuse", and things just got worse, not better.

If Eden were experiencing something similar, I'd encourage her to do the same - create space and safety for herself, and if she continues to be treated in ways that telagraphed disrespect and lack of dignity, even if the root is "the aggressor doesn't like or respect themselves, and this is why they're hurting you", she has no obligation to continue to stay in a hurtful situation. 

If I were doing this to someone, I'd hope the offended party would be able to defend or insulate themselves from my behavior. Even when upset and disregulated, it's not permission to be abusive to others. It's reasonable to request a change in how someone is speaking to you. You deserve relationship repair efforts. systematic stonewalling and defensiveness is toxic to the brain, and your sense of self. 

This section of this annual review is _really_ fraught for me to write about. I know several people who've gotten divorced, but in the communities in which I was raised, divorce was treated with _extreme_ shame. There was  almostnever a situation where it was considered justified, and this has been a time of re-evaluating both my religious upbringing, and family dynamics I've been a part of for a while. 

### Re-evaluating how I show up in relationships

If you sample from among people who know me, you'd hear things like "Josh is idealistic" and "Josh gets excited about things, and often doesn't follow through on them". "Josh thinks nearly anyone can learn nearly anything". I have elements of codependency in me (please see: "childhood trauma"), and feel at times _devestatingly unworthy_ and _helpless_. When I feel compassionate, I can make space for these things and can affirm that I actually do have worth and agency. 

I believe that unless I can provide something of value to someone else, I don't deserve to take up space in their life. I'd built too much of my identity around being helpful to Kristi and friends and family, so when I lost access to being helpful to Kristi, I felt underskilled in showing up in friendship, too. I'm working on fixing that. Folks say it takes three years to recover from a hard divorce (financially, emotionally, etc) so I'm trying to be generous to myself, but I'm also very tired of living in so much emotional pain. 

I still believe nearly anyone can change in any way, if they want.

Again, in hindsight, lots of this feels like it was inevitable, and of course certain people wouldn't be able to "show up" in certain ways, but Like I just said, I'm idealistic and believe that changing mental patterns isn't that hard. `:lolsob:`

I spent most of this year in various states of pain, and when I'm in certain kinds of emotional pain, _I am unwell_. This is true for anyone. 

I read [The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma](https://www.amazon.com/Body-Keeps-Score-Healing-Trauma/dp/0143127748), [Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20556323-complex-ptsd), [Healing the Shame that Binds You](https://www.amazon.com/Healing-Shame-Binds-Recovery-Classics/dp/0757303234). [Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents: How to Heal from Distant, Rejecting, or Self-Involved Parents](https://www.amazon.com/Adult-Children-Emotionally-Immature-Parents/dp/1458794016/ref=asc_df_1458794016/) I'm a bit more sophisticated when it comes to the relationship between "internal emotional states" and "interactions with others that promote feelings of danger or safety" than I once was. I only wish I'd read these books years earlier. 

At my worst, I am codependent, can be a manipulative people-pleaser, and sometimes want someone _else_ to help me solve all of my problems. I can clearly and correctly enumerate some of the immaturities I displayed in highschool and college, but as we get closer to me of today, I am less able to identify _in an actionable way_ enough of my immaturities. Sigh. [^embarrassed-by-past-self]

[^embarrassed-by-past-self]: If I meet someone today that I knew in high school, I offer a plain and straight-forward and honest apology for some ways they may have been _correctly_ offended by my behavior. I can do this because I've got a grab-bag of classes of errors I know I made then and can speak to them. I've been met with surprise, then assent/affirmation: "Yeah, that was offensive, and I was offended. That said, I appreciate this. Apology accempted." I can do some similar things for college me. I'm absolutely more mature in some ways now at 33 than I was at 22 and 17. I wonder what 43 year old me will be saying about 33 year old me.

At my best, I can be pretty great. I'd built a lot of my life around building routines that helped me be well, and work from a position of wellbeing, but the wheels started coming off _that_ bus in 2020. I'd like 2023 to be a year of putting the wheels back on the bus.   [^wheels-back-on-bus]

## Making stuff

Part of putting the wheels back on is getting back in the habit of "creating things", across the domains that are interesting to me. 

"Making stuff" also can correlate with useful job outcomes, and certain jobs are vastly more convenient than others. 

Part of 'making money' is doing useful things that create value, and finding what parts of 'making something' provokes a sense of shame. My therapist and I have discussed this in the past, and part of the way trauma can affect how we engage in the world is thinking that despite some people looking at us with contempt (which results in 'internalized shame') because of the things we make/interests we display, not everyone will look at us with contempt, _or_ we can actually handle/metabolize any resulting sense of shame, and be unaffected or improved by it. 

That thing called 'perfectionism' also has roots in how we gain/lose safety/security relative to meeting certain standards. 

Obviously the real world is full of those tradeoffs (mistakes can and do cost people time, money, and health, all the time), but we can take actions that help others and ourselves feel a bit more comfortable and secure, or the opposite. All else equal, everyone's better off the more anyone can correctly feel more comfortable and secure. 

So, I've got ideas around explaining concepts and making interesting-enough pieces of 'content'. Some of that content is in the form of these words, on this domain, being read into the set of eyeballs you're using while looking at whatever screen you're looking at, but me typing these words into my laptop isn't necessarily my favorite form of 'creating'.

I'm playing with making videos and "explainers" using at least some video to explain concepts related to 'mobility networks'. Maybe I'll do companion blog posts, and there's cool javascript-based animations I could see working alongside blog posts. You know how a good animation helps you better understand a complicated concept? I want to make resources to better visualize/contextualize what currently feels like some complicated concepts, with the outcome of eventually having/using a better mobility network.

I've got good taste in many domains, taste that _vastly_ outweighs my ability to execute. [^the-gap]

[^the-gap]: Ira Glass talks about "the gap" between your taste and your ability in this beautiful little video: [THE GAP by Ira Glass (vimeo)](https://vimeo.com/85040589)

But simply _practicing_ for volume of created work is often a very good way to go, if you're not sure what to do next. If you want to get good at something, instead of doing it five times really slowly, do it 1000 times fast. 

To that end, here's my tiktok account: [@josh_exists](https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists)

I'm putting drone videos up, and starting to get video from my scooter as I ride around. I've already learned a TON about making these videos since I've started putting videos on Tiktok. Maybe I'll write about it sometime. 

Here's an example of a video I made that I like a lot about:

<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7184632222257777962" data-video-id="7184632222257777962" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;" > <section> <a target="_blank" title="@josh_exists" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists?refer=embed">@josh_exists</a> <a title="urban_infrastructure" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/urban_infrastructure?refer=embed">#urban_infrastructure</a> <a target="_blank" title="♬ Calm Down - Rema" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Calm-Down-7060633760082511873?refer=embed">♬ Calm Down - Rema</a> </section> </blockquote> <script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script>

_I could give a 3 minute talk about why I found this video interesting as we walk through it, and you'd walk away thinking "huh, that's interesting too"._

I don't really care (yet) about overall "engagement", and sometimes hide spicy ideas behind intentionally dull or difficult content, but I know some of the stuff I say/do is rather polarizing. I've certainly got something that could be called 'childish irreverence' buried deep in my soul, and it comes out sometimes, with and without my awareness. 

I am also practicing [anarchist calesthenics](https://harpers.org/archive/2012/12/anarchist-calisthenics/). For example, on my scooter, and with my drone, I've 100% violated written law in a variety of ways. Some mundane, some less so. Some of that I record (like flying my drone above 120m, or passing through a red light at an intersection, with or without first coming to a complete stop). [^anarchist-calesthenics]

[^anarchist-calesthenics]: From [this article](https://harpers.org/archive/2012/12/anarchist-calisthenics/): As a way of justifying my conduct to myself, I began to rehearse a little discourse that I imagined delivering in perfect German. It went something like this: “You know, you and especially your grandparents could have used more of a spirit of lawbreaking. One day you will be called on to break a big law in the name of justice and rationality. Everything will depend on it. You have to be ready. How are you going to prepare for that day when it really matters? You have to stay ‘in shape’ so that when the big day comes you will be ready. What you need is anarchist calisthenics. Every day or so break some trivial law that makes no sense, even if it’s only jaywalking. Use your own head to judge whether a law is just or reasonable. That way, you’ll keep trim—and when the big day comes, you’ll be ready.”

I'm also sometimes playing with the video formats that Tiktok enables - leaving video replies to other people's videos, reading sections from books, etc. 

I'm trying to make it easy/engaging to 'read along' a few rather spicy books I've read lately. 

Some I've mentioned in this article already. 

There's books that allocate page space to the intersection of 'evangelicalism' and [ethnic cleansing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing), and _we all know someone who's of a people group that's been on the wrong side of ethnic cleansing_, and it's actually quite difficult and effortful to do actual ethnic cleansing, so the more we can indentify it and make sure we're not accidentally supporting it, the better we'll all be. 

Broadly, I'll be "making stuff". 

I'm also drawing, writing, working on some more software, etc. My forms of "creating" are, at their best, not navel-gazey _at all_![^navel-gaze] 

[^navel-gaze]: unlike the navel-gazing happening in _this_ post. 🙄


## Homebot

I started a job at Homebot in March, and then got laid off right before Christmas. Ups and downs along the way. Some people find job loss to be catastrophic, but I'm not _yet_ super affected by it. (I drafted these words a day or two after it happened, and it remains true when I'm publishing it a week later). 

I'm more aware of how I let others down than anything else, and the sadness and disappointment I feel is rooted there. I certainly wasn't self-evaluating as 'doing great work' for a variety of reasons, and the industry Homebot is in was affected by market trends. I spent more than a few work-hours in *profound* sadness over the my onedegrading marriage, and didn't feel great about my own value creation in the role. I think in hindsight I could see ways to make better decisions and manage everything better, but for a few reasons didn't get it right-enough in the moment. That said, I consider myself really fortunate to have been at such a healthy company and working with such kind people during what was a very difficult time in my life. I loved having the office, and the sense of kindness and teamwork that was _distinctive and visible_ at Homebot. I've had a variety of work experiences, and would certainly recommend Homebot to someone interested in joining a high-performing team.

I'd originally gotten the job because I had to give up on other projects I was working on, and wasn't yet able to insulate myself from the abusive patterns at home. I was going through a devestating, fairly high-conflict divorce while also trying to be a productive member of a small platform engineering team. I couldn't manage my emotional state, and felt _severely_ depressed. I could sometimes don the hat of a fairly healthy and curious engineer, and when I did that, I am proud of the work I did, but when I was by myself, and profoundly sad, I just spun my wheels and felt overwhelmed and unable to reach out for help.

Prior to Homebot I'd had a few other engineering-related projects not work out, so I'm doing a bunch of work around trying to make sure my sadness and ability to do useful engineering work are not so directly linked. 

### Depression

Depression. So much depression and sadness. Tears nearly daily. Related to the divorce, and topics that surround "verbal abuse". There's been shame, embarrassment, sadness. 'abandonment malaise', etc. In 2021 I'd found myself experiencing 'passive suicidal ideation' [as I mentioned](https://josh.works/depression). I don't think I'll ever end my own life, but I've found myself feeling a much greater degree of empathy for people who do take that path. The rate of suicide in this country is _extremely high_, and I think it's almost exclusively a reflection of how difficult it is to find opportunities for healthy relational interdependence and meaningful projects to spend time on. 

I could launch into a diatribe about the modern world, dropping quotes from Ivan Illich about the industrialized world, etc, but that's tired territory. If you need to be convinced that 'the modern world' can be atrocious, I'm not the right person to talk about that with. 

Tragedy abounds, nearly everywhere, and it's something that "we" do to "ourselves". By that I mean: instances of humans do bad things, or fail to do good things, to other instances of humans, and the resulting total experienced suffering is substantial.

Oh, I've 'given myself the diagnosis' of "complex PTSD", which symptomatically overlaps with labels like ADHD, depression, autism, bipolar disorder, and more. All of this is, IMO, manifestations of emotional trauma as a result of parents abusing and/or neglecting their children under the guise of 'loving them', and that treatment has an ongoing affect on the child. 

If you know, you know. If you've not experienced or witnessed this kind of thing, good for you! If you do witness abuse, the best response is to _witness_ it. Here's why:

The difference between abuse and mistreatment is the effect it has on the victim. Abusers _generally_ blame the victim for their mistreatment, or attack the victim by telling them they either deserve the treatment, or that the treatment isn't bad. The presence of a witness, in the life of the victim, can substantially ameliorate the harms of the abuse by clearly labeling the treatment as such:

> {treatment} is wrong, and should never be done to anyone. You deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. That pain you're feeling is well-grounded. 

I'm thankful for those who have witnessed to me the various mistreatments I've experienced. 

### An old back injury

My back has been better than it was after the injury in late 2020, but I am still regularly affected by it. I can walk and stand upright, though. I have not gone on a run since before the injury, and as someone who could knock out 15 miles of hilly trail running at elevation, it's been a loss to not be able to do that anymore.

I think for a long time I used physical activity for emotional self-regulation. I climbed hard, ran a lot, and biked lots. 

The amount of emotional pain/stress I was enduring went up dramatically after we moved into the house in 2020, and the amount of quality stress relief and time with friends and Kristi went down dramatically after we moved. (Because of covid, my injury, and changed life circumstances.)

I wanted to rely on Kristi from some support and encouragement, and kept being told "nope, no can do, talk to your therapist if you want to be encouraged." 

### Jesus Christ

I've long had a relationship with evangelical christianity best described as "it's complicated". 

I think I've finally clarified all the bits and pieces, and am close to landing on an understanding of the implications of the historical figure known as 'Jesus of Nazareth' that is coherent, and _critically_ is separate from the legacy of slavery, ethnic cleansing, and abuse that is so intimately connected to the story of evangelical christianity in the USA.

I don't really care for the language of 'deconstruction', because it's giving too much power and control to what amounts to "no longer adhering to a certain view of the world." Christianity/evangelicalism today is irredeemably perverted via downstream effects of [Slaveholder Christianity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2507760.The_Origins_of_Proslavery_Christianity) and the Anselmian view of satisfaction. (AKA [The Violent Atonement](https://www.amazon.com/Nonviolent-Atonement-J-Denny-Weaver/dp/0802849083).)

Here's a concise view of my formal break with evangelical chrisianity. It came slowly, across many years, and then quickly:

Lots of this story began with experiences I had while spending a semester abroad in Beirut, Lebanon, in 2010. I began seeing cracks (small and large) in the 'worldview' I'd been raised with. Fast forward to reading [The Problem of Political Authority](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15794037-the-problem-of-political-authority) and some books by [Chalmers Johnson] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalmers_Johnson#Blowback_series) in 2018 and I was fully dissilusioned with all the trappings of American empire and authority. 

There were plenty of other books and movies in there, but the "God-level" earthy authority of 'the state' that I'd been taught to reveare was no longer something that I reveared.

I read [The Origins of Proslavery Christianity: White and Black Evangelicals in Colonial and Antebellum Virginia](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2507760.The_Origins_of_Proslavery_Christianity?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=j6NMKjVlEn&rank=1) in 2017. The book gave language to this thing called "paternalism", which is a collection of attitudes/beliefs required for one person to justify dominating the life of someone else. ("For their own good"). It was via 'theologically justified [paternalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paternalism' that white land-holding men in america justified the horrific, genocidal treatment of enslaved populations of African descent. 

Incidentally, now that I am also a _parent_, I can separate 'being a parent' from 'advocating for paternalism'. I look forward to a friendship with my adult child, therefore every time I am with her, I seek to build _healthy relationship and skills_, and I certainly don't force her to adhere to a ridgid belief in 'authority'. 

That book wrecked me. I couldn't unsee the tight relationship between inter-ethnic group conflict played out between black and white evangelicals (and black and white non-evangelicals), and how hard whites worked to create an intellectual justification for the ongoing enslavement of black people. It would be one thing to say 

> we [ethnic group] have enslaved you [ethnic group] for no other reason than 'we can'

It's quite another to say 

> we've enslaved you for your own good

But evangelicals in Virginia (and the rest of the country) went to great lengths to justify slavery _for the good of the enslaved_. 

I kept finding overlap between the self-justifications of racists to enslave entire people groups and things I grew up enduring in my own household. My dad had often found a happy home in the baptist/southern baptist denominations, which meant I went to those churches growing up too. From that book, I learned the southern baptists split off from the baptist denomination because the baptists were _insufficiently pro slavery_ for the southern baptists.

Damn. 

Anyway, I next stumbled backwards into learning about the anabaptists. I read a book, and was prompted to write: https://josh.works/whats-up-with-anabaptists, which among other things shares the first ten sentances from the introduction. 

I kept reading from Anabaptist traditions. I heard about and then read [The Politics of Jesus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19133.The_Politics_of_Jesus), which affected me deeply. I wrote https://josh.works/was-jesus-ethics-normative as a response.

I next read [The Nonviolent Atonement](https://www.amazon.com/Nonviolent-Atonement-J-Denny-Weaver/dp/0802849083) and [The Work of Jesus Christ in Anabaptist Perspective: Essays in Honor of J. Denny Weaver](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4495703-the-work-of-jesus-christ-in-anabaptist-perspective), and wrote a few more pieces, trying to synthesize what I was learning:

I was ruined. I was learning too much about how politically powerful ethnic groups were using 'legal authority' to conduct regimes of ethnic cleansing. 

I've been reading and re-reading various things I've written, from long before I was married, to even after I was married, and I often read my words with a mix of sadness and regret. I was so bound by shame, trying so hard to earn love and affection and comfort and security from anyone. I thought if I could perfectly manage my behavior and thoughts, I'd finally be a 'good person', and might feel a modicum of relief. Didn't work out as I'd hoped, which was also what I'd been taught by nearly every trusted authority my whole life.

## Rammed Earth Buildings & other forms of dignified living

I've always had an eye for beautiful buildings and cities, and that impulse got turned up to 11.

I rode my moped to Canada to learn to build buildings out of rammed earth. Learned a ton, and with a few friends and some time I think I could do it. I hope to be more involved in the space next year. The time and effort I've put into this kind of domain (buildings and "dignifying structures") has been an incredible antitode to the deep depression, malaise, and sadness I've been feeling.

While living at our house in Golden (I no longer live there) I'd started composting humanure per [The Humanure Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0964425882/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&psc=1). 

I put some notes [here](https://github.com/josh-works/til/blob/main/house/composting-at-my-house.md). 

It worked incredibly well, was completely non-noxious non-stinky, and was a lot of fun. I hope to do it again some day. It's hard to beat having a bathroom in any room you want one. Dramatically reduces water usage and sewage run-off. 

I'd recommend getting the book, reading it cover to cover, and then getting started with the composting. Get some buckets and sawdust and 4 pallets and a few hay bales, and you'll be good to go. (re-read the book, though. Each time I read it again, I pulled more tips and tricks out of it)

## Mobility networks

I've been obsessed with them. I still don't know what I'll do with it, but I've been putting videos of mobility networks in action on tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@joshthompson5395

## Fatherhood/paternal/maternal instincts

I am trying to sort out how to be a good dad, even though divorced. 

I think these early years of Eden's life are critical, so despite what some have said ("Oh, the first few years of Eden's life she won't remember, it doesn't matter too much."), I want to be available to help Eden have one more person that she can build a healthy and safe relationship with. I'd had the expected-and-yet-discouraging experience of many people (who I've not spoken to in a long time) reach out and assume that I'm "cutting and running" or something. To which I respond "what do you know of the efforts I've taken over the last three years to move this relationship (and both parties in the relationship) to a state of health?"

I'm allowing myself to feel sad and terrible for how some bits of my life have gone.

### Articles

Maybe discuss these with your partner. Maybe not. I tried everything I could to save my marriage. It's now over. Maybe forever, maybe not. I was quick to tell people "it's possible for a couple, who gets a divorce, to get re-married. At any point whatever way of interacting that conveys kindness and compassion and mutualism is probably the right one."

I had an intuition that detailed knowledge of each other was the best way to build mutalism and trust. I was continuously spurned in my efforts to get to know Kristi better, and for her to get to know me better. That said, here's a starting point for further reading on 'how to build good relationships'.

### Lifestyle changes

Kristi and I had been trying for a while to get pregnant. Not had success. 

We ended up applying as much of _It Starts with the Egg_, to get hormone-distrupting chemicals out of our diet. This looked like:

- no coated pans, cast iron and stainless and ceramic only
- threw out all plastic in the kitchen that had gone through the microwave or dishwasher, all replacement plastic was hand-washed
- a few other things recommended by the book
- mostly eliminated sugar
- ate like healthy vegetarian/pescatarians

I'm starting to write more regularly these days. For a long time, I've hardly written anything, or only written when external circumstances required me to write something. For example, when I give a talk, I always create a page to "support" the talk, that I can link to in slides, like [https://josh.works/railsconf](https://josh.works/railsconf) and [https://josh.works/gasb](https://josh.works/gasb).

I don't apologize (usually) when replying to email "slowly", and when others apologize to _me_ for their own "slow response", I send them this article: [Let’s All Stop Apologizing for the Delayed Response in Our Emails](https://www.thecut.com/2017/04/stop-apologizing-for-the-delayed-response-in-our-emails.html).

I've always written primarily for myself (current and future versions of me) and this post is no exception. It's about depression, and my experience with it. 

A year ago, I began noticing unavoidable signs of depression in myself, and noticed that those things had been going on for about a year. 

There were a range of trying circumstances I found myself dealing with. The standard kit of "downsides of the human experience": Death, injury, sickness, strife, despair. Obviously these unwanted influences were affecting the entire world in very public and well-discussed ways, but in specific ways (and in ways unrelated to Covid), these ill winds made intrusions into my own life.

I also found that it felt like my depression was _choosing for me_ certain pathways that made it harder for me to do the kinds of self-care things I usually do. As this happened, my capacity to absorb difficulty diminished, and my ability to provide care for others also diminished. These phenomena were working together in ways that caused a negative feedback cycle. 

A few months ago, this thought started passing through my head:

> Hey, I should take a stab at writing about this depression thing.

Then, immediately after that, I'd think:

> Ew, I don't want to do that. That's uncomfortable.

And of course, as is true in many situations, it's healthy to do that which is uncomfortable. 

My depression is/was, in many ways, a reasonable response to certain circumstances (death in family, acute _and_ chronic health problems). But my depression _also_ has explanatory power for other visible phenomena. It is a response to some things, and it has _caused_ other things.

I've always found difficult problems to be made more manageable by writing them down. Many other people, much wiser than I am, underscore the same phenomena. 

## Why I am writing about depression: Current and future me will benefit (and maybe others will too)

I've not written very much in the last four years, and I've written almost nothing at all for the last year and a half. I've written 23 posts since 2020, and most of them were things that I "had" to write, to support conference talks I gave, presentations, or "explainers" for papers, tutorials, etc. Nothing where I wrote for the sake of making sense of my own life or the world around me.

For contrast, I wrote over 50 posts in the prior two-year period; many of those posts _were_ contributing to me making sense of the world around me.[^comparing-trends]

[^comparing-trends]: It's not a perfect strategy, but a way I grew to observe my own depression was to find ways that my behaviors had changed compared to times that I know I wasn't depressed. Writing has always been a big part of how I operate in the world, and I observed a strong aversion to any kind of biographical writing, which has historically not been the case.

There's other trends and concepts I want to write about, but the "story" doesn't make sense until I can explain "Oh, yeah, I was super depressed for a long time, and that's why I did these things, and didn't do these other things."

I write these words primarily for myself, right now, while knowing that because of how the internet works, a future version of me might benefit when I re-read these words, or others will benefit. 

I've read a few posts on the topic, where people have expressed some degree of surprise, or they'll have an "ahah" moment, when they realize they've been depressed (or exhibiting signs of depression) for an extended period of time. 

https://zellwk.com/, https://twitter.com/patio11/, and many others. Most of the articles, talks, conversations I've read on the topic of experiencing depression, I don't even remember many specific details. Just a sense of "Hm, this resonates". 

Their words have been of benefit to me. Also, there is a "right time" to capture certain thoughts:

## Causal Arrows

It's hard for me to offer enough qualifying statements about everything I'm writing here. Certain circumstances contributed to my depression. My depression, in turn, contributed to other circumstances. What follows is a bit of me free-associating through a narrative response to:

> - what led to my depression
> - how did it manifest in my life?  
> - how did I come to eventually observe it
> - now what?

In January of 2020, Kristi's dad/best friend, died suddenly and unexpectedly. It was a tremendous loss, both in obvious ways, and in ways that are difficult to enumerate. Kristi was 30. We'd hoped for decades more time together. It's still a painful loss, and will always be painful. 

Her dad (who was a 3rd-generation baker, and had run a bakery in the town his entire life) was a fixture of his town; there was well over 500 people at his funeral. He (and by extension the bakery, and his entire family) positively impacted thousands of people.

I spent a lot of time reflecting on my own life and my eventual death. 

Kristi and I were able to spend two months back east, in NJ, to help her mom and family pick up the pieces. An advantage of working in the tech industry: we've both worked remotely for many years, we have near infinite location flexibility.

Shortly after spending those two months in NJ, which was a rather trying time, I gave my notice at Proofpoint. There are always many reasons people change jobs, or in this case, quit jobs with no explicit plans to go back to full-time, W2 work, and this was no exception. I loved the team I was on, but it was the right time to move on to something else.

Shortly after I gave my notice, but before my last day, Covid started being a thing, and the lockdowns started. (I was given many opportunities to _not_ quit, and instead ride out Covid with a well-paying engineering job. Proofpoint was in a strong spot, and was one of the companies that _grew_ because of the pandemic)

My last day of work was the last day of March; I'd had a climbing trip to Cuba planned, and that obviously didn't happen.

I did some contract work for Turing, the software development program I went to in 2017. I have been mentoring students in the backend program for years, and I reached out to see if they were open to more of help, since I suddenly had a lot of time on my hands, and I always really enjoy helping others be successful in the industry. Turing was eager for help.

I also did some engineering work on internal Turing school applications, like their enrollment and payments applications.

I always take detailed notes, like when I added Rubocop to two of their applications. [These notes will help anyone else who needs to do something similar](https://github.com/josh-works/intermediate_ruby_obstacle_course/tree/main/rubocop). 

I remember training on a Tension block in Ocean City, NJ, early July 2020, using a very specific right hand grip, working on rehearsing one of the last hard moves on [Apocalypse](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/115133440/apocalypse) in Rifle, CO. 

I'd _casually_ done hard-for-me boulder problems that spring[^hard-for-me-boulder-problems], and was excited/hopeful to see some of the bouldering power I'd obtained get me up some harder routes. 

[^hard-for-me-boulder-problems]: I did a few v8s in a single session, sometimes after just four or five attempts. Given that I'd never imagined myself a "strong climber", I never thought V10 (or 5.13+) was attainable to me. Turns out it is. To most normal people, V10 is very, very hard. I also know some V13+ climbers that make V10 look easy and casual. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 

And then in July, I got home, and just... stopped. I've been climbing for over 15 years now, and never have I ever taken and unforced break from climbing, other than a few weeks here and there, with some "active rest" to keep the tendons from thinking they're not needed anymore, usually worked in between some training/performance cycles. 

I stopped climbing cold turkey, late July. Hardly touched the wall through November, when my wife and I bought a house, and then I managed to absolutely eff up my back in a horrible way. 

I could barely walk. I spent weeks being unable to do anything. I wasn't healthy or strong enough to move furniture around or hang things on walls, so I also didn't have an ergonomic workspace set up. 

I'd done some interviewing; I got an offer at $130k/yr (!!!) at a local software company, but declined, because I had another opportunity (at the same equivalent pay) for contract technical writing for a teeny tiny startup that will, I think, be extremely successful, and you will absolutely hear about the company some day. 

My depression was particularly bad then, _but I didn't even realize I was depressed_; I just felt extremely anxious and sad most of my waking hours. 

After 10 days with the startup, I told the founder that it wasn't working for me. We had a 12 time difference, and the work was managed in a bit of a haphazard way. I wasn't able to draw a good line between working and not working. I'd worked straight through Thanksgiving weekend, and was just in a terrible place, emotionally. 

The company was based on the other side of the globe, and didn't have a lot of async communication practices in place, and too much of my time was spent regaining/sharing context, and feeling like my time wasn't being well spent when the team was asleep, and then feeling bad about that. 

The founder was bummed I was leaving, and I still am too. I think if I'd been even half-way emotionally well, that role would have been a ton of fun, and I could have made impacts above and beyond what we'd both hoped for. 

My capacity for work was greatly diminished by physical injuries, the year of depression, covid lockdowns, and having my traditional sources of stability (climbing, my marriage) were instead sources of difficulty.

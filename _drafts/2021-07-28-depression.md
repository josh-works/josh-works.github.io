I don't ever apologize for the cadence of when I do/don't write on this website. You have no right to expect any sort of regular writing, nor any obligation to read what I happen to write. 

I don't apologize (usually) when replying to email "slowly", and, in fact, when others apologize to _me_ for not having responded to my message, I send them this article: [Letâ€™s All Stop Apologizing for the Delayed Response in Our Emails](https://www.thecut.com/2017/04/stop-apologizing-for-the-delayed-response-in-our-emails.html).

A few months ago, this thought started passing through my head:

> Hey, I should take a stab at announcing to the world that, for the last year-and-a-half, I've been depressed. I've had dips in and out of particularly acute stages. > 
> 
> The depression is, in ways, a reasonable response to circumstances (death in family, acute and chronic health issues with me and my wife), and the depression has explanatory power for other visible phenomena. 

And then a moment later, my brain would say:

> Nope, that's too uncomfortable. I don't want to. 

And that meant I'd probably end up doing it eventually. Looks like today's the day.

## Why I am talking about depression

### Current and future me will benefit

I write these words primarily for myself, right now, while knowing that because of how the internet works, a future version of me might benefit when I re-read these words, or others will benefit. 

I've read a few posts on the topic, where people have expressed some degree of surprise, or they'll have an "ahah" moment, when they realize they've been depressed (or exhibiting signs of depression) for an extended period of time.

https://zellwk.com/, https://twitter.com/patio11/, and others. Most of the articles I've read on the topic, I don't even remember who wrote. Just a sense of "hm, this resonates". 

Their words have been of benefit to me.

## Causal Arrows

In some ways, the last year-and-a-half of depression was shaped by external circumstances. For example:

> Kristi's dad, who was her best friend, died suddenly and unexpectedly in January, 2020. 

I don't even like to write about this. Her dad was a fixture of the town. There was well over 500 people at his funeral. I spent a lot of time reflecting on my own life and eventual death. 

Kristi and I were able to spend two months back east, in NJ, to help her mom and family pick up the pieces. None of Kristi's siblings were able to be there that long. This loss was a heavy, heavy blow, and marks in my mind the beginning of this more recent chapter of the story. 

Then, a week or so after getting home from that trip, I gave my notice at Proofpoint. Shortly after I gave my notice, Covid started being a thing, and the lockdowns started.

My last day of work was the last day of March. 

I'd had a climbing trip to Cuba planned, but that went away.

I did some contract work for Turing, the software development program I went to in 2017. I have been mentoring students in the backend program for years, and I reached out to see if they needed some help, since I suddenly had a lot of time on my hands, and I always really enjoy helping others be successful in the industry. 

I also did some engineering work on internal Turing school applications (like their enrollment and payments application). 

I always take detailed notes, like when I added Rubocop to two of their applications. [These notes will help anyone else who needs to do something similar](https://github.com/josh-works/intermediate_ruby_obstacle_course/tree/main/rubocop). 


## Observations

It was late July that things took a turn. I know they did, because I spontaneously stopped training for climbing (and actually climbing). It was initially worrying to me, but I figured between it being summer and a rough year, a few weeks off would be fine. 

I remember training on a tension block in Ocean City, NJ, using a very specific right hand grip, working on rehearsing hanging on to one of the last hard moves on [Apocalypse](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/115133440/apocalypse) in Rifle, CO. 

I'd _casually_ done hard-for-me boulder problems that spring, and was excited/hopeful to see some of the bouldering power I'd obtained get me up some harder routes. 

And then in July, I got home, and just... stopped. I've been climbing for over 15 years now, and never have I ever taken and unforced break from climbing, other than a few weeks here and there, with some "active rest" to keep the tendons from thinking they're not needed anymore, usually worked in between some training/performance cycles. 

I stopped climbing cold turkey, late July. Hardly touched the wall through November, when my wife and I bought a house, and then I managed to absolutely eff up my back in a horrible way. 

I could barely walk. I spent weeks being unable to do anything. I wasn't healthy or strong enough to move furniture around or hang things on walls, so I also didn't have an ergonomic work space set up. 

I'd done some job interviewing. I got an offer at $130k/yr at a local software company, but declined, because I had another opportunity (at the same equivalent pay) for contract technical writing for a teeny tiny startup that will, I think, be extremely successful, and you will absolutely hear about the company some day. 

My depression was particularly bad then, but I didn't even realize I was depressed.

I just felt extremely anxious and sad most of my waking hours. 

After 10 days with the startup, I told the founder that it wasn't working for me. I'd worked straight through Thanksgiving weekend, and was having problems drawing clear lines between work/non-work time. 

The company was based on the other side of the globe, and didn't have a lot of async communication practices in place, and too much of my time was spent regaining/sharing context, and feeling like my time wasn't being well spent when the team was asleep, and then feeling bad about that. 

The founder was bummed I was leaving, and I still am too. I think if I'd been even half-way emotionally well, that role would have been a ton of fun, and I could have made impacts above and beyond what we'd both hoped for. 

My capacity for work was greatly diminished by physical injuries, the year of depression, covid lockdowns, and having my traditional sources of stability (climbing, my marriage) were instead sources of difficulty.

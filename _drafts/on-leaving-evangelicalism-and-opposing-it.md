# Content warning

_Statistically, most of the 'normal'  people in my life, and the normal readers of this website, are not particularly interested in the content of this post. (it's not about software development, scooters, or rock climbing)_

_These words have been brewing in my head for a long time, circulating the events of my life over the last few years._

_I've wanted to express aspects of this to others, particularly to those in my life who come from a religious background. Specifically, those who would call themselves evangelical or protestant._

_There's often some judging elements to how some seem to want to interact with me, and I want to strenuously object and say_

> _'just because you cannot effortlessly understand what I am doing doesn't mean it is non-sensical, please, please try to engage with me on this, I promise it'll make sense.'_

_They quote scripture at me. or, rather, obliquely reference some bit of scripture, and if I start prepping my own defense, they seem to fade away, na'er to be seen again. Sigh._

_That said, I spent my formative years, and many of the years of my adult life, firmly ensconced in the evangelical church traditions, and I've now firmly left it, and am tired of getting accused of an odious offense, to me, which is "Josh is doing things that don't make sense, and cannot be understood by any reasonable person."_ 

_This post is an explanation of how, without ever intending to, I found myself to have walked out of that camp, and am now firmly planted in semi-heretical theological hinterlands, from the point of view of those remaining in the evangelical tradition._

_Hilariously, I consider myself to have recovered a much more actionable, robust, and firm understanding of the person of Jesus Christ (and the things he said and did, and why) than I ever had in the decades leading up to now._

_I'm basically writing this document as a mix of an "impassioned open letter", and "a list of resources and concepts that I wish I'd encountered years earlier in my life."_

_To borrow from James C. Scott's [Against the Grain](), to some of those who I once considered myself to know, and who I once considered to know me, I've revealed myself to be something of a theological barbarian and savage, but I vastly prefer this version of myself than who I was several years ago._

_From my own point of view of myself on my own change, there is a coherent line of thought, way of being, intellectual purity, and a reasonable causal chain from "there" (evangelicalism) to "here" (not evangelicalism, viewing it as one of the primary sources of ongoing harm in the world)._

_To borrow from early church history, I follow 'the way', and reject the label 'christian'._

_What I view as nothing more novel than a process of intellectual and emotional maturation, others view as heresy and an embodiment of evil._

_I find it helpful to describe myself as 'nearly autistic', and I no longer extend graciousness to those who claim to have their entire life built upon an edifice of... something, who then spend more effort clinging to functional illiteracy in order to avoid something that is emotionally uncomfortable._

_There's some esoteric twists and turns. There are no thoughts that are in my head that are particularly novel - at my most novel, any given thought I've had is a combination of ideas contained in at max three books._

_I've been shunned[^shun] by some, and I have withdrawn from others._

  [^shun]: shun (definition): _persistently avoid, ignore, or reject (someone or something) through antipathy or caution._ Where shunning exists, it's a form of punishment that a group can apply to individuals. I was na√Øve and well-intentioned, earlier on in my "journey" out of evangelicalism, and kept expecting others to engage seriously with me, and got met with shunning. "Don't say that!" "Don't think that!" "You can't be serious!" "You might be right, but I don't think others will want to hear about it." "Does that really matter?"

_Eventually, I realized I was seeing many different versions of:_

> _you're thinking incorrect thoughts, Josh, stop acting like this. No, I'm not willing to do any meaningful effort to understand you._

_This response is no longer acceptable to me._

# Who this post is for/who might find this interesting

- If you are not from the united states, this probably won't interest you, though I will be talking about colonialism and imperialism and an attitude of a willingness to dominate, so you're probably affected by what I'm going to discuss.
- If you are from the united states, and don't consider yourself to be religious, and never did consider yourself religious, this probably won't interest you. (Though if you have religious people in your life, this might shed light on some of their dynamics.)
- If you are from the united states, and consider yourself to be religious, this might be your cup of tea.

Critically, this is love letter to an earlier/younger version of myself. 

A way I like to move through the world is to add rungs to the bottom of the ladder, whatever ladder I am on, so if anyone else wants to move up that particular ladder, it is more accessible to them than it was to me.

Some of you might find yourself with a hole in your heart, a sense of emptiness, alienation from otherse and yourself, purposelessness, and a sense of feeling deeply alone, even when with a group of friends, or especially when you're with family. Listen to yourself, attend to your inner state. Together, we might help you rebuild a sense of self, healthy boundaries, and an ability to make your own way through the world. Some of you have been raised in toxic and abusive environments and don't yet even know it. Your soul may have been crushed, repeatedly, until you relented and consented to whatever regime you were under, and you don't even remember it. Lets go get it back.

To those of you that don't give a damn about whatever esoteric and inane going-ons are happening in 'the church' in America, some of this might be interesting, as the language and content will be novel to you. 


# Summary of whats to come

After reading a few books, I obtained a dramatically different view of the religious teachings I was given as a child. I'd been applying the full weight of my intellect to my understanding of religion, myself, my relationships, and the world around me, and kept coming up empty, with something like a 'gaping hole' in my soul. 

These improved conceptual compressions have let me move through the world in a much healthier and more forceful way. I'm dramatically less succeptible to certain unhealthy influences, and feel much more at peace and content. I also, at times, feel _quite_ angry, but I don't deny myself a sense of anger like I used to.

The entire weight of evangelical christianity and it's pomp and circumstance evaporated from my life like popping a balloon. It collapsed so completely that the thought of taking it seriously on it's own terms now feels like the punchline to a joke. 


1. a list of the 'dangerous' books I read.
2. Where I started (evangelicalism and Jesus Christ)
3. Where I ended up (not evangelicalism and Jesus Christ)
4. How I got from there to here

## The Dangerous Books I Read

_Warning: Don't read any of the books I reference in this article. Any single book might wreck you._

I've always been intuitively attracted to lists of banned books. Almost on principle, if I find that a book has been banned, I'll seek it out, read it, and luxuriate in whatever subversive or anti-establishment views it espouses. 

These books that I recommend could easily be banned. Banning a book directly is a small-brained solution to a problem, from the establishment point of view, because of the [Streisand Effect](). 

If the evangelical church got together and said:

> We're banning _The Politics of Jesus_, _The Non-Violent Atonement_, and _The Problem of Political Authority_, everyone who had access to a library, a credit card, or the internet would go out and see what spicy words were contained in the text. Even children. In the era of the internet, the best defense against üå∂Ô∏è ideas is an attitude of apathy. 

Feel free to skim the rest of this article. It's long, meandering, and weaves together my own thoughts with those of the books I read. I've written a few articles already around this topic, and I'll link them in, but if you're at all inclined to read the books I suggest, I think your time would be well-spent, though you'll pay far more for reading these books than just time and money.

A warning - I'm nearly autistic and will wade through text of any difficulty if I feel like there's something useful at the other end. These books are not "easy", but neither is life. Grow up or get out.

Here's the books (and a paper), in the order in which I read them:

- Becoming Anabaptist: The Origin and Significance of Sixteenth-Century Anabaptism
- The Naked Anabaptist
- The Politics of Jesus
- The Non-violent Atonement
- The Hermeneutic of Paul and the Introspective Conscious of the West (an academic paper from the 1950s)

Boom. That was it. At the end of these three books, and the paper, I was firmly outside of the evangelical tradition, and will never able to be brought back. 

It was a small move, because when I _started_ these books, I called myself an evangelical out of convenience in some circles. If others asked, I'd say something like "I'm a christian, but I strongly dislike most of the emotional baggage that comes along with those words."

## Where I started

I was "an evangelical", despite how much I disliked the political conservativism that tends to come with it.[^anarchist]

[^anarchist]: I'm an actual anarchist right now, have been for a while, but that's neither here nor there. Just don't read _The Problem of Political Authority: An Examination of the Right to Coerce and the Duty to Obey_

## Where I ended up

After reading those books, some of them more than once, and much conversation (and painful lack of conversation) with others, I strongly and clearly de-identified with Christianity, christians, and all forms of evangelicalism. 

This article isn't about why I de-identified with evangelicalism, though. I did that quietly, without really telling anyone, and I kept going to church on Sundays, and since I wasn't saying/writing much about what I'd encountered, except for in trusted 1:1 conversations, no one in my family or the church had any reason to think things had changed for me. (Anyone who knew me and this came up in conversation, I'd quickly explain where I'd been, theologically, and they could track with me, but again, in the terms of Exit, Voice, and Loyalty, I exited, quietly. 

**This article is about why I now strongly associate evangelicalism with an active creation of spaces safe for, and full of, abusive behaviors, oppression, and violence. As someone who's ethically opposed to abuse, oppression, and violence... I've got words.**

These books are quite dangerous, in the same way that Jesus was dangerous. For example, here's a "take" that I'd literally never considered, but is intellectually coherent:

> Jesus was not "murdered by God to atone for the sins of mankind" (the satisfaction atonement motif) - he was murdered by angry and small-minded people at the behest of the religious and political leaders, because he represented a credible threat to the established political and religious regimes of the day, and that threat was legible to the people who ran the regimes, so they killed him. No more and no less. 
> 
> To me, it's now vastly more interesting to understand and apprectiate why his words and actions were so egregiously offensive to the establishment. Given that he also encouraged his followers to embody his way of being, if one can see why he was dangerous to the status quo, one becomes different, and... oops. There goes the status quo. 

----------------------------------

Next, after reading the three books above about anabaptism, I kept reading 'the canon', and a deeply interesting paper. 

- The Non-Violent Atonement
- Essays in Honor of J. Denny Weaver
- The Hermeneutic of Paul and the Introspective Conscious of the West (an academic paper from the 1950s)

I was in 'the church', in a variety of 'baptist', 'evangelical', 'southern baptist', 'presbyterian', 'episcopal', non-denominational churches, from age zero, through perhaps age 31. I went to a nominally christian four-year university. 

At the beginning, I went to church because my parents would have committed acts of soul murder upon me if I strenuously resisted going to church, so eager church attendance was simple safety-seeking behavior, and then at a later time, I was fully onboard with churchishness, ostensibly of my own volition. (We did sunday morning church, sunday evening church, wednesday evening church, i think often church on Thursdays, and lots of 'church stuff' at home.)

Kristi and I were married in "the church" over a decade ago, and at that point I considered my involvement to be fully voluntary. 

Then, 2019 happened. these words are that story. 

What happened in 2019?
 
Lets roll back the clock to 2019.

You and I had not even heard the word 'covid 19'. 

I was climbing well, finally getting some breakthroughs in my bouldering and sport climbing. 

The troubles that would affect my life in 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 were completely absent from my consciousness. 

I was happy, all seemed good. 

Friends, family, climbing, I was doing well in my career, doing cool things, giving cool talks at meetups, had a great podcast appearence, and was helping others in ways that were good and emotionally satisfying. 

I was getting unsolicited job offers, got recognized by a stranger in an airport because of a talk I had given (!!!), had external and internal trappings of success. My birth family and Kristi's birth family gave me a resounding 'thumbs up', based on the life I was living. 

Money was abundant, free time was abundant, emotional energy and engagement and agency was overall abundant.

Things were good.


Then 2019 happened. When i try to think of the beginning of the story, the best focal point I can pick is when I read a little book.

I read an unassuming little pamphlet titled Becoming Anabaptist: The Origin and Significance of Sixteenth-Century Anabaptism. It ruined me. Changed the trajectory of my life.

Let me back up a bit. 

Again, this is going to get nuanced, in some ways. 

I'm writing this letter more or less to people who consider themselves to be part of the church, even though for the last three years, I've firmly rejected the moral authority of those people, and without concern or qualm iterated on my beliefs in such a way that people who considered me to have been part of "their team" as an "insider in the church" would now assess me as apostate or heretical. 

I happen to disagree with their read of me. 

These people have simultaneously taken steps to prevent me from explaining myself, thus I don't care anymore about their opinions, but there was a time that this judging (coupled with the shunning) hurt. It was, at minimum, confusing and felt like a form of abandonment. 

"You're saying you dislike me, but we've hardly even talked about the core issues at stake, and when we do talk about it it's just been you pouring condemnation on me? You've not even asked me an open-ended question, you fool."

I happen to consider myself to not be apostate or heretical, and since this is my life and my website, I can share my story. 

When "the shift" first started happening, I didn't really think it would lead to where it actually led me:

- no longer married, and as far as those kinds of things go, it went rather poorly
- No longer on speaking terms with a rather large percentage of my birth family, and with the family I married into
- No longer in any form of relationship with a rather large percentage of a former friend group
- I've deepened dramatically many friendships in my life (new and old), which has provided energy and support in a way that one might find a life preserver to provide energy and support when floating down a turbulent river

I've been functionally expelled from my birth family (though I was never really anything but an outsider in my own family), and I've been expelled from the family I married into, and various friend groups and extended family groups have also indicated that I'm no longer to be fairly/safely engaged with. [^engage-with]

[^engage-with]: the narrative seems to be that I have "expelled myself" from those groups. We can agree to disagree. I endorse [Conflict is Not Abuse: Overstating Harm, Community Responsibility, and the Duty to Repair](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/29363252) as a useful ethical framework for how to proceed. The number of people who have brought aggressive and demanding and probing questions to me, that I've asked to consider reading one or two books to better understand the dynamics at root, who have then plainly refused to read a single book... You don't have to read a book, but if you claim to care deeply what's going on, and then want to engage with me the way a lawyer might cross-examine a witness, and you embody coercive frame control... my time is short, my energy important. take a hike. You've un-earned access to my resources.

At least it feels that way. 



We'll talk about the dynamics of "shunning behavior" as a way of asserting dominance of a group over individuals later, and I've also been in recent times screamingly depressed, physically injured, emotionally wounded, and have withdrawn, at times, from most of the world, so I have hidden. 

So, between me not being proactive in relationships, hiding from the overtures of others, the narrative around 'where I'm at' has been entertaining to watch it evolve. Remember - conflict is not abuse, and the overstatement of harm is a threat. 

> Josh, why are you hiding from the overtures of others?

Some have reached out with a message like 'pull your head out of your ass and man up', which, besides not really meaning anything, earned a quick 'block this contact' response. (If I've not spoken at all or openly to you in several years, I'm not going to dignify a condemning overture with a response.) 

Enough of 'my people' verbally assaulted me when I was already in a pretty low place, so cutting off contact with most people of a certain ilk (evangelical) was safety-seeking behavior on my behalf. 


So, this all started with my brother-in-law's Christmas gift to me. I read a lot*, and every Christmas and birthday, tend to be given at least a few books. (Thank you, everyone who's ever gotten me a book!) 

*I sometimes over-intellectualize things. It's a trauma response. I seek safety in books, intellectual frameworks, improved conceptual compressions of the world. I often do gain incremental improvements in safety and peace, but there's a point of diminishing returns. There's a right amount of book reading, and an excessive amount of book reading. I don't know where I am within this, but I've read dramatically fewer books-per-year lately than I used to.

Someone will gift me a kindle book, and I'll read it at some point. I really love this tradition.

There was this book that is even today, screamingly boring. I barely made it through. It's an academic text about the history of an obscure group of people in the 16th century. My brother-in-law bought me the book, because the group had come up in conversation, and he thought it might be interesting to me. 

He was right. It wrecked me.

I opened it up on my kindle, and started the preface, and was rocked. So much so that I copied the text down, and made this little blog post about it: https://josh.works/whats-up-with-anabaptists

That was the beginning of the end. 

The preface of the book was excellent, and then the last chapter and appendix was also exceptional. I touch on all of those things in the blog post. 

At the time, I knew nothing about the anabaptists. I didn't realize that they were targeted for extermination/ethnic cleansing by the religious and secular authorities of the day. 

Critically, I felt a sense of indignation that no one had told me that the same John Calvin that shaped much of modern protestantism had also advocated for genocide against this group. 

The modern take on Anabaptists often says it's a disagreement about minor theological points, like 'how many times is the right number of times to be baptized' and 'who, really, is allowed to interpret scripture.'

The book said, basically, "when one group is killing [literally, burning at the stake] another group, perhaps we in the modern world should assume that both sides of the party knew what was at stake (pun intended), instead of saying they were committing acts of ethnic cleansing over a misunderstanding." 

Next, any earnest effort to get to the bottom of the disagreement should focus on the core differences between the groups, rather than over-focusing on commonalities. 

This last sentence ruined me.

I kept finding this conversational tactic around me everywhere, for the next two years of my life. I would want to focus conversations on core, critical differences, and those around me would respond with "sure, but look at the things you agree about each other, surely that difference you say is critical is immaterial. Anyway, what's for lunch?"

So, that book kicked off my normal 'reading of the canon'. 

(The best/worst thing about being 'hyper literate', and having used reading as a dissociative activity much of my life is a stack of books one or two feet tall doesn't intimidate me in the slightest, as long as they're all in english.)

I ordered another five or six books on the topic from Amazon, and read through them all. 

I ended up reading _The Politics of Jesus_, and... that was it. That was the end. That was when I officially renounced vestiges of evangelicalism, and decided I might never attend a church again. I didn't stop going to church when I read it, but I instantly felt like an outsider. 

I began feeling uncomfortable with the songs that were sung, the constant repeating of certain 'creeds', and more. 

After reading The Politics of Jesus, I shared some personal context, a summary of the introduction, and reproduced a few pages from the first chapter here: https://josh.works/was-jesus-ethics-normative.

Yoder, the author of The Politics of Jesus, in the first chapter, eviscerated "the church" (really, any vestige of Christendom) by showing the ways that modern biblical ethicists (of which pastors and clergy are a sub-group) explicitly teach that the things Jesus said and did are irrelevant in modern times, and must be discarded.

At this point in the story, I'd encourage you to click through the above link, and read it. It'll take a while. I'll wait. 

üëâ https://josh.works/was-jesus-ethics-normative

if you're not 'in the church', you might not recognize that the page slug, 'was Jesus' ethic normative', is an absolute broadside against 'the church'. to write those words is to throw an actual bomb into a room.

I kept trying to get friends to read this book. 

Some did, and found it as compelling as I did. 

Some of you looked at it, saw that it was loosely academic and had a lot of footnotes, and chose to embrace functional illiteracy.

The author of the book (John Yoder) makes a *ahem* compelling case that 

> the Jesus that is preached about in churches across America is explicitly made irrelevant to today, and replaced with basically an ethic of intellectual naturalism. 

This is fine - if you wanna believe in intellectual naturalism, IDGAF, but don't also then try to tell me it's's rooted in the story of Jesus Christ.

The  book makes a great point - to all the people showing up to the execution of the person known as Jesus, most of them recognized him as nothing more interesting then a legitimate threat to the established order of the church and the state, because of the things that he said and did. He was a politically dangerous person, and the powers that be do what they've always done - maneuvered the world to eliminate a threat. Plain and simple.

### Justification

If you go to a church, they'll talk about 'the atonement', which is broadly addressed anytime you hear about "the work Jesus did on the cross" or "being saved by the blood of christ", or "forgiveness of your sins", and more. It's kinda the core tenant of christianity. 

You'll hear the text "justified by faith". Briefly, Yoder argues that this could be better understood. First, "justified" doesn't mean "forgiven", it is to be understood in the word-document text-formatting way. To "justify" a block of text is to align the ends of the lines. Ruby (the programming language) has methods like `rjust` and `ljust`, short of "right justify" and "left justify". It adds padding to strings to make them line up. 

The "justification" of which this text speaks is to be "rightly aligned" relative to others. Do you have conflict between you and someone else? Then you're not "rightly aligned" to each other. To be "rightly aligned" would be akin to resolving and repairing the block.

so lets the first word of "justified by faith" to "rightly aligned to others". By what? How do we get rightly aligned?

"by faith...fulness" 

Faithfulness? What does that mean? 

You can be "faithful" to a creed, an ethic, a set of norms. The faithfulness being referenced is faithfulness to Jesus' specific social ethic, in which he talked a lot about interpersonal relations, within groups, across groups, and across power differentials.

So "justified by faith" becomes "rightly aligned to others by faithfulness to Jesus'' specific social ethic."

Some of you might not realize that making this assertion takes me into the realm of herasy. Live on the edge, huh?

### Romans 13

My journey was still unfolding. I didn't realize I was moving into the 'outer darkness' relative to my religious community. I was just following interesting threads. Printing out papers, reading reading reading. I was as happy as a... happy thing. 

Romans 13 is this big text that's referenced today to explain why 'good people' are supposed to do what the secular authorities tell them to do. the interpretation goes something like this:

"the state, and it's self-claimed legal monopoly on violence, is ordained by God to be over us, because the world runs on authority and domination, and the state is something like our intellectual father, just as the heavenly father is over us, so we should obey it."

I want to scare quote nearly every word in that statement, but here's how Yoder re-works that statement:

"The state, to the degree that it cares well for the least-privileged person under it's 'dominion' , has legitimacy to care well for those persons."

Oops. Heresy part two. Did you feel it? 

There are plenty more bombs carefully contained in that text. I'd encourage you to read it. These two examples serve as sufficient explanation. 

Modern evangelicalsm is... well, basically politically powerful white people coopting language of moral authority to justify a regime of domination. This is all in the context of Americanism, or westernism. The intellectual throught that emerged in Europe after the advent of the printing press, related to Calvin, Luther, catholicism, and more, is basically all the same. 


## The non-violent atonement

OK, so we're gonna go another layer deeper. Here's why:

It would be one thing to throw your hands up, say "yep, the church is effed up, not gonna touch it with a ten-foot pole", and walk away and never come back. 

Nothing wrong with that. 

It's like walking away from white supremacy. You don't need to prove to the white supremacists, as they cling to their white supremacy, that they're wrong. It's sorta de-dignifying to debate them from their own 'frame', because the frame makes so many assumptions that it cannot really be wrestled with fairly. They'll "no true scottsman" you to death.

In fact, refusal to leave a certain frame and try on a different one is a tactic of abuse. It's a blatant refusal to adopt the theory of mind of someone else. Of course they're right, if you play by their rules, because their starting assumption of the world is that 'the white race' is superior, and non-white races are inferior. If they say "prove to me that non-white people are not inferior", it's embarrassing and self-abandoning to even treat that statement with seriousness. 

More on frame control: https://knowingless.com/2021/11/27/frame-control/

Undoubtedly you're better off, leaving this whole pile of crock behind, and nothing meaningful is lost. It's like walking away from a cult, or deciding that your friends who think the earth is flat are wrong. All you 'lose' is a mental model that causes the world to keep not making sense, and getting mysteriously lost when navigating by the stars. 

You can change your thinking and leave an intellectually bankrupt idea behind, and having nothing but improvement, and there's no need to engage intellectually with those you leave.

unless, of course, you think you might be able to get more of them to leave with you.

I've always enjoyed a good house party, and any good party is more fun when there's more people. So, in honor of me 'leaving evangelicalism', I'm sorta throwing myself a party, and trying to get a few more people to show up. 

I'm basically willing to do to evangelicals what they so annoyingly do to others. I'm evangelizing them. (ooooh, how your blood might be boiling right now, dear reader, if you're an evangelical and pissed with me.)

Buuuut the best/worst thing about me is I'm *so screamingly stupid* I can only take baby steps from one spot to another, and I like to leave a trail of breadcrumbs behind me. 

I can start at one spot and end up at a starkly different spot that is very surprising to someone else, but something that I love about myself is that nothing I've ever done is difficult or undoable by someone else. 

So, if I've arrived at a 'theologically novel spot', my honor requires me to push back and say "this is neither novel, nor difficult for you to arrive at, if you're willing to apply a little brain sweat". 

# Appendix

Please, please engage with this, if you have any inclination. 

My email inbox is open, and I'd be thrilled to hop on a whatsapp call to discuss more! (Whatsapp is preferred to phone call, for a few reasons, but I could be swayed to do a phone call.)

Just a warning, though - there's this thread of coercion and domination that exists in the church, and when someone tries to invoke a claim of "authority" over me, I have to laugh inside a little. Here's why:

I've been so brutalized by authority my whole life, and I've seen what happens to others when they have been brutalized by 'authority', i've had an instinct to rebel, on principle, when someone tries to force me to do something. 

I comply with police, nominally, because they could kill me (but I'm a privileged white-passing wealthy guy, so I'm unlikely to ever have an actual-bad interaction with police.)

Short of that, I have something that could be called "the opposite of respect" for those who invoke claims of authority. It now lands as an intellectual crutch, the tools of those who don't have the awareness or maturity to use adult tools. Authority is for children. Don't threaten me like I am an easy-to-intimidate child. 

I've got good books that I could refer one to, if you wanted to know why I so reject your claims of authority, and why I would advise your children to stop giving it any heed, as soon as they're out of the range of your threats of physical and emotional violence.

I'm not here really for the people that want to argue. I'm here for the people like me, that when they smelled the possibility of an alternative they jumped on it. I heard rumblings on the distance of ideas contained in books, and ordered them and read them immediately. I hungered and thirsted for knowledge and wisdom, and true to my form, read about 1000 pages in pursuit of knowledge and freedom.

I found it. I'm out. The books are there for anyone else to read. The path has been laid. 

The entire edifice of Christendom just... collapses. The screaming rage of evangelicalism dies with a wimper, in a heap. 

I kept going to friends in the church with my findings, and they kept matching my eager interest with derision, disinterest, and dismissiveness. I can't control others, but I was and am willing to *ahem* burn any bridge required to protect myself, and those that I love, from abusive institutions. 

I have a vast capacity to love. I am deeply compassionate. I dislike conflict to my core, and in the same way as some will go off to war to commit acts of violence against, broadly, another ethnic group, I will strenuously exert myself to reduce conflict for myself and those I love. One of the ways one can resist actual violence is with words. 

Violence is a terrible problem-solving solution. It invariably creates problems, as it's contingent upon fear, intimidation

My main mechanism of reducing conflict now is not violence. 

It's to grow the awareness, skills, capacity, and strength of those who are being victimized by those willing to use violence, or who complacency, privilege, and unawareness allow bad things to keep happening. 

So, if you read the books mentioned above, you'll join me on the outside of evangelicalism. Despite what your parents may have told you, there's a lot of fun to be had out here, and freedom. Dramatically less shame. a bit of laughter. things don't need to be so serious all the time. We have potlucks, home-cooked meals, mutuality, and co-creation. 

When someone is sad, we hold space for them. When they're stuck, we help un-stick them. When someone has a sense of malaise, we malaise with them. We don't arbitrarily denigrate whole groups of people (sigh. My weakness in this regard is to denigrate evangelicals, white supremacists, and imperialists/colonialists, and yes, I know that hurt people hurt people. It's been a year or so since I've exited the world I was raised in for three decades. Working on it.)

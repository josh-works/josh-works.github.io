I'm digging into Elixir and Phoenix. I'm working through [this tutorial to cloning Slack](https://medium.com/@benhansen/lets-build-a-slack-clone-with-elixir-phoenix-and-react-part-1-project-setup-3252ae780a1).

The tutorial author says

> At the time of writing, I have ~1 week experience with Phoenix. Similar to [Rubber Ducky Debugging](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Rubber_duck_debugging), I am writing this blog post to force myself to think differently about the problems I am solving and therefore gain a better understanding of the language and framework.

Couldn't agree more myself. This post serves as *my* Rubber Ducky Debugging process for getting started with Elixir/Phoenix.

Similar to the author, I come from a Ruby/Rails background, but undoubtedly less experienced than the author. So, this article will capture tidbits and pieces useful to me as I work through the tutorial.

I'm [intentional in how I learn]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-06-04-learning-how-to-learn.md %}), as well as in [how I ask questions]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-05-29-ask-better-questions.md %}), so this is just me, doing what I do, to learn things.

Onward!

# Installing Elixir and Phoenix

Installation is super easy.

The recommended tutorials + some clicking around was all I needed. Brew handled most of it, and [elixir-lang's installation guide](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) pairs well with [the same for phoenix](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html)

I just `cd`'ed into `workspace/elixir` (where my otherwise homeless bits of code lives) and test-drove Phoenix's equivalent of `rails new`.

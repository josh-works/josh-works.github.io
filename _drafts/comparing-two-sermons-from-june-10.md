I listened to two sermons on June 10th. 

This was the first Sunday after the interesting events at the capital building Washington DC, in the USA. 

# Calvary Church in Golden, CO

# Grace Anglican Church in Grove City, PA

Hi Pastor Tim,

I just listened to your update (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVCKQEGAGmw&feature=youtu.be) that you sent out a few days ago.

You alluded to the fact that your sermon stirred up some feelings, and some persons have communicated those feelings to you.

My guess is that you got positive and negative feedback, and of course I imagine stuff in the middle.

Josh Thompson's bio:
Josh Thompson writes words for people and computers. 

Before getting into software development, he worked in:

- climbing gyms
- customer support
- customer success
- Inbound B2B SaaS sales 

He likes how he gets to use all of this prior experience in the teams he works with and the problems he solves.

Things to discuss:
- Bringing engineering and "the business" closer together
- Bringing personal success and growth in-line with business success and growth
- The under-utilized opportunity of teams developing the skills of their own members
- Software as a _mindset_ vs software as an end goal
- The role of emotions and trust in learning. One's emotional state, and trust in the instructor/institution/process is paramount. 
- Using power differentials for explicit good  instead of anything else
- Power. What it looks like. What it is. How it can be used. Why the tech industry (and _everyone_ within it) has power, especially those who think they don't have it. 

(If it's helpful, I could share things I've written that touch on some of these items)

My super power: I can teach nearly anything I know, to almost anyone. I take an "expansive" view of many skills, "technical" and otherwise. When I learn something new, I can "compress" the new knowledge into something that others can learn in a fraction of the time, with a fraction of the effort.

I did some early honing of this skill at the largest climbing gym on the east coast in ~2011-2012. I got to teach a difficult and dangerous skill to people who often felt a reasonable and near-crippling fear response when dealing with the material.

I read many books in 2018. I'm listing them out here, along with recommendations. Here's the recommendation "key":

- üëç = I recommend this book. (This metric is intentionally fuzzy.)
- üòî = This book influenced my mental model of the world/reality/myself
- üè¢ = Book topic is architecture and/or urbanism
- üíµ = Book topic is finance/economics/politics
- üò´ = This book is hard to get through. Lengthy and/or academic
- üê≤ = Fiction (most of the fiction I read had fantastic(al) creatures in them, hence the dragon)


(I did this last year as well: [Recommended books from 2017]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2018-01-15-2017_books.md %} ))

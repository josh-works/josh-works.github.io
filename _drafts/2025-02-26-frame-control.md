## Introduction 

I've long wanted to have a definitive place where I can explain why I keep thinking of/referencing this thing I call, others call, 'frame control'. 

It's tricky. When it's being experienced unpleasently, it often-enough mimics tactics of verbal abuse and emotional neglect. 

Some people unintentionally 'use' frame control to try to achieve a certain outcome on a certain topic. It's 'just' slightly coercive conversation, at it's lightest, maybe.

Others, the true masters of frame control, use frame control to deftly verbally box and bully the victim into some intellectual position, constraining them emotionally as directly as leg shackles constrain someone's physical movement. 

More I can say, for now, I suggest reading the canonical piece:

ðŸ‘‰ [https://knowingless.com/2021/11/27/frame-control/](https://knowingless.com/2021/11/27/frame-control/)

It's worth reading in it's entirety. My childhood experience of a father figure was similar to the same for the author. I long ago stopped interacting with him, and a few times recently happened to use words to communicate with him, and could 'clock' the tactics so directly and easily this time.

The conversations were short and unproductive, which is fine, _I didn't get hurt_, which I cannot say for the 5, 8, 12 yeard old versions of me who spent hours, days, years in the presence of someone like this. 

The 'not frame control' response to this would be a conversational style informed by something like:


- frame "choosing and using", instead of frame controlling
- frame 'following'
- frame 'checking' 
- conversational mutuality

i keep noticing when I talk with evangelicals about 'their' things, I can make a concession and 'put on' their frame, which is something that they act entitled to. I can then express everything I want to express from the POV of their frame, but since it's non-conforming, I then get shunned. 

But never-not-once have they expressed a willingness to try out, or even recognize, that there might be a different 'frame' on the same issue, and globally useful/good/agreeable actions will probably pass mustard in all frames.

Sometimes one issue is seen as 'complex' inside of one frame, but might seem different in useful ways seen through a different frame.

To me, once I learned to dual wield 'the concept of frame control _at all_' and 'there are many possible/useful frames, and i dislike not using this to our collective advantage'.

## Why pushy frame control is hurtful

in theory, people exchange words to share and learn useful things about each other. if, in talking to my evangelical father about why hitting kids is wrong, he says "well the bible says clearly ...." and he gets pouty and mean when I reference _any alternative framing of the situation_, he's using frame control, and trying to force me to either stay in 'his' frame, where he feels safer, or he wants me to stop talking about it.

Of course, at this point it's obvious that a collaborative outcome isn't in the cards, so even if I willingly adopt his frame, he just will keep trying to verbally/emotionally beat me into submission, using ever more narrow slices of his frame.

Once one is willing to look at the shape of a conversation to see if it feels like the other person is being collaborative, or aiming to evade and dominate, it becomes _very tiring_ to be in the latter kind of conversation. 

The frame controller is trying to prevent new information from impacting their way of viewing things

## On Verbal Abuse vs. Emotional Abuse



## Related Reading

Verbal abuse and emotional abuse are, in my mind, basically the same thing. Words said and unsaid convey the underlying emotional state. Words given with a harsh tone and rolled eyes are so much more than just the words. It's a whole emotional thing. 

Parents use emotional abuse (and emotional neglect) to achieve whatever they want from their kids all the time. That's why the following book is so powerful as a parenting book. The frame of 'power over' vs 'mutual power' is everything. 

- [The Verbally Abusive Relationship](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/402366.The_Verbally_Abusive_Relationship?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_33) "coercive frame control" is another lense of certain tactics of verbal (or really emotional) abuse. If an abuser can achieve their desires to exert power over the other via words, or really, emotions, that might be the most efficient/most learned form of abuse.

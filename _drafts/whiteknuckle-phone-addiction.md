I dont know how to define a smartphone addition. I bet the DSM-{current_version} has a set of criteria that make it possible to diagnose just such an addition, but I'm comfortable with:

> It's hard to concretely define, but easy to recognize when you see it

On top of that, there are plenty of folks who are _not_ addicted to their smart phones, but might self-identify as "wishing to spend a little less time on their phone."

I don't think smart phones are the bane of this generation, and I'll go to the mat defending these "smart-phone addicted people", and how in many cases they might not be addicted, or their particular form of escapism may be less harmful than alcohol abuse, or how a decline of IRL interactions with people makes the phone seem more appealing, etc.

But whatever. In this post, I want to capture some of my notes on how I enticed myself to spend much less time on my phone.

W're going to talk about:

- why bother using your phone less in the first place
- the futility of exercising self-control
- how to determine your current phone usage
- why 'using your phone less' is missing the mark, but why 'making it boring' is on point.

# Why use your phone less

If you find yourself regularly reading the Bible, go read [12 Ways Your Phone is Changing You](). When I first encountered it, I was deeply skeptical of the premis of the book. I expected it to be written as a reaction against all the smart phone usage we see around us every day, and a cry to return "to the good ol' days" (which, frankly, never existed, but I digress).

It is better than that. Much better than that.

If you're not one to read the Bible, go read [Deep Work]() or [Meditations by Marcus Aurilious]().

Here's some reasons you may want to be on your phone less:

**Our phones help us escape discomfort** Uncomfortable social situations, sure, but also uncomfortable situations when we're alone, by ourselves.

Time alone, in your own head, can rightfully be deeply uncomfortable. I posit that addressing this discomfort head-on is better than papering it over with digital distractions.

**Our phones help us escape boredom** Discomfort is "bad", but we're obviously expected to never be bored. Boredom can be good. Interesting things come from boredom. [link to resource about why boredom is good]().

If you reframe your view of boredom from something to avoid to something to pursue, this whole smartphone addition thing becomes much more manageable.

**Our phones keep us from actual focus** Focus is sustained mental effort on something that is hard. The ability to maintain mental focus over extended time is a bit of a super power these days. [Deep work]() makes this point abundantly clear.

So, if you're aiming to improve your career, the best way to do this is with sustained mental effort.

**Our phones keep us from rest** How often do you see someone watching a tv show or a movie, and also doing something on their phone. It looks like they are resting (and they probably think they are resting) but there is no way their brains are getting refreshed.

**Our phones feed the beast** Whenever you're using a free tool, you are the product of that platform, not the user. Platforms online want your clicks, swipes, taps, and eyeballs, and skillfully repackage all of these "impressions" to re-sell to others.

Does that annoy you? Great. Get off the platform.

**Our phones will probably play a sadly prominent role in our children's lives** I don't have kids, but when I do, I fear them remembering me always having a phone out. I fear myself always having a phone out. I don't want my children to expect that when they talk to me, I'll be looking at my phone and listening to them with a fraction of my attention and interest.

Now is when you might think

> Yeah! I agree! This is all true! I'm going to start using my phone less _right now_!

Don't do that. You're bound to fail. You're at a motivational peak right now, and when you're in a motivational trough (which could happen ten minutes from now, tomorrow, or in a month) you'll immediatly go to using your phone as much as before, you'll just feel guilty about it.

_Don't rely on self control_

## Self-control is an abysmal strategy

Any system that requires _regular_ use of self-control is bound to fail. Self-control is an extremely finite resource, and it's not worth battling a habit with self-control. You might win for a while, and then you'll lose again when you're tired, or hungry, or anxious, or emotionally/mentally compromised in _any_ way.

So, in my mind, if I am trying to make a change to how I live my life, and think it will depend upon my own will-power, I've failed to properly implement the change. _I do not rely on my own willpower, because it is quite unreliable_.

So, how do you change phone habits without using self control?

It's easy, and requires three steps:

1. Decide firmly why you want to use your phone less (we already did this part above)
2. Determine how much you actually use your phone
3. Make your phone so boring that even when you're bored, it doesn't have much to offer.


# Determine your current phone usage

If you're serious about this process, you might have just given yourself some books to read. (Remember? [12 ways your phone is changing you] or [deep work]?)

So, don't rush into silver-bullet solutions. If you're intent about reducing your phone usage, you should be willing to ease into it.

So, install an app that tracks your phone usage, and check it out every few days. I'm on Android, and use [phone app](). I'm most interested in the number of "quick checks", and how much time I spend on distracting apps. I don't have twitter or Instagram or Reddit or Feedly (or any app that has endless scroll) on my phone, but thats because when I did, I was devastated by how much time I'd pour into those stupid apps.

Now, let it run in the background and collect data for a week or two. Only then do you have enough of an idea of if you'd like to change your habits or not.

[screenshots of app here]

again, install [android version] for Android, [iphone version] for iPhone. Run it for a week or two. Only then should you move to this last step.

# Make your phone boring

We've established that using _willpower and self-control_ to reduce your phone usage is a poor strategy. By this point you should be installing the "track my usage" apps, and are reading on just for ideas. If you install an app that tracks your usage, and _simultaneously_ reduce your phone usage, you'll get inaccurate data on your own usage, understate the severity of the problem, and abandon the whole thing in a week or two.

So, again, to reduce your usage you need to make your phone a less interesting place to be. For many of us, we lead such anxious, stressed, busy lives and have so little control over ourselves and our environment, our phones are a means of escape. I think instagram is healthier than alcoholism, so if that is your spot, don't just swap out one panacea (phone usage) with another panacea (drinking, TV, any other form of escapism.})

This is a process. Don't go cold turkey and delete all your distracting apps. First, just sprinkle some friction into your phone usage.

In no particular order, here are some ideas:

- Turn off your "easy login" options for your phone. Disable the fingerprint sensor, or face ID, and make your pin or password at least six characters. I kid you not, but this will make you slower to fire your phone up all the time.
- Turn off notifications, both on the lock screen, and anywhere else, for most apps. (except, perhaps email. More on this below)



Why leave email notifications on?

When I was job hunting, I spent a lot of time sending emails and waiting on responses. I'd disabled email notifications at the time, and found myself opening up my email app regularly, to see if there was new email.

So, I re-enabled notifications, so I wouldn't have to see if there were new emails or not. Now I know when I get new email.

(I aggressively unsubscribe from everything, so I only get a handful of new emails a day. I've cleaned out subscriptions to newsletters and such.)

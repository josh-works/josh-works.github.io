title: Lessons and Observations from learning from Experts
---

In early 2020, I had an idea to help improve my own understanding of software development, and figured that if I did it right, I could help many others grow their skills as well.

Here was the root of my problem. I felt like I was moving along the wrong line of this chart. Guess which one is "The wrong line"

I once spent 20 hours trying to learn some tricky Nokogiri selector usage. I wanted to do a simple thing, it took forever to figure it out. 

This was basically my experience:

It took me 20 hours to learn a little. I figured that with the right resource, I could have learned in 4 hours more than I knew at 20 hours.

So I set out to build the resource. And, of course, when we figure out how to teach something, we learn the thing we're teaching even better:

So, with the right tool, these red bars are what someone else will experience, trying to learn the same thing I did:

Notice that the "learning units per hour" is double what mine was. I spent more _total hours_ learning, and my _total knowledge learned_ will be higher than this person, but they will be able to learn _almost_ as much as I know in 1/3rd the time it took _me_ to learn it.

In other words, _with the same time investment, under the right conditions, this person would have learned 3x what I learned_. 

[this is the training resource I built to help others learn Nokogiri way faster than I did](https://github.com/josh-works/intermediate_ruby_obstacle_course/tree/master/nokogiri)

It's _effortful_. Learning this stuff doesn't become pleasent and easy like watching a TED talk. 

But this resource is, hands-down, the best way to learn Nokogiri selectors in Ruby. And you can work through it in an hour or two. 

I'm figuring out how to more effectively share expert knowledge among practitioners.

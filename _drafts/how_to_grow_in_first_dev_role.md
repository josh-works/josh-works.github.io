I started my _first real software development role_ almost six months ago. (November 27th)

This is tremendously exciting, of course, but introduces its own set of challenges, like:

> I finished Turing and I've got a job! Oh snap. I just finished a grueling program, and my reward is I'm fit to sit at the same table with people who are _way smarter than me_.

> I have to learn a whole new codebase. Or four.

> I have to meet the standards of an inexperienced-but-competent professional, not an eager student.

So, I've been thinking _a lot_ about to grow as a developer in my job.

I hope some of the following is helpful to you, if you find yourself in a similar spot. (Given how many fantastic developers are graduating from Turing every six months, the number of smart, driven individuals who are in their first dev job grows by 40+ people/month)

Here are some constraints I'm working with:

- I work on a 100% distributed team of developers, but most of the rest of the offices works in-office in Pittsburgh. (Project Management, Product Management, rest of engineering/qa/devops teams, support, etc).
- My immediate team is a group of 4. Myself and one other dev started about six months ago.
- The other two developers have been on the team for about three years.
- The individual who built most of the application is no longer on the team
- other individual who wrote the application is pulled between three products and over a dozen direct reports
- there is an extreme level of trust passed to all on the team. No one is required to pair with me, or checks in with me every day to make sure I've committed X code or fixed Y bugs.

The above list might cause the applicability of the following to drop, or it might cause it to be even more helpful.

These constraints are challenges, indeed. In some ways, it might be easier to waltz into a company that has a robust mentoring program, and batch-hires new developers so everyone is passing through the mentorship pipeline with a buddy.

Sure, that would be cool. But then I'd miss out on opportunities like:

- figuring out how to set up an environment where I am growing in my technical skills
- wrestle with the challenges of setting up a program like this
- learn common failure paths, and success paths, of a program like this. Someday I hope to be able to guide new developers through their first job. This is good learning.

# What is the range of options available to me?

A simplistic solution could be to go look at some company who has an established mentorship program, and try to force-fit it into our team of four. If said plan called for 15 hours a week of pairing, I could ask each of the three developers how they felt about pairing with me for five hours a week, each.

That's almost a workday out of each week that would be lost to pairing. It feels like a big ask.

```
read other common mentorship programs
find justification for time commitment?
see if I can get one half-day a week from each person on team? where we'll be explicitly pairing?
Run above as an experiment, two sessions per person total?

---------------
pair above with side-projects explicitly related to work?
pair above with ruby videos?
```


We're also 100% remote, so anytime the internet dropped many packets, there would be lag and friction.

All of this is balanced out against the need (for the benefit of the company) for me to get up and fully effective as quickly as possible.

Me: Sport climber, decade+, of and on a few different times over the years. 

Educate myself, train as effectively and safely as I can. I'm 30, and wanna hit some significant climbing goals by 40, and a big part of that is getting stronger, safely, while not getting injured. 

I'm also running a high-elevation marathon (Leadville Marathon) this summer, and would love to see if there's any intersection of running and BFR.

I'm also on the road a lot, with limited access to "standard" training tools. I'll travel with the Tension hangboard, and just got a block so I can work w/1-arm hangs, and its a bit smaller. 



Attendees: 
- Nate just moved to CO, climbing since 2013
- Johan 53, from Norway/Sweden, sport climber 
- Brad (Butora), head coach in Atlanta or something. 
- Brent, 5 years, boulderer. 


Aerobic capacity improvements via BFR

---------------------

Improved strength

Lower-extremity workouts, etc

What's the goal of strength coach, rehab specialist

Improve facets of athleticism through general/specific exercise. 

High motor unit recruitment at sub-maximal load.
- no need to go to 100% max load to get full recruitment. (yay)
- efficiently clear out metabolic waste

### Hormonal response: 

HGH improves by a lot
MTOR pathway
Vascular something or another
Testosterone improved

All without really high intensity. 

### How does the body respond to exercise stress?

1. we "fatigue" muscles, and signales associated with "fatigue" induce local/systemic response that allow motor units to improve their ability to sustain the exercise
2. "fatigue" is felt when "homeostasis" in the working tissue is "disturbed"
3. the "disturbance" is caused by severe hypoxia and decrease in intracellular phosphate stores (ATP/PC - phospho-creatine)
4. Protein synthesis is upreguated in all active tissues. 

## Energy sytems

- Phosphagen, 10 seconds before expended - Anaerobic
- Glycolytic: energy system that BFR works, 20-60 seconds of use [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_glycolysis) Anaerobic
- Oxidative: aerobic, sustainable, aerobic




### To Anki

- Proximal/proximally, distal/distally
- angiogenic effect
- endothelial health
- HGH
- phosphate, intercellular phosphate stores
- ATP is required for muscle contraction AND relaxation 

### How to explain BFR to parents

- Climbing is a strength _and_ skill sport. 
- To improve at climbing, you can become more skilled, and/or you can become "stronger"
- There's some "standard" ways that people get "stronger":
  - Neural adaptations
  - Physiological adaptations (muscle size and "efficiency")
    - aerobic
    - anaerobic adaptation
    
    - you can force anaerobic adaptations by creating a mis-match in "fuel" availability
    
    Results of this mismatch:
    - hormonal response
    - general muscular strength adaptations
    - recovery adaptations, clear out metabolic waste quicker, so I can recover more efficiently. 
  

Heavy loading w/BFR:
- 3x10 @ 70-90% 1RM
- 2-3 min rest between sets
- 5-6 exercises, 2-3 days/wk
- neural response first

BFRT
- 3x30 @ 20-50% 1rm
- 20-30 s rest between sets
- 4-5 exercises, 20-25 min
- 2-3 days/wk, or daily
- hypertrophic response first

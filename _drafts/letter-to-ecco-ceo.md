My wife and I just _almost_ had a fight over shoes, because I'd found [these Ecco shoes](https://us.ecco.com/ecco-collin-2.0-sneaker-536274.html?dwvar_536274_color=52664&dwvar_536274_size=39) months ago, wanted to order them, and they were out of my size. 

_Back then, there was no way to say 'notify me when this item is in stock'_

So, I forgot about it. Then, my wife and I ordered some clothes for me from H&M, and just had _another long miserable conversation_ because we had to re-make ALL THE SAME DECISIONS WE'D MADE THAT LED US TO CHOOSE YOUR SHOE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

Now I've spent 40 minutes of my Sunday, dealing with fallout from not knowing when these shoes will be available.

My minor inconvenience might easily represent you losing out an an extra 1% of sales/year, or an extra $13 million USD.

I could fix this problem for you for $130,000. 

How'd I arrive at this price?

From your [2018 annual report](http://media.ecco.com/GroupCommunication/ECCO-Annual-Report-2018/#/) shows 

Your opening of the Annual Report states:

> Entrepreneurship is deeply rooted in the ECCO culture... but we no longer have the agility of a start-up. 

That said, you see innovation across a number of portions of your business. 

_Only some of those portions are related to your e-commerce and omni-channel options for consumers._

Your mission is brilliant. 

I can help your company add at least 1.5% to your bottom line, which is $15 million dollars, by adding a small button to your website that says "notify me when this product is available in this size"

Send them an email with a link when the product comes into stock. 

It will look like this:

![h&m example](https://p64.f2.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/5zuXgmLx/Screen%20Recording%202020-05-31%20at%2007.48%20PM.gif?v=df86705d6cfb137e93fbdc3234b035fa)

------------------------------------

# Update

As I've looked more at your company over these last few minutes, I grow increasingly interested in seeing you succeed in the world! I'd rather your company grow by 20% next year than Nike, for instance. 

I think this proposal, and the ways we'd use it to build trust between you and your customers, would lead to substantial growth in your business, and represent an opportunity to draw a meaningful differentiator between you and the faceless, souless, giant American shoe companies. 

I don't want to do this feature in a way that just works, and helps get you an extra 2% revenue in shoe sales from men who dislike shoe-shopping so much that they just want the damn shoe whenever it's available. 

That's what I planned when I opened started this document.

What I've planned now is to build this feature for you in such a way that you convert almost every single person who asks to be notified about product availability into a life-long buyer of your shoes.

Building this trust with customers will be hard. 

It's relatively easy to add the `email notifications when certain size is in stock` piece.

Building trust with customers? That is harder.

I'm uniquely situated to solve this problem on all of the many domains it crosses paths with. 

----------------------

Again, here's what I'd love to see Ecco add to their website:

![h&m](https://p64.f2.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/5zuXgmLx/Screen%20Recording%202020-05-31%20at%2007.48%20PM.gif?v=df86705d6cfb137e93fbdc3234b035fa)

That is from [Slim Fit Easy-iron Shirt](https://www2.hm.com/en_us/productpage.0781758003.html). 

I can do this fix, but it's a lot of money, and you need to make sure that you, me, _and your entire team_ are completely aligned.

I'd love to chat more about this. I charge $10,000 for a roadmapping session.

Roadmapping sessions:
- Take place under an NDA
- where we'd schedule calls over a day (or meet in person, depending on when we get this scheduled)
- allow detailed exploration of the problem, in a question and answer format, and I'll find _exactly_ what the work is that needs to be done to deliver the most value to your business. 
- concludes with a detailed write-up of what fixes need to be implemented

With that write-up, you can either pay me for the fixes, or hand it off to your own development team, to have them do the work. 

I do hope to set this up. 

Before roadmapping, I'd want to schedule a 60-minute call to even see if this roadmapping session would make sense, for $250. You can schedule that here: 

[https://calendly.com/joshthompson/ecco-intake-call](https://calendly.com/joshthompson/ecco-intake-call)

After this call, you will be able to decide if the full roadmapping session is a reasonable next step.

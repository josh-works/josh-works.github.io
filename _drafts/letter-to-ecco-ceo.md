please fix site.

My wife and I just had almost a fight over shoes, because I'd found [these shoes](https://us.ecco.com/ecco-collin-2.0-sneaker-536274.html?dwvar_536274_color=52664&dwvar_536274_size=39) months ago,wanted to order them, and they were out of my size. 

_there was no way to say 'notify me when this item is in stock via email'_

So, I forgot about it. Then, my wife and I ordered some clothes for me from H&M, and just had _another long miserable conversation_ because we had to re-make ALL THE SAME DECISIONS WE'D MADE THAT LED US TO CHOOSE YOUR SHOE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

Now I've spent 40 minutes of my Sunday, dealing with fallout from not knowing when these shoes will be available. 

I could fix this problem for you for $150,000.

How'd I arrive at this price?

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECCO) says your company has 21,000 employees worldwide. You're founded in Denmark. $1.3 billion in revenue. 

Your [2018 annual report](http://media.ecco.com/GroupCommunication/ECCO-Annual-Report-2018/#/) shows spends time on your many interests around the world, which you orchestrate, masterfully, to bring shoes to my feet, and the feet of many others around the world, for the low price of just a few hours of salary for the average person. 

Your opening of the Annual Report states:

> Entrepreneurship is deeply rooted in the ECCO culture... but we no longer have the agility of a start-up. 

That said, you see innovation across a number of portions of your business. 

_Only some of those portions are related to your e-commerce and omni-channel options for consumers._

Your mission is brilliant. 

I can help your company add at least 1.5% to your bottom line, which is $15 million dollars, by adding a small button to your website that says "notify me when this product is available in this size"

Send them an email with a link when the product comes into stock. 

Then, they'll add the shoe to their closet, and they won't have to spend two more hours searching for shoes on your website in another 4 months. 

You'll instead send them an email, and they'll have purchased the shoes, at which point you can convert these customers from one-time buyers, to your repeat customers.

I mention this all to you, and offer to fix it for $300,000, quickly and easily, because it's such an obvious good use of your money and my time. I've already spent 4x as as it took me to research and send this email as I've spent asking you to pay me to fix it. 

We'll work out the details of this solution, of course. Mobile-first, respectful to your customer, opportunity to build trust at every step of the interaction. 

As I've looked more at your company over these last few minutes, I grow increasingly interested in seeing you succeed in the world! I'd rather your company grow by 20% next year than Adidas, for instance. 

I think this proposal, and the ways we'd use it to build trust between you and your customers, would lead to substantial growth in your business, and represent an opportunity to draw a meaningful differentiator between you and the faceless, souless, giant American shoe companies. 

I just went in to my quote above, and raised the cost another $150,000, after I typed out the last two paragraphs. 

I don't want to do this feature in a way that just works, and helps get you some extra shoe sales from men who dislike shoe-shopping so much that they just want the damn shoe whenever it's available. 

That's what I planned when I opened this email. 

What I've planned now is to build this feature for you in such a way that you convert almost every single person who asks to be notified about product availability into a life-long buyer of your shoes.

This will take a _lot_ of time and resources from both of us, because it's _really hard_ to get these pieces right. The technical nature of the feature is quick and easy, but the effort and importance of building trust with customers? That's so much more. 

I'm uniquely situated to solve this problem on all of the many domains it crosses paths with. 

I'm also willing to solve the simple technical piece for half of the above figure, and build a simple technical solution like demonstrated on H&M:

![h&m](https://p64.f2.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/5zuXgmLx/Screen%20Recording%202020-05-31%20at%2007.48%20PM.gif?v=df86705d6cfb137e93fbdc3234b035fa)

That is from [Slim Fit Easy-iron Shirt](https://www2.hm.com/en_us/productpage.0781758003.html). 

It's not rocket-science, but it sure is a simple feature that I wish existed for Ecco. 

Ecco doesn't have nearly the size of a development team as H&M probably has. I'll solve this for less than the annual cost of hiring another person on your development team. 

I'd love to chat more about this. I charge $10,000 for a roadmapping session.

Roadmapping sessions:
- Take place under an NDA
- where we'd schedule calls over a day (or meet in person, depending on when we get this scheduled)
- allow detailed exploration of the problem, in a question and answer format, and I'll find _exactly_ what the work is that needs to be done to deliver the most value to your business. 
- concludes with a detailed write-up of what fixes need to be implemented

With that write-up, you can either pay me for the fixes, or hand it off to your own development team, to have them do the work. 

I do hope to set this up. 

We can schedule a 60-minute intake call for $250. You can schedule that here: 


After this call, you will be able to decide if the full roadmapping session is a reasonable next step.

I find a lot of value in other people's reviews of their years. It's the time of year to be contemplative and reflective on the last 12 months, so here we are. 

I've done annual reviews a few times now: 

- 2017 review: [2017 In Review & Thoughts on 2018]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2018-01-01-2017_review.md %})
- 2016 review: [2016 - Biggest Lesson, Most Dangerous Books]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-01-11-2016-biggest-lesson-most-dangerous-books.md %})
- 2015 review: [2015: The year I didn't think much?]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2016-01-23-2015-the-year-i-didnt-think-much.md %} ) 

I wish I had 2012-2014 reviews, but never wrote them. Therefore, I will write one for 2018 (and future years, most likely). 

## Annual Review Process

Hacker News surfaced [this post]() a few days ago. I like the format:

- Look through your calendar, week by week, over the last year
- Find the things that you found most valuable, and most disliked
- Figure out how to do more of the things you found valuable/enjoyable/meaningful, and less of the things you disliked or found least valuable.



My last year falls into a few broad categories:

- Relationships/friendships/community
- Rock climbing
- Software development
- Reading
- Travel (which dovetails into the first two categories)

<!--more-->

## Travel

Travel is a big category. I spent ~146 nights sleeping somewhere besides our apartment. Usually (109 nights) I was with Kristi somewhere, and we did a few weeks worth of dog sitting around Denver. 

Six weeks of this time was spent somewhere outside of the USA, and the rest of that time was domestic travel. 

The trips ranged from over three weeks, to over-nights. 

This is the first time I counted up all the days of travel. I'm floored. This is an insane amount of privilege and opportunity. It's also exhausting. 

The travel was almost exclusively a mix of time with friends and family, and rock climbing.

For example, Kristi and I spent ten days at my parent's house for Thanksgiving, and another ten days at her parents house for Christmas. A few weeks visiting family in the spring. About 35 of these travel days were on dedicated climbing trips. 

I'm writing this on a plane, appropriately enough. 

## Relationships/friendships/community

One of the most important things to Kristi and I are our families and friendships. We've invested in these relationships heavily over the last year, and in each other.

I've spent a fair amount of time working with Turing students, as they work through the program and others, as they are getting established in the software development industry. This is rewarding, as, despite how low the formal barriers to entry are for the industry, it's still hard to navigate from "not a developer" to "gainfully employed software developer".

If one can navigate that transition, though, the benefits are significant. It's pleasant getting treated well, and not risking physical or emotional health in a job. I enjoy discussing job hunting, being effective - and demonstrating that effectiveness - in a job, and salary negotiation. These topics are relevant to many my peers, so I enjoy trying to be useful to others in that way.

< Patrick Mckenzie tweet about investing in people >

Kristi and I changed churches this year, as well. It was a weighty decision, and one we made slowly and carefully, but ultimately was the right decision. Our new church home is fantastic, and we're glad we made the change. 

## Climbing

I've continued to improve as a climber. It's slow work, and I don't begrudge the pace of improving, but I do have a constant worry in the back of my mind that I could be training more effectively, or I have a giant hole in my knowledge about climbing, and it's crippling me _and I don't even know it._

I didn't send more than a handful of 5.13s, but I came _very_ close (falling-off-last-move-close) of five or six. I am aware that there's a gulf between "almost sending" and "sending", but I was able to quickly piece together and give valid send attempts on many hard climbs this year. 

I have been targeting the 12+ grade (12c, 12d) and did quite a few one-day sends of climbs at this grade. I've sent routes I'm pleased with in Rifle, Shelf Road, various European locations, and more. I have not tried many 5.13s, but I think I ought to be trying more. 

## Software Development

This particular item has been a long time coming. I'm no longer a freshly-minted, wet-behind-the-ears software developer. I've got a history of looking at problems and working towards solutions, then implementing those solutions. 

I've paid off technical debt, built new features, explored wildly unfamiliar pieces of technology and infrastructure, and taken production down less than once (but more than zero times. It was technically a delay in background job processing in the EU region. ([Don't leave a column without an index at any point in the migration, kids!]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2018-09-28-rails_migrations_add_unique_constraint_with_existing_duplicates.md %}))

I feel comfortable and effective in my role, even as I continue to learn many, many new things. 

For 2019, I've got a few talks scheduled at local meetups, and some other projects in the works. I spend great time and effort on this particular component of my life, but I am generally at peace, and don't feel particular anxiety towards it. 

## Reading

I read 81 books last year. ([Here's the list]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _drafts/2018_books.md %})). 

They were a mix of fiction and non-fiction, and as usual, delivered great value to me. It could be a bit excessive, the number that I've read, but I don't think it's detracted from other, more important uses of my time. 

## Spanish

I spent about two months pushing hard into furthering my Spanish. A few weeks in Spain was fantastic motivation and practice. But, as usual, when I got back state-side, the motivation for furthering my knowledge waned. Thanks to [Anki]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-06-06-memorizing-programming-with-anki.md %}), I've kept my head-knowledge, but it's practice _speaking_ that is the most effective. 

I'm generally disappointed with where my language learning efforts stand. 

## Side Projects

I started 0 side-projects this year. It was actually a bit refreshing, as in the past, side-projects would lead to me feeling guilty about not pushing them along or doing more. So, formally _not_ having side-projects (besides learning Spanish) is restful. 

I'm content with this. 

## Writing

This thing I'm doing here has been quite valuable to me. Technical and non-technical posts deliver value to me, and are easy to link to and share for others. 

I never regret writing something and publishing it, and I'd like to find more of a groove for this going forward. 

# Lessons learned

Climbing is good for my soul. 

I'm married to an incredible woman. 

In important domains, get professional insights. Read books, and if the advice/next steps are particularly difficult to implement, pay someone for help. 

In late 2018 and going forward into 2019, I have, and will continue to, invest in 1:1 time with experts in domains like: programming & software development, marriage & relationships, climbing and other forms of physical training, etc. 

I'd like to be OK with mediocrity.

I struggle to respond when people ask for training advice, but don’t want to hear that answer. If an individual likes climbing and someone suggests that the way forward is to mostly climb, you’d think that person would be excited, not resistant. The only thing I can think of that would cause that type of reaction is that the person is not satisfied with the rate of their improvement and is hoping that there is something else they can do to get better faster...Maybe there is? Maybe it’s not worth rushing? Maybe not rushing it is actually the way to speed it up? Maybe it’s more important how you do a thing than what the thing is exactly? I don’t really know. What I do know, is that I f#@%ing love to rock climb. 🤷‍♂️ I’d like to fall just a tiny bit less though.

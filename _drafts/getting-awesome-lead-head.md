I'm going to geek out on some technical elements of climbing here.

One of my favorite things to do is to teach people things. Yes, things. Anything that I have that could be of interest or use to someone else, chances are good I'd love to talk about it. (This can make me a drag in social situations. Sorry everyone...)

Another thing I really like is psychology. More specifically, decision-making and cognition. I love to understand how two people can see the exact same piece of "evidence", or hear the same story, and immediately (and confidently) reach diametrically opposed conclusions. The explanation is actually pretty simple - it has to do with prior experiences and a cognitive framework.

Finally, I love climbing. I think it's good for you, and it's a great opportunity to develop oneself in a variety of ways, all without taking yourself too seriously. (How seriously can you take yourself after spending a week in the woods without a shower, grunting and screaming like a maniac, just to get up this rock that you could easily walk to the top of? It _is_ all a little ridiculous. And this is why I love it.)

If I were to integrate these things, I would find I loved teaching people about the psychology behind decision-making while climbing. I've found this to be true, so while I worked at a climbing gym, I found myself naturally drawn to helping individual climbers (and their belayers) develop their belaying skills, so they could trust each other more while climbing, and they would, rather quickly, feel much more comfortable in situations where they once felt miserable. I saw a need to be filled, so I developed a curriculum which helped teach lead climbers and belayers how to get awesome at belaying and understanding what happened (and what to do) when a climber falls. This led to a lot of learning, both on my behalf and theirs, and it is my pleasure to present that information to you today.

I recently came across an [article](http://rigsend.com/a-very-rigsend-guide-to-sport-climbing-part-ii-there-is-nothing-to-fear-but/) about sport climbing, and more specifically, falling. The advice contained within the article is all true, but not easy to put into practice. And, if done incorrectly, it could make it even **harder** to get comfortable falling, even if you are practicing it regularly.

In the past, I spent time and effort into helping lead climbers and their belayers develop the tools they needed to become experts at climbing at their limit, be it 5.8 or 5.13. Today, I'm going to try to lay out a framework for you, so you too can understand how to safely sport climb at your absolute limit.

First, the requisite warning: _Sport climbing is dangerous, and it gets much more dangerous if you ever hit the ground with any kind of force. Please don't do that! I'm assuming that those who read this know the basics of sport climbing, and will not do something stupid like not tie in to the rope, or set the belay device up backwards. Lets not win any Darwin Awards, OK?_

The goal of this blog is as follows: **to improve your ability to take and catch falls. This article focuses equal parts on the belayer and the climber, with the goal of dramatically reducing the climbers' perceived fear of falling by building substantial skill on behalf of the belayer. Both will have an increased understanding of risk mitigation and management.**

Phew. Got that out of the way. Here we go.

Most discussions about "getting better at falling" focus on the mental game of the leader. "Start with small falls" goes the normal advice, "then move to bigger falls."

While this isn't totally wrong, there are two important elements missing. First, and most importantly, **should you trust your belayer? </**>Have you noticed that you climb harder when you trust your belayer? This is your subconscious rewarding you for making an evolutionary sound choice. Good belayer = less chance of seriously hurting yourself. For the record, there's a lot more to good belaying than just not dropping your climber. It's all about giving a soft catch, which reduces the likelihood of an injury. Most people think "yes, I trust my belayer" but their body (and thus their climbing style) says "no, I do not trust my belayer."

Next, assuming you should trust your belayer, **is it safe for you to fall?</**> The answer to that question differs wildly, but most people subconscious says to "no, it is not safe for me to fall." while they convince themselves "yes, it is safe for me to fall." Please note that this answer first depends on the belayer (are they trustworthy) and then, and only then, can it be contingent upon the actual situation you're in on the rock. Ledges, marginal gear, pendulums, and good old-fashion "I-really-really-don't-want-to-fall-right-now" all factor into the decision of safety. If you've got a clean fall and good gear but do not trust your belayer, **it is not safe for you to fall!</**>

When in doubt, assume your instincts are correct. Give yourself permission to not want to fall. It's not a matter of bravery or a proper understanding of physics. An aversion to falling comes from a sense of self-preservation. Don't get in the habit of fighting that instinct.

### The most important element

To be good at falling, you must trust your belayer. A belayer is one who can belay. An excellent belayer is not just able to belay, but is:


- Attentive
- Quick to respond
- Able to **always** give soft catches


 There are a few ways to determine if you have a skilled belayer:

**Ask them "Are you a good belayer? How do you know?" </**>If they can explain the many different considerations they must evaluate when deciding how to catch a fall, and how they respond in various situations, you can be confident they at least have an intellectual understanding of good belaying.

If they just say "yeah, I've never dropped anyone", you probably don't have an _excellent_ belayer on your hands. They may be good, but you'll probably end up spiked, or short roped, or dropped too far.

**Take a few practice falls.</**> If they give you a soft catch, great! If they don't give you a soft catch, you don't have an _excellent_ belayer on your hands.

This is the quickest way to evaluate your belayer.

There are situations like this one that could be mitigated with better belaying:

Strategic overview: Of all the members who lead climb, few are likely to climb completely without fear; a good indicator of climbing without fear is frequent falling on all areas of the wall, and climbing “hard” on lead. There should be no discrepancy between TR grades and lead grades. If there is a discrepancy, there either is a fear of falling or a technical weakness in clipping.

Most people can identify a difference in their climbing based on their confidence in their belayer. Climbers climb differently with a talented and trusted belayer than they do with an unknown or unskilled belayer. The goal of the class is to develop the “soft skills” of the belayer and climber in such a fashion that trust is built between the two, as the climber slowly and progressively builds trust and confidence in the system as the belayer develops his or her own skills.

Sellable product: This class will teach students to truly push themselves on the sharp end, while being relaxed and trying hard; upon gaining comfort with lead falling and belaying, their entire roped climbing experience will dramatically change for the better. This class is an investment in the overall climbing experience both for the climber and the belayer.

Class Format:

1. Introduction
2. Reasons for class
3. Reasons gym is offering class
4. Format of class
5. Discussion of safety, risk mitigation, etc.

Quickly move on to the exercises.

There is a progression in difficulty from mentally easy to mentally hard(er), but none of the individual steps are larger than any other individual steps. (I.E. you will be constantly outside your comfort zone, but because your comfort zone will be growing, you’ll always be the same distance outside your comfort zone, when doing whip-specific training. If your “comfort zone” is three feet wide, and you’re OK being six inches outside of it, eventually your comfort zone will be six feet wide, and you’ll still be six inches outside of it. Same level of discomfort, but three more feet of comfort zone.)

Emphasize importance of belayer throughout class. An “advanced” climber should not fall in a challenging spot on the wall without having a skilled belayer below them. It’s not a matter of dealing with fear, it’s about building trust.

Exercise progression:

The whole class should be lead climb/belay certified. Teach the class the double bowline and how to check it, and have them all use it! Instructors must demonstrate each new level of practice, and constantly emphasize not being far outside of your comfort zone.

Stage 1 Climbing/Belaying

1. TR falls at third or fourth bolt. Work primarily with belayer to get them comfortable with the timing of jumping up the wall to give climber a soft catch. Third bolt is recommended because it will regularly bring belayer and climber into close contact with each other. This is initially uncomfortable and seems dangerous. It’s not, so we might as well not let the students get in the mindset of fearing it.

If belayer is having problems with the timing and direction of jump, practice that action with them by clipping the rope through the first bolt, and taking mock falls by pulling hard on the rope.

2. Move two or three holds higher, and take progressive falls, as the climber feels comfortable with. When they can fall with the bolt at their knees or feet without significant discomfort, they’ve mastered Stage 1 climbing

- If belayer is able to give soft catches throughout, they’ve mastered stage 1 belaying.

Stage 2 Climbing

In stage 2 climbing training, we’re going to start removing the decision-making process from the climber. They will begin to lose control of when they will fall.

1. Climber climbs to third or fourth bolt, and when they’ve clipped above them, an instructor tells them to fall. They have two seconds to let go of the wall.

2. Climber climbs above bolt, and instructor tells them to fall. They have two seconds.

3. Same steps as before, but with the belayer calling out the falls.

4. Climber climbs and falls just before they were going to clip next bolt (as long as they were clipping between head and hip level)

5. Climber falls (per belayer’s instruction) with slack out to clip next bolt. Belayer should move slack back through belay device, and give soft catch. Upon being able to do this, climber has mastered stage two climbing!

Stage 2 Belaying

1. TR falls at second bolt. Work with belayer to teach them to take in slack and still hop up the wall.
2. Just above second-bolt falls. Work with belayer until he is capable of moving slack through belay device, but still hops up the wall.
3. Farther above second-bolt, still with good belaying. (Feel free to use “knee-to-the-ground” method)
4. Just by third bolt, but have not clipped it. This is a challenge for the belayer, not the climber.
5. Falling while clipping third bolt. Belayer must move slack through the device, and still give climber a soft catch. It’s acceptable that the climber lands on the ground. If belayer can do this, he’s a Stage 2 belayer.

Stage 3 climbing and belaying

1. Climber should be able to fall clipping second bolt safely. Belayer moves slack backwards through belay device, and still gives soft catch. It’s expected that climber ends on the ground, and is not spiked.
2. Should we cover skipping bolts? I (Josh) don’t think so. We cannot formally advocate it, and if they are comfortable falling while clipping, it shouldn’t represent a true barrier to their send attempts. (50 Words for Pump, RRG 5.14d the crux is clipping. One climber changed the crux clip, sent, and became the focal point of a discussion about if he should still get credit for the send.)

In theory, upon reaching this arbitrary stage, the class participants should be in a good place to go forth and try hard. Perhaps we should let them know that there can be relapses in mental fortitude, and it may be necessary to spend time intentionally practicing their mental and technical game. This class is not intended to just get people in and make them fall for a long time, but it’s intended to teach a very finite constellation of skills to a climber/belayer, and send them back to the gym or crag, ready to rumble.

Details to keep in mind:

- Some climbers may have a significant discomfort with the act of falling. Identify these individuals, and explain to them some sports psychology about worst-case scenario thinking, and the importance of not just trying to push through the discomfort. If they push through the discomfort without dealing with it, they will never grow comfortable progressing into more and more challenging situations.
- It is reasonable for a staff member to belay the climber for ten or fifteen “easy” falls in quick succession, if climber is willing, in order to create a sense of comfort with said easy fall. If they are comfortable now, they will recognize the “sense of peace” felt when taking a fall. This peacefulness we hope to maintain throughout the course.
- Feel free to give plenty of demonstrations, with the staff belaying each other. Emphasize the role of weight differences, and demonstrate how the process of catching falls changes based on who is heavier.

I hope this is helpful to all who have read it. Feel free to get in touch with me if you have further questions or find it particularly helpful.

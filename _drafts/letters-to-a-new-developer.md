Go deep, as much as possible, throughout your work day.

Guard your hours of 'deep work'. 

Track your progress and learning. 

Reflect on your progress from one month to the next. 

Realize that you do more than write code; you contribute to the business, either by helping increase revenue or decrease cost.

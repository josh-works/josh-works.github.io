I read many books in 2017. I'm listing them out here, along with recommendations. Here's the recommendation "key":

- 👍 = I recommend this book. This is intentionally ill-defined
- 🤔 = This book influenced my mental model of the world/reality/myself
- 🏢 = Book topic is architecture and/or urbanism
- 💵 = Book topic is finance/economics/politics
- 😫 = This book is hard to get through. Lengthy and/or academic (or both)
- 🦖 = Fiction (most of the fiction I read had fantastic(al) creatures in them, hence the t-rex)

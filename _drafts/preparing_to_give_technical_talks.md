A few weeks ago, I gave two talks about Ruby and Rails:
1. An 8-minute "lightning talk" about using `.count` vs `.size` in ActiveRecord query methods
2. A 30-minute talk at the Boulder Ruby Group arguing that developers should _embrace_ working with non-development business functions, and finding slow SQL queries, and using `.count` vs `.size` in AR query methods.

## Things that went well

I enjoyed actually _giving_ the talks, but I found the preparation process to be brutal, and felt quite anxious in the ten days or so leading up to the talks. 

## Things that went poorly

I finalized both talks a few minutes before leaving to give them, and was up late at night the night before doing the lions share of the preparation within 20 hours of when the talk was due.

I was, therefore, sleep deprived.

## What I would do differently

I spent most of my time worrying about what I was going to talk about, and what technical topic I knew well enough to dive into and explain to a bunch of _super experienced_ software developers at the Boulder Ruby Group. I thought "I have nothing useful to say. They've forgotten more about Ruby than I will ever know."

I got unblocked from this problem late in the game. I found [article on thinking about "what you want to share"](), and started thinking about this problem from the other end. 

Instead of thinking 
> What do I know well enough to talk about to seasoned professionals

I thought 
> What do I know, or what perspective do I have, that might be useful to a crowd of experienced software developers?

Turns out I've got stuff there, and a few stories that could prove to be instructive. 

Once I was thinking in this direction, I was back in my "normal" operating mode - I like to share everything I can about what I'm learning, knowng that someone else out there might find value in it. I often share very basic things, because they either are not basic to me, or if they _are_ basic to me, I still didn't learn about them until "recently", and it might be my day to learn the obvious thing.

(link to XKCD 10000 people/day learn obvious things) 

So, I _embraced_ being the least experienced developer in the room, and suddenly had a topic to talk about.

## The slides

I used Keynote, and never considered doing any live coding. It often doesn't go well, and I didn't want to have to be improvising even more on the fly than I would be. 

So, I made heavy use of screenshots and gifs, and weaved them into a slide deck. 

I started with paper notes I put together on the talks I was giving. They were haphazardly organized, but I dutifully transcribed everything into a slide.  

I wrote out "whole sentances" on slides, sometimes paragraphs. I was working in the direction of creating that great faux paux, of reading my slides to the audience. 

I shuffled slides around, added sentences/bullet-points where needed, often giving the talk in small chunks "in my head", and making adjustments as I went. 

Once I had a basic "flow" down, I pulled the sentances out of the slide and copied into the presenter notes below the slide, and dropped a few related words into the content of the slide. 

The few words would be enough to remind me what I wanted to talk about, and I could reference the presenter notes if needed, and now, without my narration, the meaning of each slide wasn't obvious when it popped up.

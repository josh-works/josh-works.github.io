OK, local politics.

This is the first I'm writing about running for Golden City Council besides some static pages (like [josh.works/golden](http://josh.works/golden) and [josh.works/issues](http://josh.works/issues)).

I'm conflicted and torn, and have a bunch of drafts sitting around, trying to capture my feelings on running for city council.

# First, why am I conflicted?

Lots of reasons. Summary here:

- Politics, and by extension, politicians, have a well-deserved sullied reputation.
- I'm trying to "be a politician I would support", but I have problems with legalized coercion, so I don't really support any use of political power.
- Getting elected, and the things I've done to try to make that happen, feels like trying to win a popularity contest. I am simultaneously somewhat competent in this department, and despise the fact that I'm good at it.
- I'm simultaneously job-hunting AND running for local office, and feel like I'm trying to make everyone like me.
- There's an odd fetishizing of "public service" in getting elected, but I'm not trying to serve anyone. I see local politics as the best ROI for trying to make things happen that I want to see happen.

National politics is a trashfire, as is state-level politics, and most local politics. Not everyone will agree with me, and that's fine. If I meet someone who's involved in politics in any capacity, and they don't ask for any apology or blush a little at what they do, I grow skeptical of them.

Again, few people agree with me, but ultimately the state is in the business of sustaining itself, and it does this on the backs of it's "citizens". The relationship between state and citizens is similar to that of dairy farmer and milk cows.

I view the system as morally flawed, and am still conflicted about any interaction with it.

I've gone door-to-door passing out fliers with my face on them, asking people to vote for me. When's the last time you've had conversations with dozens of people in just a few hours?

I'm a youngish white dude with tolerable genes and I'm competent at quickly putting people at ease, which is partially a function of being a youngish white dude with tolerable genes. I've done sales in the past, and have no problem "making an ask".

> Hey - I'm running for city council. Crazy, huh? I know. Anyway, will you vote for me? You will? Thanks! Just check the box next to "Josh Thompson" on the ballot. kthanksbye.

In other words, I'm trying to win a popularity contest, and I'm good at it. I might be a *terrible* "politician", and few people have tried to ascertain my capabilities for the job. The scary thing is - I think they're right either way.

Most politicians don't go door-to-door, so one that does already passes a few cognitive filters. If you happen to be skeptical of a door-to-door politician, and despite this skepticism, one puts you at ease, he passes a few additional filters of "probably not a sociopath" and "seems like a good enough neighborly-type, so yeah, probably better than the alternative."

So, the fact that I'm playing a popularity contest game, *and* skills at "being popular" may have some predictive power in being a politician annoys me to no end. (The solution to this is not "build a better political system" but "recognize that giving some group of people the means of exercising legal (but immoral) violence against others will always suck for the out-group.")

## I'm simultaneously job-hunting AND running for local office, and feel like I'm trying to make everyone like me.

I have a few weaknesses. One of them is pumpkin pie. Another one is that I generally want people to like me. I just finished a software development program and am lining up my first *remote* software development job. So, that means using this website to try to convince potential employers that I'm the kind of person that will do good work, and will be an asset to their team, etc. (Er, if that's you - I'll be great! Lets talk...)

I'm *also* trying to convince random people out there to vote for me. I'm refusing to campaign in any other capacity than assuming the best of others. If I'm offended by people pandering to me, I will never pander to someone else.

So, I feel uniquely fragile in how much of these dual goals are driven by "being liked". I've spent great effort to distance my tolerable life outcomes from how much I'm liked (E.G. I'd rather be useful than loved), but I'm not quite there.

Normally my life goals are way more in my control. Things like "be a good husband", "be a passable programmer", "climb 5.13", none of these involve public opinion.

## There's an odd fetishizing of "public service" in getting elected, but I'm not trying to serve anyone. I see local politics as the best ROI for trying to make things happen that I want to see happen.

As a member of Golden's city council, I will get paid about $1300/month. If this was really public service, that should be free, right? (Or, that would exclude everyone but rich people, so it should be full time and a much larger amount... or, then, that would encourage graft, so maybe it should be paid in food with subsidized housing. Wait, that doesn't quite work, lets do...)

So, if I'm getting paid, it's not "being a servant". If the legal apparatus of the state is being handed to me, and I get to compel you to make decisions I think you should make, and generally interfere in your life, that *smells* a lot more like *you* are serving *me*.

So, between getting paid to do this, and being able to dictate to you how your life should run, _this is not public service_.

Some people have asked why I don't generally attend community political events, and take the opportunity to influence our elected leaders.

I don't do that because it's a waste of my time.

I'm getting involved in politics because most of the nation is on the path to bankruptcy, and nosy neighbors get to dictate every conceivable form and function of every aspect of a neighborhood, causing the collective loss of wealth of billions to young folks.

I'm not going to sit and _ask_ someone to kindly please consider not ruining the town, if they don't mind. I'd rather just leave town and move somewhere better. At the moment, Golden's the nicest piece of real estate Kristi and I have encountered, and we think it's got a good thing going. So I'm going to try to head off the [Growth Ponzi Scheme](https://www.strongtowns.org/the-growth-ponzi-scheme/) killing the rest of the nation.

If I don't get elected, not only will I breath a sigh of relief, I'll not be involved in local politics at all. I won't start attending meetings, or argue with people about housing policy. I'll just quietly work on my career and my climbing and being a good husband, and move out of Golden when the time seems right.

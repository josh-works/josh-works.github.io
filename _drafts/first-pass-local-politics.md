OK, local politics.

This is the first I'm writing about running for Golden City Council besides some static pages, like [josh.works/golden](http://josh.works/golden) and [josh.works/issues](http://josh.works/issues).

I'm conflicted and torn, and have a bunch of drafts sitting around, trying to capture my feelings on running for city council.

I'm writing this to basically exonerate myself from the guilt I feel around running for office. In a different era, I'd be told to [pay indulgences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indulgence), but this is 2017, so us guilty folk blog about things. I've got other thoughts in the pipeline about local politics, but this will be the undergirding them all.

# First, why am I conflicted?

Lots of reasons. Summary here:

- Politics, and by extension, politicians, have a well-deserved sullied reputation.
- I'm trying to "be a politician I would support", but I have problems with legalized coercion, so I don't really support any use of political power.
- Getting elected, and the things I've done to try to make that happen, feels like trying to win a popularity contest. I am simultaneously somewhat competent in this department, and despise the fact that I'm good at it.
- I'm simultaneously between jobs AND running for local office, and feel like I'm trying to make everyone like me.
- There's an odd fetishizing of "public service" in getting elected, but I'm not trying to serve anyone. I see local politics as the best ROI for trying to make things happen that I want to see happen.

# Second, why am I getting involved anyway?

A few reasons. Summary here:

- I perceive an interventionist state to be a hazard to the unfavored groups that reside within it's borders.
- I don't value consensus-building, so to drive an agenda, the best path forward is to be a decision-maker.
- I'm curious to see how the sausage is made
- I'm pretty pessimistic on the beneficial uses of coercion, and can maybe act as sand-in-the-gears in the exercise of that power.

# Reasons to be conflicted


## Politics, and by extension, politicians, have a well-deserved sullied reputation

National politics is a trashfire, as is state-level politics, and most local politics. Not everyone will agree with me, and that's fine. If I meet someone who's involved in politics in any capacity, and they don't ask for any apology or blush a little at what they do, I grow skeptical of them.

## I'm trying to "be a politician I would support", but I have problems with legalized coercion, so I don't really support any use of political power.

Again, few people agree with me, but ultimately the state is in the business of sustaining itself, and it does this on the backs of it's "citizens". The relationship between state and citizens is similar to that of dairy farmer and milk cows.

I view the system as morally flawed, and am still conflicted about any interaction with it.

## Getting elected, and the things I've done to try to make that happen, feels like trying to win a popularity contest. I am simultaneously somewhat competent in this department, and despise the fact that I'm good at it.

I've gone door-to-door passing out fliers with my face on them, asking people to vote for me. When's the last time you've had conversations with dozens of people in just a few hours?

I'm a youngish white dude with tolerable genes and I'm competent at quickly putting people at ease, which is partially a function of being a youngish white dude with tolerable genes. I've done sales in the past, and have no problem "making an ask".

> Hey - I'm running for city council. Crazy, huh? I know. Anyway, will you vote for me? You will? Thanks! Just check the box next to "Josh Thompson" on the ballot. kthanksbye.

In other words, I'm trying to win a popularity contest, and I'm good at it. I might be a *terrible* "politician", and few people have tried to ascertain my capabilities for the job. The scary thing is - I think they're right either way.

Most politicians don't go door-to-door, so one that does already passes a few cognitive filters. If you happen to be skeptical of a door-to-door politician, and despite this skepticism, one puts you at ease, he passes a few additional filters of "probably not a sociopath" and "seems like a good enough neighborly-type, so yeah, probably better than the alternative."

So, the fact that I'm playing a popularity contest game, *and* skills at "being popular" may have some predictive power in being a politician annoys me to no end.

The solution to this "how to be a good politician" is not "build a better political system" but "recognize that giving some group of people the means of exercising legal (but immoral) violence against others will always suck for the out-group."

## I'm simultaneously between jobs AND running for local office, and feel like I'm trying to make everyone like me.

I have a few weaknesses. One of them is pumpkin pie. Another one is that I generally want people to like me.

I just finished a software development program and am lining up my first *remote* software development job. So, that means using this website to try to convince potential employers that I'm the kind of person that will do good work, and will be an asset to their team, etc. (Er, if that's you - I'll be great! Lets talk...)

I'm *also* trying to convince random people out there to vote for me. I'm refusing to campaign in any other capacity than assuming the best of others. If I'm offended by people pandering to me, I will never pander to someone else.

So, I feel uniquely fragile in how much of these dual goals are driven by "being liked". I've spent great effort to distance my "tolerable life outcomes" from how much I'm liked, and I'm *almost* there.

Normally my life goals are way more in my control. Things like "be a good husband", "be a passable programmer", "climb 5.13", none of these involve public opinion.

## There's an odd fetishizing of "public service" in getting elected, but politics cannot serve "the community", it can only serve "groups who exercise power and influence". I see local politics as the best ROI for trying to make things happen that I want to see happen.

As a member of Golden's city council, I will get paid about $1300/month. If this was really public service, that should be free, right?

Or, that would exclude everyone but rich people, so it should be full time and a much larger amount... or, then, that would encourage graft, so maybe it should be paid in food with subsidized housing. Wait, that doesn't quite work, lets do something else...

So, if I'm getting paid, it's not "being a servant". If the legal apparatus of the state is being handed to me, and I get to compel you to make decisions I think you should make, and generally interfere in your life, that *smells* a lot more like *you* are serving *me*.

So, between getting paid to do this, and being able to dictate to you how your life should run, _this is not public service_.

# Reasons I'm running for office anyway

After the long diatribe above, it is hard to imagine I'm actually doing anything, right?

## I perceive an interventionist state to be a hazard to the unfavored groups that reside within it's borders.

Depending on the issue at hand, those unfavored groups could be: old people, young people, white people, black people, rich people, poor people, employers, employees, citizens-by-birth, immigrants, etc.

I'd rather not subsidize some groups at the expense of others. So, I'd agitate in that direction. Remember - a state strong enough to give you what you want is strong enough to take it away.

## I don't value consensus-building, so to drive an agenda, the best path forward is to be a decision-maker.

Most political folk see value in consensus-driven decision-making. This maybe worked well when the nation was founded, and in contrast to a monarchy, but I think we've seen the breadth of personal preferences expand to such a state that no single option can make everyone happy.

Imagine we had to wear clothing, all designed by consensus and group decision making. It would be terrible.

Politicians are bound by the [Overton window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window), and have bad [mental models](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/mental-models/) of how the world works, but great mental models for maneuvering in the land of politics.

I think this disconnect from reality and having skin in the game harms us all. Most of those sins are hidden under the banner of "consensus".

Since I have insane ideas about politics, rather than argue/try to convince elected officials to do something (like remove regulations that dictates a massive auto-oriented lifestyle) I'd rather get to have a vote, and try to convince the others from the inside.

## I'm curious to see how the sausage is made

In case you cannot tell, I'm pessimistic about the political process. But I'm also curious. I'd like to note and share all of the oddities to the political process I observe, and perhaps highlight instances when the political process seems to work against citizens.

I suspect the latter happens regularly, but the only way to confirm is to be part of the process.

## I'm pretty pessimistic on the beneficial uses of coercion, and can maybe act as sand-in-the-gears in the exercise of that power.

Lots of federal, state, and local legislation has put us on the path to the [Growth Ponzi Scheme](https://www.strongtowns.org/the-growth-ponzi-scheme/), and while a few people are getting rich, the rest of us are going to pay a price down the road.

If I can act as sand in the gears of this kind of process, I'll gladly do so.

------------------

If I don't get elected, not only will I breathe a sigh of relief, I'll not be involved in local politics at all. I won't start attending meetings, or argue with people about housing policy. I'll just quietly work on my career and my climbing and being a good husband, and move out of Golden when the time seems right.

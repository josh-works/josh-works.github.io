OK, local politics.

This is the first word I'm "publishing" on my website, besides some static pages (like [josh.works/golden](http://josh.works/golden) and [josh.works/issues](http://josh.works/issues)).

I'm conflicted and torn, and have a bunch of drafts sitting around, trying to capture my feelings on running for city council.

First, why am I conflicted?

### Politics, and by extension, politicians, have a well-deserved sullied reputation, in my book

National politics is a trashfire, as is state-level politics. Not everyone will agree with me, and that's fine. If I meet someone who's involved in politics in any capacity, and they don't ask for any apology or blush a little at what they do, I grow skeptical of them.

### I'm trying to "be a politician I would support", but I have problems with legalized coercion, so I don't really support any use of political power.

Again, few people agree with me, but ultimately the state is in the business of sustaining itself, and it does this on the backs of it's "citizens". The relationship between state and citizens is similar to that of dairy farmer and milk cows.

I view the system as morally flawed, and am still conflicted about any interaction with it.

### Getting elected, and the things I've done to try to make that happen, feels like trying to win a popularity contest. I am simultaneously somewhat skilled in this department, and despise the fact that I'm good at it.

I've gone door-to-door passing out fliers with my face on them, asking people to vote for me. When's the last time you've had conversations with dozens of people in just a few hours?

I'm a youngish white dude with tolerable genes and I'm skilled at quickly putting people at ease, which is partially a function of being a youngish white dude with tolerable genes. I've done sales in the past, and have no problem "making an ask".

> Hey - I'm running for city council. Crazy, huh? I know. Anyway, will you vote for me? You will? Thanks! Just check the box next to "Josh Thompson" on the ballot. kthanksbye

In other words, I'm trying to win a popularity contest, and I'm good at it. I might be a *terrible* administrator, but few people have tried to ascertain my capabilities for the job. The scary thing is - I think they're right either way.

Most politicians don't go door-to-door, so one that does already passes a few cognitive filters. If you happen to be skeptical of a door-to-door politician, and one puts you at ease, he passes a few additional filters of "probably not a sociopath" and "seems like a good enough neighborly-type, so yeah, probably better than the alternative."

### I'm simultaneously job-hunting, and feel like I'm trying to make everyone like me.

I have a few weaknesses. One of them is pumpkin pie. Another one is that I generally want people to like me. I just finished a software development program and am lining up my first *remote* software development job. So, that means using this website to try to convince potential employers that I'm the kind of person that will do good work, and will be an asset to their team, etc. (Er, if that's you - I'll be great! Lets talk...)

I'm *also* trying to convince random joe out there to vote for me. I'm refusing 

### There's an odd fetishizing of "public service" in getting elected, but I'm not trying to serve anyone. I see local politics as the best ROI for trying to make things happen that I want to see happen

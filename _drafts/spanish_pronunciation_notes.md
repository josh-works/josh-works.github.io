I'm a big fan of Idaho Ness. Working through his "Elemental Sounds of Spanish" course. 

Something feels right about his approach to language learning, which is "if you can pronounce perfectly, you'll learn the language!". I don't know anyone who pronounces things well, yet doesn't speak the language well. 

I know many people who have horrible pronunciation, and can barely speak the language. Correlation, Causation, etc. I know.

Anyway, here we are. 

I want to be able to speak Spanish _perfectly_. I have an OK accent right now, but I cannot roll my R's, and have some other problems in my pronunciation.

I'll capture my pronunciation and (maybe) post it here, before and after.

<!--more-->

## Figure out how locals speak the language

I want to "sound like them". 

It'll paper over some of my bad vocab and grammar. 

More importantly - i'll get better at _hearing_ them. 

I think eventually this will lead to me speaking with more speed, fluidity, and confidence.

A quick note - (find penelopy truck post from 09/17/18). Looks like of all bi-lingual people, 90% of them learned the languages as children. Another 7% learned in school (I assume high school/college).

That leaves 3% of bi-lingual folks learned it themselves, outside of school. 

1/2 of Americans don't speak a second language. of the other half, only 3% learned the language on their own. 

So, I'm a bit off on my own. 

## I've learned a lot of vocabulary, but don't know how much language I've learned

So, I'll take a break from the vocab, and start pushing forward on what I can hear.

I've learned maybe... one song in Spanish. I'd like to bump that to ten.


## What's the end goal, anyway?

Communicate and connect with others. My grandparents are spanish. I have a lot of family in Paraguay. I _cannot talk to them_. I have family in Spain. _I cannot talk to them_. 

This causes me not just frustration, but _shame_. I feel like I "should" be able tp speak Spanish, but I cannot. I feel like all the "skills" have been handed to me, but then I've not been able to combine those skills into conversational fluency in Spanish. 

I am good in English. I'm a good conversationalist. I improvise well. I can sell, cajole, convince, entertain, teach, encourage, empathize, and much more, all in English. 

I cannot do that in Spanish. I want to do that in Spanish. 




## Misc other notes

- Most people struggle with sound. In some languages, sound is _critial_ to communication. Not always a "nice to have". 
- Conversational fluency is separate and superior to written fluency. 
- Premature literacy is a huge problem. maybe my inability to "see" things in my head will work to my advantage. 
- my ear cannot _hear_ the Spanish sounds. 

#### Phonetics

I'll learn the basics of phonetics. (Anki! I visual concept of my "speech organ". I can do this.)

Then, I'll categorize them acoustically and physically. 

Next, I'll be able to "appreciate" the sound, in isolation. (Map the sound to it's matching name/character in the phonetic chart?)

Then I'll differentiate similar sounds, and do audio drills. (Anki some more!)

Develop physical awareness of my mouth/tongue, etc. (proprioception). 

Awareness first, then control. (God, this framework makes so much sense.)

Lots of drills. I FUCKING LOVE DRILLS!!!!

#### Two types of elemental sounds

*Vowel Sounds*

> when airflow through the mouth is _unrestricted_ and _unobstructed_

Differentiated by three "features"

- Tongue position 
- Lip roundedness
- Nasality (let air out the velum, the nose)

(I can make audio fucking flashcards around this shit)

*Consent Sounds*

> airflow through the mount *is* _restricted_ or _ubstructed_

Differentiated by:

- place of articulation ("Duh" vs "Guh")
- manner of articulation (lateral vs. blocking)
- phonation (vibration?) Glottis.

Difference between "t" and "d" sound. t is voiceless, D is "voiced"

#### Mispronunciation 

So, this all said - what is "mispronunciation"? 

Best "pronunciation" is what allows me to communicate/connect with others.

I want to "converge" on the sound of those I'm visiting. (Spain spanish _and_ Paraguay spanish?)

*Divergence of vowel sound*

- different tongue position
- different lip shape
- different nasal airflow


*Divergence of consonant sound*

- divergent place of articulation
- divergent manner of articulation
- divergent nasal phonation


*Divergence of Melody*

- sound duration (too long/too short)
- sound loudness 
- sound pitch (intonation, rise/fall)


Modern poetry? Rhyme and Rhythm


# Homework 


Hearing and pronunciation let you not get distracted by what you're trying to _read_. 

End goal = "communicate & connect"

Mispronounce means "divergence" between vowel/consonant sounds, or a divergence of melody. 

vowel sound: unrestricted/unobstructed air through the face.
Consonant sound: obstructed or restricted air through the face

features of vowel sounds:

- tongue position
- lip roundedness
- nasality 

Features of consonant sounds

- place of articulation
- manner of articulation (lateral vs. blocking)
- phonation 

9 forms of mispronunciation:

- tongue postion
- lip shape
- nasal airflow
- place of articulation
- manner of articulation
- phonation
- sound duration
- sound loudness
- sound pitch

# Application of technical concepts

| Word | elemental sound count (total) | consonant sound count | vowel sound count|
|---|---|---|---|
| hello | 4 | 2 | 2 |
| left | 4 | 3 | 1 |
| cause | 3 | 2 | 1 |
| chimpanzee | 8 | 5 | 3 | 
| incredible | 9 | 6 | 2 | 
| porcelain | 8 | 5 | 3 | 
| thermometer | 10 | 4 | 2 | 
| perception | 8 | 6 | 2 | 
| throughput | 6 | 4 | 2 |
| onomatopoeia | 9 | 4 | 5 | 


## Beginning Alteration 

Mad => mike made micro men mum
paper => pence paid patty pretty plastic 
lucky => lucy let lads lay low 
tiny => tammy took ten ticklish tugs 

## rhyme last word

mum => dumb
plastic => elastic 
low => dough
tugs => bugs

## Ending Alliteration 

dumb => dour doughboys dont dart dumb
elastic => electric eels eschew elegant elastic
dough => damsels daintily down damned dough
bugs => bastard's books brew bold bugs


mike made micro men mum
dour doughboys dont dart dumb

pence paid patty pretty plastic 
electric eels eschew elegant elastic

lucy let lads lay low 
damsels daintily down damned dough

tammy took ten ticklish tugs 
bastard's books brew bold bugs



Formula for making an alliterative rhyming poem:

1. get four random words 
2. make a five-word alliterative sentence that starts with that word
3. For each sentence, generate a word that rhymes with the last word in that sentence
4. For each word, come up with a 5-word alliterative sentence that ENDS with that word
5. Combine sentences together for an alliterative rhyming poem!

## Introduction 

A few months ago, maybe in November, certainly by December, I began this 'barefoot sprinting up grassy hills' thing I'm going to talk about. Shortly after I started, I began making use of the kettlebells I'd usually ignored at the gym(s) I have access to. 

I've been dual-tracking in time the two topics in this piece, kettlebell swings and sprints, but because of how text works, I must discuss one of them first, and one of them second. 

I've been hustling the kettlebell swings hard lately, as an extremely specific and helpful climbing training action, lately. As usual, I've got a page or three of paper notes that I've put together across time, and am now bringing it to here and organizing it.

Many years ago, I [wrote my first piece about kettlebell swings]({{ site.baseurl  }}{% link _posts/2013-05-09-daily-exercise-russian-kettlebells.md %}). 

Then I was using 55 kettlebells, and didn't have access to other sizes. Now that I have access to _real_ kettlebells, and at a variety of weights, I find a lot more interestingness for myself.

I still stand by that piece, and regularly since then have made kettlebell swings a part of how I use my body. Maybe two months ago I brought kettlebell swings back into my life, first time in many years, and I'm thrilled. My back feels AMAZING, and a bunch of other things. 

In case this information makes it incrementally more likely that any reader harvests any of the same nice things, here's all of my beta. I try to [write things when it's first coalecing in my mind]({{ site.baseurl  }}{% link _posts/2021-10-05-write-it-now.md %}), and this current piece is no exception. 

## Kettlebell Swings

TODO: Add video of 2-handed swings.

[here's a link to an album containing two videos - two-handed swings, reps 80-100, with a 75 lb kettlebell, and one-handed at 55 lbs](https://photos.app.goo.gl/WDmZQuUpPWGmMRPh6)

The blog post [about kettlebell swings I wrote now 12 years ago]({{ site.baseurl  }}{% link _posts/2013-05-09-daily-exercise-russian-kettlebells.md %}) is still a good-enough starting point. 

I remember getting a TON out of kettlebell swings long ago, part of training for a high-elevation marathon, and I'm thrilled that I used them then. It helped my back stay healthy, for sure. Then, after I stopped running, I stopped the kb swings, and then WRECKED!!!! my back doing something completely unrelated, and have not run since then. (More on sprinting below)

Also didn't really do kb swings the last few years. 

Then, for reasons that do not have anything to do with climbing, I found a way to bring back into my life running, and kettlebell swings, and have noticed so many interesting things as a result. In a way that is no longer surprising to me, my climbing has also been nicely effected as well.

Originally, I didn't expect the exercise to do anything for my climbing, and in fact felt bummed when the kettlebell swings would sometimes leave me tired enough that I felt I was having a lower-effort, 'maintenence' climbing session, rather than a fresh, 'try-hard' session.

That is all, in hind sight, exactly how I'd want it to be done and I'm thrilled by it all. Here's my notes:

I really don't like to work hard, or even breath that hard. When doing my swings, I always breath through my nose, per [Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48890486-breath). 

I started with sets of 5-10 reps. Then rest until my breath returns all the way to normal, then do more. Keep going at a low rate of effort until ~100 reps, if feeling good. If I'm a little sick or whatever, I found myself dropping the weight a lot and still finding 60 reps difficult enough to stop there. (that was part of how I knew I was sick at the time. Came down with a slow-onset illness, and I noticed it first by a stunning loss of power. 60 reps of a 60 lb kb is vastly less work than 110 reps of a 75 lb kettlebell, but when I was sick the 60 reps at low weight were harder than the 110 reps of 75lb swings)

It's impossible to do kb swings well without chalk, I used to try to not use chalk, or I'd do swings even if I didn't have chalk, and that is no longer the case. i found the weights I was using to be so heavy that simply holding on to the dang thing was often-enough a hard part of the exercise. 

As soon as any part of the form would 'break', if it ever did, I'd end the set. It almost never broke. I have some video of two-handed kb swings and one-arm kb swings, i'll maybe add it to this post. I'm pleased with it, because it shows that my form is and looks perfect, even though I know the exercises were quite effortful. 

sometimes, usually, I'd begin the climbing session with kettlebell swings. 

Sometimes I'd do _only_ kb swings, and would not climb, if I didn't feel like climbing. the gym I use is close enough that I can walk to it, and will walk by it often enough even if I don't seek it out, so it's trivial for me to pop in for a few minutes of using a single piece of equipment, and then carrying on with my day. #scooterthings 

Often enough, when doing the kb swings before the climbing session, I'd notice how nice it felt to be really warmed up, and warmed up with _speed_, not just slow 'warm up' climbing. 

The kb is very demanding, and takes speed, the same way that jumping into the air takes certain speed. It's really nice to soak the nervous system in this level of effort, and helps for the climbing.

I'd do the kb swings, and feel _really_ well warmed up for bouldering. I also sometimes would feel really _sore_ from the kb swings in ways that would be EXTREMELY OBVIOUS when I was climbing. I was _thrilled_ bc that meant I was getting a ton of useful crossover.

if you shrug your shoulders next to your ears, AND pushing them back 'down' - these were very often the muscles that I'd feel EXTREME fatigue in, across days and weeks, and plenty of other muscles, but these were some of the surprising ones.

I pretty quickly dialed down perfect technique, and then started adding weight. I got to 75 lb swings, spent a few sessions there, that was the heaviest kettlebell at that gym, then I found an 88 lb kettlebell at a different gym and have now used that one a few times.

The first time I did it, I'd still not tried any one-handed kettlebell swings. I've now done a bunch, and the second time I used that 88 lb kettlebell, it felt _shockingly_ easy to hold on to and swing, compared to how it felt the first time. It's still wildly hard. That 2nd set was yesterday, as I type these words, I can feel soreness in my thumb, if I stretch it, each of my fingers, and much more.

it's a high-value 5 minutes in every session. i almost always do 100 swings. even when moving slow, it's only like 7 minutes. If you read half this blog post, you'll spend longer on it than I spend on most kettlebell swinging sessions. 

I weigh 140lbs and started with a 55lb kb, then 65, then 75, then 88. Spent a few sessions at each weight before going up one. I switched to one-arm work with a 45 lb suitcase/farmers carry a few times, then 55lb one-arm swings, then 60 lbs, and get use from 45lb one-arm swings too.

I do between 60 and 130 reps of two-arm swings, and started with like ten reps of one-arm swings, then 20, 30, and have not done more than 40 in a session so far. 

### an unexpected variation: One-handed kettlebell swings

I've got a video of me doing one-handed kb swings [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/WDmZQuUpPWGmMRPh6)

I started one-handed swings the very first time on accident, because when I went to the gym, the 60 and 75 lb kettlebells were in use. So I grabbed the 55, and thought "i bet I can still get a version of the exercise I want". 

Oh, wow, I was correct.

It feels so stability-encouraging of my toros, back, spine, 'the box' of the upper body, because of it's assymetric nature. 

I could feel my spine and the mucles along it, and the entire "box" of my upper body (sides, front, back, bottom of my core). 

My forearms and hands were quite nicely stressed by the effort - I could feel the familiar sense of fatigue in the muscles/connective tissue inside of my hands, the fleshy part of my thumb, I could feel fatigue and stress in the middle bone of my fingers, too. not the bone in the tip, not the bone connecting to the palms. The one in between. How nice.

I could feel sensation from the muscles along my spine all that night and the next day - nothing felt painful or damaged, AND I could tell the entire system had been thoroughly stressed. It felt so good.

I could feel my rib intercostals and so many stabilizing muscles that night, feeling so sore and happy as I crawled into bed and went to sleep. I've had that feeling in my body now _every time_ I've done KB swings, and usually carry perceivable fatigue into the next day, but it's partially because I'm increasing the 'work' that I do every session. 

Once I started one-arm swings, I'd do five reps at a time, per side. I started at 55lbs, then went to 60 a few times, tried 45 lb swings once, liked it, and will probably keep upping the reps and weight as it feels good. 

I'll slowly ease the rep count up, and sets. I started with 5 reps per side, then did 8, then reduced the weight and went to ten reps per side, and maybe 40 swings total. 

### an unexpected crossover: Kettlebell Swings and Climbing

I noticed lots of kb-swing-related soreness while climbing. Some climbing move would feel very sensory-rich because of how it was interacting with soreness recepters. 

The soreness in my hands after the KB swings is similar to the soreness in my hands after squeezing fruit in my palm while pulling 

## upgrades/modifications of the kb swing

Once doing a little with a two-armed kb swing, I found myself doing a bit more. 

- Hold a kb that's like 1/3rd your body weight while standing around, or stretching, or shifting weight and doing bodyweight squats and stretches and stuff. Bounce on the toes. Switch it back and forth between your hands often. I started with like a small number of minutes of holding it, while moving around. The one-arm weight/motion is very interesting, both while moving around or perhaps while remaining very still.
- after a 45 lb suitcase carry, a 55lb one-arm kb swing isn't such a leap, even though at first I surprised even myself with how much I could move with the single-armed swing.
- try to move slowly under/around the kb. Think doing light yoga while holding a kettlebell. mega challenging, interesting. 

So much for kettlebells. These have been something I've been doing regularly now for a few months. The same length of time that I've been doing this sprinting thing...

## Barefoot Grassy Hill Sprints In The Park

I started these sprints I am about to describe before I restarted the KB swings. 

The sprints had been going great for maybe two weeks, and then one of the times I walked past the kettlebells at the gym, I was like 'my back and legs are already feeling great/tired, maybe i'll be able to do kettlebell swings without my back feeling terrible the next day.' 

I was right. 

Anyway, here's free-associating through sprints, as recorded in a paper notebook across a few days:

- The idea originally had nothing to do with "running". it started with 'grounding'. A few friends have spoken in some length about grounding, over the years, the idea always seemed plausible, and I never did any particular action in response to it. years later, another friend that I'd meet at Cheesman Park, throwing frisbee, talked about it as he was taking his shoes off on a warm day in the fall, a few months ago.

I thought 'what a reasonable idea', as I took my own shoes/socks off and went barefoot for the rest of the frisbee throwing session. Eventually, I started going barefoot often-enough when the weather was nice and we were throwing a frisbee, but usually never took more than a few lazy steps at a time to catch a disk, while barefoot.

relevant: years ago (2020) I took a gnarly back injury and basically have not run since then, and for a long time could barely walk. Then even short walks would wreck me. Shortly before the injury, I'd run the Leadville Trail Marathon, and was climbing, so I was pretty abled, and the difference was profound. Deserves it's own blog post or two, some time. As I think on it, it really changed me, the time of that injury, the things I experienced immediately afterwards. 

also relevant, years before that injury, after reading the [Born to Run](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6289283-born-to-run) book that made the rounds, maybe in 2009 or 2012 or whenever. That was the one and only other time in my 35 years I'd done a specific 'barefoot run', for like 12 minutes, on a patch of grass at a park. My calves were DESTROYED, even though it was a short run, and I was used to long runs in normal shoes. I never ran barefoot again, but the memory stuck with me.

So, back to 2024...

I don't have running shoes, and didn't want to have to obtain another pair. 

I also know that walking up a hill is lower-impact on the body than a level surface or down a hill.

I also know that walking on grass is lower-impact than walking on asphalt, concrete, or dirt. It's gentle on the skin.

So, I figured if I ran, and even _sprinted_, with a strong body position, _up a hill_, _on grass_, _while barefoot and on the balls of my feet_, and went only short distances, while doing _lots_ of walking or standing around, I might not injure my back, and might find it [interesting enough](({{ site.baseurl  }}{% link _posts/2021-02-18-driven-by-compression-progress.md %})). 

I was right. It was all sorts of interesting, enjoyable, peaceful. I'm calling this 'sprinting', but it also involved plenty of 'meandering back from whence I sprinted at a very, very leisurely pace'.

I started with a short distance and a gentle but fast run. More than ten paces, probably less than 20, usually only the distance I could run while holding a single breath, or maybe two, because breathholding and nasal breathing. It's a hold-over, always-running script in my brain. Ensuring I'm breathing through my nose, and sometimes holding my breath, or breathing in a very controlled way. 

Sprint sprint sprint, then walk, lazily, back to where I began, then walk around a little more, then sprint sprint sprint, repeat. It is vanishingly rare that I begin a sprint while still breathing hard, at all, from the prior sprint, and I usually let plenty of time elapse _after_ my breath has all the way slowed down again. 

That was the routine, and it's been extremely rewarding.

### These "sprints" vs. distance running

I'm appreciating how uneasy I am naming things sometimes, and 'sprints' is making me uneasy. It's emphasizing the wrong thing. Alas.

So much about the experience compares/contrasts with running. I like easy things, and tend to do more of something if it's easy than if it's difficult. 

Here's ways this sprinting thing is easy:

It's barefoot, and I'm always close to where I start, so I can show up wearing 'regular' shoes, normal clothing, with a backpack, coffee, and more. Drop the bag, take off the outer layer of cloathing (i'll have shorts or leggings under my pants, pretty much all the time, in the winter), take off shoes and socks, fold it all neatly in the grass/under a tree and I'm ready to run.

TODO photo of pile

I started this in the winter in colorado, so there's plenty of sunny days, and as long as there's not snow on the ground, I'll run. I've run barefoot in as cold as like 21 degrees farenheight. Only because the sun was out, and there was no snow.

Again, much of the 'value' of the sprints to me isn't even the sprinting, it's the walking around on the ground barefoot. Sometimes it's cold, or the ground is wet in different ways. wet ground still counts as 'nice'. It's like a tiny little ice bath, when it's snow melt or recently frozen. Like I said, I prefer comfort, and I usually run in dry, warm grass, but there's a blob of trees where I run, and I sometimes interact with the shadow, which keeps ice/swow longer than the spot in the sun. 

The hill I run up is south-facing, and because it's sloped, water flows off it, so it dries out really quickly after snow, and becomes very usable very quickly, even when lots of the rest of the ground is covered with snow.

Having my backpack with water in it, coffee, coats, extra layers, makes it convenient even in the winter. Since I ride my scooter even in the cold, I'm accustomed to having a pair of leggings (that I can run in) under whatever pants I'm wearing that day anyway. 

I warm up by sometimes moving at a walking speed, but doing 'high knees' or doing a slow, 'in place' jump on each leg. It can look sorta like skipping. It can 'build' towards you doing something that looks like running through thigh-deep water. 

My goal was always to simply stress enough that I'd feel it the next day, _on the bottoms of my feet_. It wasn't an aerobic workout, it wasn't a leg workout. I'll never forget how much a 2-mile barefoot run did me in, when I let myself run barefoot with my normal distance running form, in high school.

The first session I did a low number of trips up the hill and back, I stopped while I felt fine and fresh, and I reflected 'this small amount of movement is still more than I've had for a while'. It felt great, and as importantly, felt great the next day. Since I was at the park again anyway, throwing frisbee with a friend, I did some more 'sprints' up the hill. 

I'm a curiosity-driven person, I don't know if that comes across as why these sprint things are so interesting to me. 

Eventually, I started jogging slowly back to the start, sometimes, and immediately would sprint again. Or I'd walk back, walk some more, walk even more, stand stationary for a bit, and then sprint again. 

After my sprints, to continue with the theme of applying impulse to the balls of my feet, I would/will hop on the balls of my feet, bouncing with two feet a few times and then landing firmly on one foot, to try to catch as much force as I could on each side. I could feel the gentle soreness the next day, always. 

I'd always evaluate how I felt _the next day_, and never pushed anything 'hard' or 'got worked' or anything, still have not, in any particular session.



Some people would mention running barefoot where there are dogs. 

Usually dogs pee and poop (and it gets cleaned up) along the main walking paths, not the middle of nowhere. Since I'd run/re-run the same spot of ground, I get a sense for how clean it was. The vast majority of the sessions, I see zero shits. Sometimes I see one/more dog piles and avoid them. If I wanted I might bring bags and clean them, but it's not been an issue. The whole surface gets cleaned regularly by the dew cycle every day, then by baking in the sun, or getting snow and then melting. 

It feels so good in the balls of my feet, the arches, calves, supporting structures. I have found tons of interestingness in the simple observation and sensation of the soreness. 

I don't count things, either. I don't count reps, steps, distance, time. I start when my breath is still and slow, and I usually stop before it's much more than 'slightly elevated'. 

It feels so nice getting sunshine on my skin (colorado, afterall) and grass, dirt, moisture on my feet. My body feels _so good_, months later. SO GOOD! 

I've been doing kettlebell swings throughout, too. Sometimes on days I'd run I'd skip the swings. When there's snow out and I don't sprint, I'm vastly likely to do some kettlebell swings. Often I'll do both, because both the park and the gym is 'right on the way' for me, to many places. The park is close enough I can walk there, or I'll take my scooter and convert a 12 minute walk to a 4 minute scoot.

My brain and mood enjoy the experience. I'll often take a frisbee and text my normal frisbee throwing friend, and he'll sometimes join me for some frisbee tossing. I might frisbee before, during, or after the sprints. 

I've done these sprints with Eden. We were walking through cheesman already, she was asleep in the jogger, so I parked her jogger where I usually sprint, and did the running right next to it. Then tom met me for some frisbee, we tossed for a while, then Eden woke up and was ready to depart, so we did. Shockingly peaceful, full of ease, effortlessness.

It's nice to not spend a single dollar on traditional running gear.

I don't like the impact of doing anything on asphalt, and I won't run on a road that is cambered, because it feels like it's gotta be devestating to one's body, to run across a slope like that. I don't have to deal with cars, in this sprinting thing, either, and I don't hear any engines nearby, unlike running on a road.

When visiting a partner, and doing these sprints, I modified it to run in the playing field of a school nearby. It was all fine, by the way. I still prefer to run up a hill, but it works on a level surface too. 

The whole workout can be done in 5 minutes, or 25. Whatever I'm feeling. 

## Grand conclusions

I'm so aware of how some of my body functions as a box, some of it functions as a column. I'm aware of holding tension/stiffness/position through my whole body, my climbing feels _better_. way better. My shoulders feel strong, my fingers feel strong, my core feels strong.

I feel light on my feet when walking around. 

I still do not like to train, don't think it'll change, thrilled that with almost zero time I get so much. The sprinting is also 'walk barefoot in the grass in a park in the sun' which is just... nice, no matter how you evaluate it. 

Sometimes I listen to something, sometimes I have earplugs in and can only hear my own breath. 

I feel light on the wall. 

the one-arm swings + sprints helped me feel the intense usage of arms/shoulder girdle/the sides/front/back/bottom of the 'box' of my core. (Do not neglect the bottom of the box of the core! Kegles!)



## Update from 2 weeks after drafting the above

I'm still quite pleased. I did some large walks on concrete, amidst some of the prior exercise, and I felt much stronger, most of the time, than usual. I think it would have been too many miles if I hadn't been getting stronger.

I did two seven-mile days and a five mile day, all back to back.

I got a slight over-use tendon sensitivity on one of my feet. There was, and to a much lesser degree still is, pain around the movement of lifting my right toe, entirely coherent with a regular walking motion. I modified my gait a little, when it was really bad, and didn't use it until it felt mostly better, and I've been easing back into using it. It was hurting quite appreciably for a few days, and now five days later it's still delicate and I retain some of my accommodations. Sooo I wish I hadn't done that to myself. There was a day after the big huge days of walking where I thought "hmm, this feels like it is damaged" and I went on a bit more of a barefoot walk in Cheesman than I wish I had. That night is when I realized it was pretty sensitive. The toe looks/feels like a bruise along the top of it, close to what it would feel like if the nail had been beaten into the nail bed (like after a long run, something I experienced often enough marathon training).

Truly, this is the only pain of substance I've experienced. All the rest of the pain has been pain of _interest_, where I note slight sensitivities and sorenesses as I move around, in certain ways, body positions, motions, and it's all, still, interesting. I appreciate how I've felt pleasent stress inside of my knee, the tops of the shin bones. Feels like I'm building stronger knees and ankles.

The sprints _still feel worthwhile_, and the time walking/bounding barefoot continues to be time very well spent.

The kettlebells, a few notes:

- some gyms have kettlebells that have sorta rough, textured handles. The high-to-me weights are rough on the skin of my hands, even with smooth handles, and some kettlebell handles are too rough for me to feel comfortable with the swings. I could feel myself trying to accommodate it somehow and it was hurting, so I did a lot less reps. The skin at the base the fourth finger always gets pulled by the kettlebell, picks up callouses that have never torn but have sometimes felt close. Ideal kettelbell handles look like brushed metal, polished smooth. Don't forget the chalk.
- I'm still getting lots out of the one-armed swings. I've now done both lower-weight higher rep one-arm swings, and higher-weight lower-rep schemes. It's all been [interesting]({{ site.baseurl  }}{% link _posts/2021-02-18-driven-by-compression-progress.md %}) to me, which is good enough. It continues to feel deeply supportive of strong climbing.
- I'm sorta annoyingly _still_ telling lots of people about this strange magic that helps my back feel great, and everything else too. If you've read 1/3rd of this article, you've probably spent as long reading as the total kettlebell workout would take you. 

My fingers and hands feel nice. I'm not surprised, as often-enough I've felt profoundly sore in the small muscles inside my hands themselves, and all over the upper body. Shoulders and 'shrugging' motions, feeling strong, and my back. 

I am really curious for someone else to replicate this, doing lots of heavy two handed kettle bell swings, and eventually trying one-handed (heavy) kettlebell swings. I did one arm swings recently with 65 lbs, which is like 48% of my bodyweight. Heaviest I've done yet, and felt 'lighter' than the first time I tried 55 lb one-armed swings. My form and posture keeps getting better, and have I mentioned I feel a bit stronger?

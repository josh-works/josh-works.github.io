In late 2016, I [wrote a piece called 'I Quit']({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2016-10-24-i-quit.md %} ), where I outlined my reasons for stepping off social media.

I was "gone" from social media for about a year, during which I made almost no use of Twitter or Instagram, but I stayed active on Reddit, and I still had access to more than a few feeds and news aggregators, which attended to.

I've spent the last few months slowly culling distraction and interruption from my environment a second time, by applying lessons gained from my first pass, and mixing in some new ideas as well.

My efforts to minimize distraction spill across a few domains, but primarily will focus on cutting out distraction when on my computer, and on my phone. Obviously, this is about my approach to these topics. Your milage may vary, as you might not struggle at all with wasting time on digital distractions. Or you'll waste more time on digital distractions.

I'm hoping that somewhere in here, something will be of value to you.

## On whose terms?

We are entertained by our devices. A cell phone or laptop can help one pass hours and hours of time, but with little good to show for it.

Even when we're "passive consumers" of media, we're being influenced by it. No living thing is _stable_ in any meaningful way - we're shaping and being shaped by the world around us every day.

My rule of thumb is:

> If I'm not shaping something, I'm being shaped by it.

alternatively:

> If I'm not intentional in how I interact with the world around me, my interactions default to those preferred by the counter-party in the interaction.

Facebook/Instagram is a great example.

> If you are not intentional in how you interact with Facebook/Instagram, your interaction is determined by their "user engagement" team.

Engage in the world around you on your terms, or someone else's.


Phone:

- Delete apps that you use when bored.
- Disable browser
- Android? Remove news feed (screenshots/gifs)
- How do you know when you've succeeded? When you don't look at your phone when bored
- Texting/Whatsapp - I'm not helpful here. I don't use either app much, and have most of my group whatsapp convos muted.

Add one, maybe two apps:

- Anki
- Phone tracker, to see how much time you spend on various apps.

Computer

- Link to uBlock post
- Use RSS instead of feeds (feedly)

Twitter (I might kills this)

- unfollow everyone
- slowly re-follow people as you decide to

Facebook

- Delete your account for a week. Decide how it feels.
- Delete it for a month
- Delete it for a year
- Permanently delete it, have FB delete your data from their servers

Instagram

- unfollow (almost) every one



## What to do with all of this extra time?

There's lot of things you can do with your extra time. Here's a few suggestions:

#### Be bored

I'm not kidding in the slightest. Google "benefits of being bored", and be convinced.

A few weeks ago, I wandered into a restaurant and placed an order for carry-out. Since I'd not placed the order ahead of time, I just sat in a chair and waited while the food was prepared. _I didn't feel the slightest desire to pull my phone out_, and instead, sat in the chair, letting my brain mull over whatever it wanted to, while watching other people eat, order, come and go, etc.

I considered how unusual I may have looked (though I know it's unlikely that anyone even noticed me) sitting there, _not_ looking at my phone.

> What's wrong with him? Why isn't he on his phone? Maybe the battery is dead, poor guy. Or maybe he's a sociopath, looking for his next victim.

It's not normal to not be on your phone when you have time to kill. Be abnormal.

#### Read a book

I hope, before you do anything crazy like the above steps, you install the PhoneUsage app, to see how much time you spend on your phone.

Half of that time could easily be rolled into reading a book. There's many great books to read. Get started.

#### Talk to your significant other

They're worth talking to, right? Ask them questions. See what they're thinking about. Highs and lows of the day. Observe the world around you, comment on it together.

[Respond to their "requests for connection"](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/06/happily-ever-after/372573/), because that's one of the greatest predictors of a lasting relationships.

#### Memorize stuff

When I was in Turing, I spent a lot of time building and studying programming-related flashcards. But I have a "secret" list of flashcards that almost no one knows about.

That secret list? It's a list of flashcards called "people". Historically, I've been _horrible_ at remembering people's names. I found it embarrassing and awkward. Not just people that I encountered occasionally, but I'd often have difficulty remembering people's names that I set beside almost every day in college, or who lived just a few doors down from me.

I perceived the cost of getting a name wrong to be so high I would just stop using people's names unless I was 100% sure of it. And I was almost never 100% sure.

So, once I was using Anki to augment learning programming, I added a deck for people. One one side would be a little about the person, or where I tend to see them, and on the back would be their name. (I tend to always remember the details I know about someone, and the context in which we met them, and often even what we talked about, just not their name. So, using those as "clues" is more than sufficient for building a card.)

It's a bit odd, but you can also try to snag pictures of the people, and use that as the clue. Honestly, this doesn't work as well for me as just using things I know about them from when we first met.

Now, I've gone from "the guy who never remembers people's names" to "the guy who has a shockingly good memory for names". My memory hasn't changed, just my process.

### How to read this document

This document builds on existing context. Bare minimum, you should watch episode 3 of cheer. Ideally, you'd watch the first three episodes of Cheer.

Before you keep reading, take a moment to go watch the trailer:

### Cheer | Official Trailer | Netflix 

[![Cheer trailer on Youtube](https://p64.f2.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/yAuYX91z/Image%202020-06-03%20at%209.17.21%20AM.png?v=cf150abe2dfc6eab021997a2c47e3d81)

1. Minumum context: Watch episode 3 of cheer
2. Medium context: Watch episode 3 of cheer, _after_ also watching Episodes 1 and 2
3. Full context: Watch _the whole season_, and re-watch episode as needed to load up on context as this article unfolds.

If you don't have a Netflix subscription, consider getting a trial membership and cancelling after watching these episodes; I've sunk dozens of hours into this paper, I'm comfortable asking you to spend some money and time loading up context for what you're about to read. 

Incidentally, if I could spend double the time and expense that I've already spent, to double the liklihood thatt you will agree with my course of action by the end of this paper, I would gladly do so. 

# Why I started watching Cheer

Cheer is a Netflix documentary. Across six episodes at one hour each, it tells a story of a the current reigning champion cheer team based in an improbable small town in Texas. 

I expected, in watching the show, to hear and see discussed threads from different books I've read, and looked forward to seeing if my expectations would be correct, such as:

- In [Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26312997-peak), the author argues: _Generally, top performance is a function of learning and practice, not genetics, so you'd expect the best team in the world to form wherever the best coach in the world lived, because of that coach's influence._
- [Playing to Win: Becoming the Champion](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18171.Playing_to_Win): _To win, one must have a deep understanding of the rules, and one will win in a very technical, precise manner._
- I'm loosely familiar with the intersection of young professional rock climbers and social media. Some competative climbers [write about ditching instagram and winning comps](https://crushclimbing.com/why-ditching-instagram-earned-me-the-podium/). Wondered if something similar might bubble up in cheerleading. 
- I wondered if any of the athlets would explicitly mention [this study where professional sports teams improved their performances by getting off social media](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2019/04/11/digital-minimalism-and-sports/), which is the basic prrescription of books by Cal Newport, like [Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work) and [Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40672036-digital-minimalism).

I ended up getting _so much more than I'd planned_ out of the show.

### First half

A deep dive into this single episode of Cheer

### Second Half

We flip the mirror around, and look at _us_ and our role in what we saw in Cheer. 


# Important Characters

Episode 3 focuses on several characters, who I'll introduce briefly in a moment.

1. TT
2. La'Darius
3. Monica
4. Sherbs
5. Gabby
6. Jerry

I propose that in ways, we think of these kids as professionals, with conmensurate grit, determination, attention to detail, etc.

In other ways, these kids are oppressed by entire systems in such a systematic and interlocking way that _nearly nothing can be done about it_. 

I hope to do two things in this essay:

1. Show you the exact ways in which these kids are oppressed by systems, and the ways that there is almost _nothing_ anyone can do to try to change those systems.
2. Show you that a very small group (composed of the ~5 individuals reading this essay) is equipped to do something about this, and in a way that is more effective than every other possible means of improving the situation. 

### Cheer S1E3: Blood, Sweat, and Cheers

In the event you don't watch all three episodes, or have watched them all and forgotten some bits, I'll fill in some context for you.

Lets get a quick introduction to some of the key characters. I'll introduce them now, and re-fresh as they come into the episode chronologically:

# Monica Aldama, Head Coach

![monica_aldama.jpg](https://p64.f2.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/YEupG4WJ/Image%202020-06-03%20at%209.17.46%20AM.png?v=58a92e1c61812844952a7a963ac40f48)

Monica as the coach. Extremely driven. She wants to win, wants to be the best in the nation, and has won most of the last 20 cheer competitions. _She is extremely talented and capable_.

She cares deeply for the individuals on her team, but let me say it again - she is _relentless_ in her desire and plans to win. Critically, Monica and Novarro Cheer _lost_ in 2017.

Monica's husband, talking about what happened when Monica last lost her last annual Cheer competition, which was I believe meant [she lost the 2017 season](https://navarrocollege.edu/cheer/).

> That was Monica's hardest loss. She thought she gave EVERYTHING, and for all that work to go down the drain because she felt like we were not prepared enough, that's why she constantly prepares us."


To build tension at the end of Episode 2, we learned of Monica's "alter ego" that comes out when she's _pissed_:

> Monica has this, like, alter ego, and we call her Annette. She does crazy stuff.

> Everyone was always like _do not bring out annette_.

> Don't make the bad side of Monica come out

> Losing last year ate [the coach] up!

> That's Monica, when like someone is disrespectful towards her, is not listening to her, or does something wrong. Anybody that is in her way, you just don't want to see that side of Monica. She gets scary.

Enough witth context. On to Episode 3, which _rocked_ me, when I watched it. 

# Episode 3: _Blood, Sweat, and Cheers_

We'll proceed more-or-less chronologically through the episode. I'll drop timestamps where appropriate. 

I'm going to try to convey a sense of how much is happening behind the scenes, in terms of power dynamics between various individuals and groups, and this sense of the power dynamics is tied up in all the reading of _The Power Broker_ I've done over the last six months.

### TT Barker: Navarro Cheerleader, Stunter

![a picture of TT Barker](https://p64.f2.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/kpu51lOn/Image%202020-06-03%20at%209.18.05%20AM.png?v=7ef0ea68a011e9256ab1dd1c46a21dfe)

TT: got injured while competing over the weekend, on another team, which is against Monica's rules.

Monica, saying, you perform hard elsewhere, you perform hard here:

> What you do there, you do here

cut to Monica's exposition of what happened: 
> He injured himself competing elsewhere this weekend. I didn't want him to injure himself further, and thats when we discussed that he should not compete the next day, cuz I didn't think it would be in his best interests. Then he did, for whatever reason.

Now Monica's punishing him by making him go "full out", which means "practice the event at full speed/impact". **A full-out has a high likelihood of injury for TT**, in TT's words and the words of the athletic trainer.

Cameron Hieb, head athletic trainer, told TT to "not do anything". Monica is overriding the on-site medical professional, in order to mete out punishment.

TT says "I am screwed".

Monica:

> You don't just go and do something at all-star practice if you can't do the same thing at our practice. You don't get to pick and choose. 
> 
> They get scholarships at Navarro College. This is their first priority, and they know that from the beginning. 

If this wasn't being done "for college", this entire dynamic would look very different, right?

Scene contines, Monica's calling "ok, everyone, full out!"

Every motion TT takes has him on the ground, showing extremely high degrees of physical pain. 

![tt_injured_01.jpg](https://p64.f2.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/jkuQgRAq/Image%202020-06-03%20at%209.18.17%20AM.png?v=f63d8fb0e6cd7f1748e85a3e0e47a127)


![tt_injured_02.jpg](https://p64.f2.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/04uYGv6W/Image%202020-06-03%20at%209.18.27%20AM.png?v=4ff633fb069e20d1e0ad52009f80c9be)

If your instinct here is to blame Monica for abusing her team, please, join me as we go down the rabbit hole. 

Monica's husband:

> She's hard on 'em. She's hard on the kids because they represent her and they represent the college.
> 
> Competition, lets face it, we're all here to win, so... if you're not giving your best, then you're going to have a problem with monica. 

This entire scene (about 1 minute) keeps cutting back to TT performing stunts, and sobbing quietly in pain. 


A few minutes later, we learn more about TT. I'm mentioning it here to highlight the contrast between how TT feels for Monica (very warmly) and how Monica is treating TT (very poorly):

Back to TT:

Now the athletic trainer says:

> I told you to not go full-out, TT. You don't listen.

TT isn't the problem. Monica's the problem. She's intentionally punishing TT, and she's OK with him getting further injured to make her point.

TT and La'Darious disagree over how much practice is appropriate:

La'Darius: 
> this time last year, we did not practice this hard. 

TT: 
> Well do you want to win or do you want to lose?

La'Darius: 
> at this point, I don't even care. 

So, at some level, La'Darius is open to opting out of the team. He doesn't care about winning, or at least states that he doesn't. 

> They don't act like they know how to take care of people, their freaking team

He makes an excellent point. Monica and crew does _not_ care for her team. 

The team exists to further Monica's aspirations. Benefit that accrues to the team members themselves is incidental and of secondary importance, but _even with the lack of need for her to care about her team, she's coaching them in a way that drastically increases likelihood of injury, burnout, psychological distress._

I doubt that Michael Phelp's coach would be retained as Phelp's coach, if he treated Phelps like this _and got Phelps injured right before the Olympics_. 


TT:
> Monica's not even like a second mom, she's basically like a first mom. I would literally do anything for her.

TT _loves_ Monica. Monica is exploiting TT. This is brutal. 

-----------------------------------------------------

### Mackenzie "Sherbs" Sherburn: Navarrow Cheerleader, Top Girl/Flier

![Mackenzie "Sherbs" Sherburn picture](https://p64.f2.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/4guj0XX1/Image%202020-06-03%20at%209.18.42%20AM.png?v=dfa36e1026d72c5d60a825c8a7dea57c)

We're introduced to "Sherbs" Sherburn, talking about repeated rib injury, while doing makeup before practice. 

The viewers don't know this yet, but the episode will end with Sherbs falling from the top of a pyramid, not getting caught correctly, and causing substantial damage to her elbow, _and will be out of competition for the rest of the season._

Here's the injury we see at the end of the episode:

![injury cropped](https://josh.works/images/sherbs-injury.gif)

_Gif of Sherbs getting injured. Visit [josh.works/cheer](https://josh.works/cheer) to view the live gif_

Repeated themes from the cheer team: 

> Monica is hard on us, but it's because she loves us, wants us to be the best. We want to be the best, so we trust her and follow her instructions.

----------------------------------------------------

So, we've now met Monica, we've met TT, we've met Sherbs, who will suffer a significant injury at the end of the season, and now we meet La'Darius.

## La'Darius Marshall: Navarrow Cheerleader, Stunter/Tumbler

![ladarius.jpg](https://p64.f2.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/12uNxkjJ/Image%202020-06-03%20at%209.20.03%20AM.png?v=3636dc9891c8d3a621152afc4708ab88)

Scene cuts to La'Darius making a mistake on a stunt, and walking away, frustrated.

Here's the stunt he's trying to "hit", and failing:

![ladarius stunt miss](https://josh.works/images/cheer-ladarius-stunt.gif)

_The above is a gif. If you're reading a printed version of this, apologies. Visit [josh.works/cheer](https://josh.works/cheer) to view the live gif._

A few people pile on on how he handled it. 

Monica not-so-subtly threatens him with not being inclued "on the mat" if he doesn't fix his act. 

The episode continues talking about La'Darius' background, _which is heartbreaking_. 

His mother in and out of jail, no father in the picture. 

Raised by his grandma, and two brothers who "tried to beat [La'Darius] into a man". Extensive physical and sexual abuse from friends and family.

Repeatedly, paraphrasing:

> He has been through so much. We know so much of what he's been through, and that _isn't everything he's been though_. His emotions, they're all over the place. You don't know what all he's been though. 

La'Darius: 
> I wanted to be the best in every aspect... I wanted to prove myself that I was man enough to do this.


Monica says:

> You know, sometimes, you can have the most talented kid, but if they're not coachable or they're not a good teammate, then they cause problems, and it's -- it's just not worth it.

*Monica's attitude bothers me. The problem is not "he's not coachable", it's that _he is rejecting the way he's being treated, and is being punished for that rejection_*



------------------------------------

# Academics

The episode cuts to the cheer team studying in the library. They are college students, after all. 

La'Darius: 
> We just don't get enough time in the day to do all this work. Everybody's like "School comes first", and then they're like "but Navarro is your priority". 
>
> OK, so which one comes first?
>
> Because I've got a test right now, and I've got practice. 
> You're making me run [dispensing physical punishment] for not going to class, but you don't want me to miss tests to go to practice.
> 
> I'm confused.

Now we meet Kapena, assistant coach, who recently graduated from Navarro, was a member of the cheer team, _and_ got good grades while in college

### Kapena Kea, Navarro Cheer: Student Assistant Coach

![kapena.jpg](https://p64.f2.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/yAuYXz6w/Image%202020-06-03%20at%2010.02.31%20AM.png?v=6bf40c554ac190a4d31b723d2b5fbc78)

Kapena (one of the coaches):

> We run for tardiness or absences. Monica cares about our grades.
>
> She's such a stickler on grades, which is why she hired me to be the tutor, because she cares so much. I have good grades, I have a 4.0
>
> I fill out [the team's] schedules, I help them get a planner. 

Now, we cut to seeing Kapena help students.

He's helping one of the cheerleaders with _music appreciation_. Why would a professional athelete need music appreciation? Does Michael Phelps have mandatory Music Appreciation classes? 

Kapena, on the phone with someone else:

> I'm gonna help Lexi right now. Her Music Appreciation [course]. She said she doesn't know what instrument makes what sound.

If you were tempted to laugh at this, and think "wow, Lexi doesn't know what instrument makes what sound" _you are missing the point of this essay, and I implore you to keep reading_. 

Lexi:
> I don't know anyone else that's in this stupid class, and I don't understand this crap.

These are the words of someone who is either:

1. Not trying to better themselves
2. Deeply frustrated with the state of affairs, and is generally trustworthy in seeking out opportunities to improve oneself.


Who's Lexi? Great question. Here she is, studying the "crap" that is her mandatory Music Appreciation class:

![lexi studying](https://p64.f2.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/YEupGwBd/Image%202020-06-03%20at%2010.04.07%20AM.png?v=428b6638e8ba3b6a6e77dde6879d323f)

She's also one of the top female athletes lets _in the nation_. 

Go check out [this Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/BiacFIpFLDe/) of her tumbling, or visit [josh.works/cheer](https://josh.works/cheer) to view it live. 

OK, onward. 

Tis is where I, the author, feel obligated to mention that I have _failed_ several classes, both in high school and college. I didn't get my diploma when I walked across the stage for college graduation, I got a "provisional diploma". Why? _Because I failed a class my last semester_, and my "graduation" was provisional upon me getting extra credits. 

I signed up for an online english literature class at my community college, spent about an hour on the entire course, got an A, and "graduated college". It seemed to me that if _the academic institution itself_ didn't take academics seriously, I sure wasn't going to.

I was told, repeatedly, "college is a game, and you have to play the game". If it's a game, for these Navarro cheer kids, it's a game in the same way that being a gladiator in a Roman colliseum "is a game". They're sacrificing _their lives_ to this game, this system. 

Next, in the episode, the cheer team is getting a presentation from a school administrator:

![academics.jpg](https://p64.f2.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/OAuBKZ6w/Image%202020-06-03%20at%2010.04.32%20AM.png?v=f3f3c0c3a55c169f0b49109275296f11)

> You may or may not know, but we started a new initiative this past fall to reward our student athletes that have a 3.0 grade point average for the previous semester. You get to brag a little bit, and you get a T-shirt.

If I were to paraphrase this into slightly less-flattering words:

> We expect you to spend dozens of scarce hours satisfying arbitrary and known-useless requirements, and in return, we will "reward" you with something that has _zero_ value. 

You, the viewer, should bristle at this. Is it any wonder these kids seem (at times) bitter and frustrated?

Now we meet Jerry Harris. He wins this academic contest, with a certain number of hours studied, and earned a 4.0:

![jerry.jpg](https://p64.f2.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/xQuD4ow7/Image%202020-06-03%20at%2010.04.56%20AM.png?v=27bcb953d06ed328386399299a83c2b6)

This would be like a law firm saying:

> We've decided to start issuing bonuses for our lawyers who are also accomplished chefs and who cook all their meals at home. 

1. The cooking is entirely disconnected from performance in the job
2. Proficiency in cooking _detracts_ from time spent performing the job, or resting/recovering _from_ the job.

Jerry's academic achievements:
1. Do not improve his cheer performance
2. Detracts from his cheerleading performance
3. Props up a failing institution (American higher education)
4. Encourages other equally idealistic-but-trapped individuals to also participate in a failing institution
5. That institution won't actually fail as long as it can keep parasitically sucking money out of those it claims to serve. 

I'm telegraphing where I'm going with this whole essay, but wanted to slip it in:

_I would expect Jerry could go to Turing and be a very successful software developer. He'd be making $75k/yr immediately, and >$100k/yr within 3 years of graduating. Why not just send him to Turing, instead of breaking his body and soul?_

Despite the tone of this essay, I don't have any problems with Monica, or Kapena, or Navarro as an institution. Everyone is doing the best they can, with the constraints available to them, and trying to improve the world for themselves and those around them. 

I *do* have a problem with the lack of consent from these kids. They are being repeatedly reminded that they have options besides being on this cheer team, so they should act like they want to be here, but for systemic reasons, _these kids have no other options_. They're more akin to hostages than students.

The episode continus to touch on the size of the cheer team's social media followings. I'm not even going to discuss this dynamic and complexity, as it would be a long rabbit trail and not move us closer to our goals. 


--------------------------------

Jerry is currently "winning" the global media circuit.He's making guest appearences on TV shows, doing sponsored product endorsements, and more. We'll expand on this in a few pages. 

In 2019, when this show was being filmed? He wasn't a public figure then. He _had no power_. 

La'Darius and TT, both of who are (in my view) being exploited by systems and people around them, can be _brutal_ towards other equally-exploited people:

A few minutes later in the episode, we see La'Darius and TT picking on Jerry

> We're better than you. You're beneath us. We're better than you, Jerry. So be quiet. 

Does Jerry know that he was worth and dignity as a person, _independent of other people's views of him_? 

------------------------------

Back to La'Darius, and him "rebelling" against Monica's coaching style. He misses another stunt, and is angered by it.

Justin ([insta](https://www.instagram.com/justinbouvierr/?hl=en)) lecturing the team, again, about "attitude", but really he's talking to La'Darius (at least as it's presented in the show). 

Just another privaleged white guy lecturing a poor black man. 🙄

![white man lectures](https://p64.f2.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/o0uvNLAe/Image%202020-06-03%20at%2010.08.03%20AM.png?v=c3d54b3b46b8fb7583d79d27999d761c)

> Attitude is everything. so if you don't wanna be here, there's the door. Because I guarantee you, there's far more people that would love to be in your spot right now, and we're not fighting to get second. We have a legacy to uphold. If you don't wanna be here, there's the door. 

Feels like how labor exploitation generally works.

> Someone else would love to get paid what you're getting paid, and would endure what you're enduring, so if you're not up to it, get out and I'll bring in someone else.

A white person saying this to a black person, when that black person _has every reason to be pissed with the conditions they're "working" in_, is ironic at best, and really is a reflection of systemic injustice 

Monica is admitting, straight up, that La'Darius has "an attitude problem".

No shit. He's rebelling, with every tool in his toolbox, against the situation he's found himself in. 

This is a power game. His power on the team comes from him being _the best they have_ and the team needs him. This isn't actually _that_ powerful of a position, because in any situation, the person likely to come out ahead is the person with the strongest BATNA ([Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_alternative_to_a_negotiated_agreement)).

La'Darius' BATNA is 💩:

If he quits the team, he loses everything. His community, his structure, his friends, his life. He doesn't have a fall-back plan. What job would he get? How would he put a roof over his head?

Monica's BATNA is strong. She can swap him out with anyone else, and she has access to a deep pool of labor that is undifferentiated from La'Darius, other than the fact that _no one else is quite as good as he is_. So, her need to win is the only thing that gives La'Darius leverage over her. 

A book by the title [Exit, Voice, and Loyalty: Responses to Decline in Firms, Organizations, and States](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/149033.Exit_Voice_and_Loyalty) is relevant here. La'Darius perceives a "decline in the institution" in the way he's being treated, but **Exit** is a bad option. He's _trying_ to exercise **Voice**, but because of his lower power, voice is inneffective. He's finally forced into **Loyalty**. 

La'Darius is in a very precarious position. If he had a good fallback plan, he'd "nope" right out of the team, perhaps jumping ship to an equally-competative team that treats its players better, _and then Monica would possibly have to make the structural changes to the program that would make this a more sustainable and healthy team if she wanted him back_. 

As is, his precarious position allows her to keep using the power differential to basically beat him into submission, using Jerry as "the stick". 

La'Darius is worse off. Jerry is used. Monica gets what she's always had, and always wanted: the best cheer team in the nation, _and she's immune to external forces that might have forced her to change_. 

------------------------------

La'Darius misses another stunt. 

He's within his rights to be missing them - he's overworked, forced to spend scarce hours prioritizing waste-of-time academics, and feels under-supported by Monica. He _desperately_ needs counseling, too. Remember his childhood?

He's also _capable_ of doing the stunts correctly, but only if he wants to. How do you get top-fraction-of-a-percent performance out of someone? It's not by beating it out of them, you have to _draw_ it out of them.

We've all heard the "joke":

> The beatings will continue until morale improves

We all look at the phrase and laugh. 

Why would someone submit to being beat, until their morale improves? _Because they have no alternative option_.

22:00, Monica chews out La'Darius _in front of the entire team_:

![monica_chewing_out_ladarius.jpg](https://p64.f2.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/p9uPp2yX/Image%202020-06-03%20at%2010.09.02%20AM.png?v=0c9391483b5a8d2afc03607609a825fa)

> Do I need to take you off [the mat]? Because you're not even trying [on the stunt].

She's flexing on him - she can take away the thing that is most important to him. _This is how abusive situations develop_. 

Someone tries to stick up for La'Darius, and Monica snaps at him:

> You, be quiet. Do you hear me? Don't say another word. Stay in your lane, and stay the hell out of this

![public_for_me_but_not_for_thee.jpg](https://p64.f2.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/p9uPp29X/Image%202020-06-03%20at%2010.09.20%20AM.png?v=8d692a49b1884232c94af7b0d5ca22d8)

No, Monica, he/she shouldn't _stay the hell out of this_ because they see this for the abusive power dynamic it is, or at least can intuit that something's not right and La'Darius is being mis-treated. 

Monica wants to chew La'Darius out in public, in order to put pressure on him, but doesn't want "the public" to respond to what she's telling him.

Next, Monica says something that seems so innoculous.

> Jerry, try that stunt with Sherbs

But she really just dropped the hammar on La'Darius, doubling down on the power dynamic. She's demonstrating to him that his BATNA is trash, _and they both know it_. 

She's saying 

> Watch our team succeed without you, La'Darius. We can succeed without you. _You have no power over me_.

A few things:
1. La'Darius' valid concerns and comments are ignored
2. Jerry gets _everything he's ever wanted_ dangled in front of him, but Monica has no plans to ever give it to him.
3. Jerry's being used, to threaten La'Darius.


Both Jerry and La'Darius have no alternative to this team. Monica cares about them only as for as they advance her interests. She's a powerful white woman, lording her power over powerless black men, both of whom feel extremely high allegance to her, and consider her as a mother to them.

Jerry and La'Darius cannot both come out well in this situation. Monica comes out fine regardless. Two poor black men, now pitted against each other, basically trying to prove that they're more willing to put up with the abuse. 

Jerry is trying hard. He's unpracticed in this exact stunt with this exact partner. He's ironing out the kinks. 

La'Darius is watching, no doubt feeling _exactly_ what Monica wants him to feel. Threatened. 

Jerry does OK. Obviously struggling a bit, but that's reasonable. He's not done the stunt before, not practiced. He's estatic. 

Now Monica says to the team

> I'm going to be reevaluating things, so tomorrow we'll figure it out.

This isn't even a veiled threat to La'Darius. She's simply reminding him of her power.

She's going to let him try again, he's going to try his best to out-perform Jerry, knowing that if he keeps rebelling, it'll cost him his spot on the team. La'Darius knows that Monica doesn't want Jerry in, she wants him, and this is a big game of chicken. 

It comes down to the person with the best BATNA. His sucks. Hers is fine. Without watching any more of the episode, we can predict what will happen. La'Darius backs down, will accept the conditions and injustice, and Monica will carry on, using La'Darius' skills and talent to achieve what she wants - another national victory. 

The whole team generally seems very supportive of Jerry, and encourages him. I don't know if they know that he's not going to be kept "on mat" or not. I'm inclined to think that most people see what is happening, but Jerry's enthusiasm for being "on mat" is so inspiring and encouraging that everyone kinda hopes he can stay on mat.

Morgan tells Jerry she's so proud of him. These athelets care for each other in a way that Monica doesn't.

Gabby tells Jerry she's so proud of him. _Gabby is the #1 Cheerleader in the USA_. 

Monica, to the camera, is now back-filling the reasoning for how she's threatening La'Darius:

> It would be a huge change. They're two very different types of cheerleaders. Basically, I would need to start from the beginning, and redo the whole routine. But I'm not scared to make that decision if I have to.

or, "I'm not scared to make that decision if La'Darius is unwilling to do what I demand of him". 

She's saying she has a better BATNA than he, and she's comfortable with it.

> I can't have someone that's not trying their best, whatever their reasons are. My job is to make sure the team is at its best, and if there's a bad apple, it's gotta go. I don't want that for La'Darius, but that's potentially what could happen, and he would not be out there competing, even though he's technically one of the most talented ones on the team. 

Threats, threats, more threats, she's impervious to change, because _the power dynamic is such that she doesn't have to change_. If this situation doesn't sit right with you, take comfort knowing _there's no way it could go down any other way_. 

Jerry is estatic that he's "on the mat" right now.

Jerry and La'Darius share the same room. Monica's power moves is throwing both of their personal lives into turmoil, injecting lots of conflict into their relationship, because she's _using Jerry to threaten La'Darius_!!!

---------------------

La'Darius resiliance and efforts on Navarro is _incredible_.

He is high-power compared to his peers, but low-power compared to Monica.

This power differential is _systemic_, not acute. Anyone else in a similar spot to him would find themselves similarly victimized by systems and people around them.  

His life started with a really shitty roll of the dice. He fought so hard to scratch and crawl to the position he's got. Best athelete in the nation in his sport, _and he still doesn't have the power to defend himself against Monica_.

And Monica defends and loves her team to the best of her ability. But that care and love? it's tainted with the power dynamic. 

People are _whole_ people. It's not reasonable _or possible_ to detach your soul from your sport. He's the best in the nation at what he does, and Monica is telling him 
> your emotions don't matter, and your opinion on how you are being treated does not matter. _You as a person do not matter_. 

He matters. He has dignity and worth, by virtue of being a human. I wish he could hear this message from someone. 

-------------------

[timestamp/screenshot]

Next day, Andy, head coach under Monica, pulls La'Darius and Sherbs into a closet to have them work out their differences. 

Sherbs is the flyer (who gets badly injured in this episode), who he does the stunt that he keeps missing with. La'Darius basically blames her for missing the stunt, and possibly says other disparaging things about her to others. We, the viewer, cannot know what is true, but there is plenty of evidence we see elsewhere to support the idea that La'Darius can be petty and vindictive. 

If he and she keep missing the stunt, it's either her fault or his.

When La'Darius misses the stunt, he blames Sherbs. So Andy wants him and her to work out their differences, but _really_ the problem is between La'Darius and Monica, not La'Darius and Sherbs. 

Monica is making _Sherbs_ do the difficult emotional labor of repairing relationships on the team. This feels poisonous, destructive to the already-complicated inter-team relationships. We don't get to witness the conversation, but Sherbs indicates to Monica that it seems resolved.


-------------------

So, what's the result, the outcome, of Monica, by way of Sherbs, playing Chicken and calling La'Darius' bluff?

A few things happen:

1. La'Darius fully capitulates, recommitting himself to performing the stunt as well as he can. (In the framework from _Exit, Voice, and Loyalty_ he is _forced_ into **Loyalty**)
2. Monica, having achieved her goal, puts La'Darius back "on mat", making no concessions or capitulations to La'Darius.
3. Jerry, who's entire role in this exchange was to make Monica's threat credible, loses the thing he most wanted in life and is now "off mat", and _worse off than before_, as his hopes were elevated, and then crushed, in service of Monica's plans against La'Darius.
4. No one, not Monica, not Sherbs, not La'Darius, not Jerry, not Andy, no one can explicitely verbalize what just happened. 


La'Darius, being told by Monica that he's back on matt, tells Jerry that he's now off mat:

> Jerry, we have to switch [back to La'Darius being on Mat].

Jerry:

> That's what [Monica] said?
>
> OK. Fantastic. 

Here's Jerry's face, having his hopes crushed:

![jerry-losing-everything.jpg](https://p64.f2.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/4guj08p2/Image%202020-06-03%20at%2010.09.41%20AM.png?v=fba6d4ed22ff7ee3fa076beb03441ef5)

And just like that - Jerry's role is over. He was used to get La'Darius committed to doing his best, and... he's discarded. Just like that. 

Jerry knows exactly what happened. He explains why what just happened, happened. His hopes got up, then crushed. 

The fact that he plays it off so well, and presents this smiley, ethusiastic demeanor to the world, makes me nervous. It's quite plausible that façade covers deep depression, self-doubt, woundedness, and much more.

He doesn't have a way to express frustration and pain, _and the entire US Media establishment is profiting off his enduringly sunny disposition_. (More on this later). 

----------------------------

### Gaby's exploitation

Back to school.

[Timestamp]

Gaby:

> I hate school. Everyone's like "what's your major" and I'm like "cheerleading". 

Gaby sees the futility of college. She's more competant and savvy than most people in the world, why make her maintain the façade? 

Gaby's mom, Debbie Butler, profits off Gaby as much as anyone else does! Maybe more!

> Gaby's work-ethic is second to none. But she's not going to be one of those kids that in four years graduates with a degree. But that's okay, because Gabi has a career.

So why is Gaby stuck making _everying else_ rich? It feels like there's no one actually representing Gaby's interests, protecting her future income, encouraging her to make sound business decisions. The likeliest outcome is Gaby will fade from stardom in a few years, and be left trying to make an income by leading high-profile workshops at cheerleader training programs around the world, feeling increasingly the decline of health from punishing and ill-advised training regimens from Monica. 

If she had a reputable, trustworthy legal or financial advisor, I suspect this person could direct sponsorship dollars into long-term investments (like Vanguard's index fund [VTSAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VTSAX)) and she could have a steady stream of income, for the rest of her life, as a result of that initial investment. 

As it is, her mom and dad would take the money long before she ever sees it. I'm being uncheritable here. Maybe they actually are trustworthy and setting her up for life-long success. This good outcome is not implied at any point in the six episodes. 

She's getting hounded by her mom, her dad, her sister, for all her sponsorship and product lines and all that. 

> Gaby, why don't you do a give-away for the bikini blog? 

John, Gaby's dad, after Gabi's sister is trying to get her to promote their bikini line on Gaby's instagram:

> If you would just write the caption that you want her to use, and send her the picture, she'll post it. And if she won't do it, send it to me. I'll make sure she gets it done.

He's "her managing her career", and it "takes a tremendous amount of time, and it's made me rich" (ok, he didn't say that last part, but I'm not feeling charitible. 

Now he's chewing her out for "procrastinating on stuff". 

Next he's mansplaining her reasons for not doing it. 

Now Gabi explains how "bad comments" get in her head. 1000 good comments, 1 bad one, and the bad one gets into her head, and it messes with her. 

Fame is a mess. Gaby needs therapy and counseling, or, to call it something with less stigma, she needs "career coaching". 

----------------------------------------

# First full-out

This starts at the 45:00 mark. 

It's hard. The entire team looks so dead. They've not been rested.

You know how hard I climb after three days on? I'm at like 80%, best, and I know my liklihood of injury is higher. I'm not doing high-velocity stunts where a minor mistake can lead to catastrophic, rouinous injury. The worst injury I face when tired is damaging a finger tendon or straining a muscle. Not breaking my neck or arm or leg or back. 

Why does Monica crush these kids? She doesn't give 'em any time to rest. And not 24 hours, they need 3 days, and a break from the academics.

Gabi:

> I have no energy at all. [panting]. 

Monica, _as the team is lying on the ground exhausted, panting like race horses_:

> Some of y'all didn't throw your tumbling full-out. You need to go throw that right now while you're tired. that's part of the conditioning. 

Gabi is training right after the first full-out, Monica is _watching her injure herself_. 

Gabi puts extreme pressure on herself. Does stunts, tumbles, is hurting, limps off the mat:

![Gabi injured herself, limping off mat, while Monica encourages her to keep hurting herself.](https://p64.f2.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/KouBOkbb/Image%202020-06-03%20at%2010.10.38%20AM.png?v=6606a377becf8d4e47dc275ef3d5feb1)

Gaby has so much pressure on her. She's afraid of hurting herself, she's tired, she's injured, and _monica is piling even more shit on her_

Gabi, to Monica, addressing her performance:

> I feel like I'm more mental than I am physical right now. I'm thinking about it too much.

Monica:

> Way too much, and I think it's affecting what you're throwing.

Gabi:
> I don't really know if it's because I'm scared to fall...

Monica:
> Don't be scared to fall.

Gabi:
> I think the main thing is I just think about it too much. I'm in my head, like "Oh, I don't want to die", but...

Monica, laughing, scoffing:

> I don't want you to die.

Gabi: 

> I just have to get it out of my brain. To where I'm like "OK, if I fall, I'm just gonna fall and we're gonna.."

Monica:
> But you're not gonna fall, if you go 100%, that's what I'm saying. It's when you try to hold back, that's when you hurt your ankle. You have to build up your confidence.

... "build up your confidence" says the coach to one of the top Cheerleaders in the nation. I don't think _confidence_ is Gabi's problem. Her head and body are screaming that she's going to hurt herself, and Gaby thinks she needs to _ignore those signals_ in order to perform. 

Monica's point is true, by the way. If the kids go at 100%, it's plausible that risk of injury goes down, but Monica has over-worked them so far they're virtually guaranteed to not be able to do 100%. Their physical structures (joints, bones, soft tissue) are compromised by over-work, _and_ they're physically and mentally exhausted. No one can get close to 100%, they're probably barely at 80% of their max capacity at any given day._

The conclusion of the conversation, Gabi says:

> I promise I will not think as much

As this is all happening, and Monica is coaxing Gabi to ignore her sense of self-preservation to further a chance that Monica gets what Monica wants...

-------------------------------------------

La'Darius is lecturing the group for not trying their hardest:

![ladarius-lectures.jpg](https://p64.f2.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/geuwx7nk/Image%202020-06-03%20at%2010.11.28%20AM.png?v=8eef00c00dab7955db661af2f16c8d76)

He says, at 49:00 in the episode: 

> There is people who did not make Navarro. That was their first school they thought about, the first thing they signed up for, to try to get into Navarro, and they wish they could be in your spot. And to see some people just not performing, like, that's your heart and your passion, because I have a passion for cheerleading. 
>
> If you're not performing that part, then what is the point in even going full-out with the rest of the team? 
>
> Because I gotta know that your blood, sweat and tears are going to be put on this mat with me. 
> 
> Because I should not be out performing this entire section of people. Period. 
> 
> No, I'm not sayin, you ain't gotta be like me, but I'm talking about I wanna see it. Some people look like they're going through the motions. _I wanna see it_. 

You might say "OK, Josh, what about all that stuff you've been saying about La'Darius being unable to defend himself against Monica? This isn't what someone who just got beat down would say about getting beat down! He has his heart and soul in this!"

He's being hypocritical and tone deaf in his judgements of his team. Earlier in the episode, we've seen him doing what he's now lecturing others to not do. This is more than hypocrisy, though. If it were just hypocrisy, it would hardly be worth mentioning. 

Here's why I don't see hypocrisy in the lecture he just delivered to the team.

Remember how I referenced _Exit, Voice, and Loyalty_? La'Darius got forced into **Loyalty**. Having lost to Monica, he needs to reduce the cognitive dissonance he's feeling about his relationship to the team and cheerleading. If he wanted to leave and couldn't, and had no power to drive change inside the team, he _could_ technically quit the team, but it's such a bad option that he needs to convince himself that he is _loyal_ to the team.

He needs to convince himself that "trying hard" is the only moral option. 

_This lecture_ is what it looks like to have your spirit broken so badly that _you cannot even see that it happened._ Your view of yourself is now in-line with what your oppressor would have you think.

----------------------------------------------

# That night, or at least in the evening sometime later

Gabi and Sherbs doing crunches and stuff:

> My body better look perfect for Daytona

Andy, coach under Monica:
> its definately hard, on the body, on the mental aspect of it. it's not about just doing it right, it's about doing it so many times until you can't do it wrong.
>
> It's all about conditioning. we do a lot of repititions to make sure that being on the floor and being tired and being in pain they will be able to handle it.

It's obvious that _I_ think Monica's coaching methods are suspect. Maybe you feel the same. _It would be irresponsible for Monica to do anything other than what she is doing right now_ unless someone else, implementing an alternative and more humane methodology, came along and started beating her, because what got her 20 wins in 20 years works. Don't refactor a program without good reason.

So, despite how much we-the-viewers might lament seeing the bodies of these kids broken for Monica, we must realize that _as long as she has so much more power than her top-performing kids, she will not make changes_. 

Keep that in mind as Sherbs is about to get badly injured.

Here's the setup:

![before the stunt](https://p64.f2.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/p9uPp208/Image%202020-06-03%20at%2010.11.58%20AM.png?v=71b59a8c3874a5de159001d713d3e450)

And here's the injury:

![the injury](https://josh.works/images/sherbs-injury.gif)
_note: the above is a gif. Visit [josh.works/cheer](https://josh.works/cheer) to view the live gif_

--------------------------------------------------------


Monica had them doing dangerous stunts without anyone who knows anything about dealing with injuries on hand. She has to call the physical trainer, and ask the trainer to come in. 

Then Monica decides Sherbs just needs to go to the hospital, and has her carried out to her car. 

This was negligent but expected behavior. 

Monica is insulated from meaningful feedback from her team, and her coaching style & entire sense of self depends upon winning the annual Daytona cheer competition, _which she has done almost every year for twenty years_. 

So, she trains them harder and harder. Monica cannot or does not recognize that there is a point of diminishing returns, and then a point of _negative_ returns, on additional training. 

More stunts, more complex stunts, more training, more exhaustion. It's what got them a lot of victories so far, but she knows she needs to keep her edge over the competition, which is rapidly catching up with her team. 

----------------------------------------------------

The team circles up, prays (I didn't see that one coming) and then one of the team members, Austin, referencing Sherbs, after she's been carried out, says:
> That may have been her last rep.

Proposing that she may be injured and never able to cheer again. (Plausible)

Continuing:
> It's upsetting, its hard, but you know, it's part of sports, its part of life, and you know, things happen. How you respond to them is what makes you a better person, a better athelete, it's what makes you succeed in life, OK?

It's sad, seeing how the team is immediately having to revise the story, re-tell it in a way that this injury is akin to a soldier being killed in the line of noble duty, instead of a child worked to the point of injury, as a result of many failing and/or exploitative systems. 

![austin-lectures.jpg](https://p64.f2.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/d5uWBXG7/Image%202020-06-03%20at%2010.12.29%20AM.png?v=29350daf59e0c33df65f98b0c2decf89)

Look at how quickly the story gets changed; no one is at fault, "things happen", lets carry on. _To suggest otherwise would quickly lead to uncomfortable implications._

"things don't happen", people and systems _cause_ things to happen. 

Many layers of exploitative systems caused this to happen. Sherbs might be fine. She might not. She might have other options, she might not. 

At the moment, it's worth pointing out that _you_ the viewer are heavily wrapped up in this story, _without any plans or means of doing anything about it_. 

Nothing in this cheer team does anything for the atheletes besides "metaskills". They're skilled at _being skilled_. So, if they can apply _being skilled_ to the right domains, they'll be quite successful. If not, they won't. 

And so concludes the first half of this essay.

-------------------------------------------

# The Second Half

Switching gears now. 

I've picked through various people's behavior's with a fine-toothed comb. I've analyzed and quoted things people have blurted out to cameras on the midst of challenging and tumultuous times while emotions are running high and deadlines loom.

You will hopefully think:

> It's not fair of you, Josh, to pick on anyone in this show. They're products of their environment. Easy for you to throw stones, sitting there, doing nothing. No skin in the game, just arm-chair quarter-backing.

That's correct. This second stage is where I pull out a mirror, and examine "us". There's a few groups that fall under the "us" umbrella:

1. The makers of this documentary
2. Netflix, who bought and distributed this documentary
3. The "media", like late-night talk shows, movie stars, and others
4. Subscribers/viewers of those talk shows
5. Netflix subscribers, like me and you
7. Instagram/social media users
8. Brands who use Jerry/others to promote themselves, like Abrocrombe & Fitch, Rebel athletics, etc.

# Meta-narrative time

So, this is a long essay about a TV show. I feel like seeing the oppression here isn't a stretch. But that's only half of what I wanted to point out. 

Especially today, June 1, 2020, we don't need to look far to find rampant oppression and injustice.

### Value from college is low. "getting a scholarship to college" shouldn't be worth risking physical health over.

Please go watch this SNL skit about these kid's injuries:

[![SNL skit](https://p64.f2.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/12uNxjpw/Image%202020-06-03%20at%2010.12.55%20AM.png?v=f2e75190ceec8378a845c55b5b13c70f)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FKnBWUitu0))

Comedy often works by combining elements of uncomfortable truth with something we can safely laugh at. 

It is a comedy skit about exploitation, but is so over-the-top we can laugh at it. (The cheerleader in the ceiling, the injuries, the exploitation by the coaches, etc.)

### "The Media" is profiting off the problem

How does the media react to Cheer? By missing the point of the story while doing exactly what we expect media organizations to do:

From Vulture’s Jen Chaney, in a review of Cheer [Welcome to TV’s Cheer-ocracy](https://www.vulture.com/2020/01/dare-me-cheer-review.html):

> While it depicts plenty of conflicts and disagreements between the cheerleaders at Navarro College in Corsicana, Texas, it’s an ultimately more uplifting show **that uses cheer as a prism through which to explore overcoming all kinds of obstacles.**

Newsweek, in [Who Is Monica Aldama? Netflix 'Cheer' Docuseries Reveals How Coach Led Navarro College Cheer Team to Multiple Victories](https://www.newsweek.com/cheer-netflix-documentary-monica-aldama-1481107)

> The docuseries also shines a light on what it takes for a coach to lead a team to victory at the strenuous competition year after year. For Aldama, who's served as head coach of Navarro College's cheer team for more than 20 years, **that not only means practicing every day and demanding a strong work ethic from every student on her team, but instilling in team members the courage and ambition to tackle anything life may throw at them, whether it's a new mount or a challenge in their personal lives.**

I'm not onboard with these rosey interpretation. 

Is this an uplifting show about kids overcoming obstacles, and leaves us with the warm fuzzies? Or is it a show about current & ongoing systemic exploitation and oppression?

Lets take Jerry Lewis as an example. He lost his mom to cancer while in high school, seems like he never really mourned her loss. Monica uses him as a tool throughout episode 3 (to beat La'Darious into submission), and his uplifting demeanor implies that there's very real damage beneath the surface. Jerry puts on a front of overwhelming enthusiasm _because he is so broken on the inside_. 

He needs counseling. He needs therapy. He also needs _the means to support himself_, because his social safety net is sparse. 

I argue throughout the essay that Jerry is being used by Monica. I'm about to argue that _Jerry is now being used by the media and brands_, and we, who see it as such, should be deeply uncomfortable with this.

You may recognize some of the people he's being scene here with, like:

Brad Pitt:

![jerry_brad_pitt.jpg](quiver-image-url/C4F08E540C385F414BE2A0F51C948683.jpg =1396x727)

Ellen Degeneres:

![jerry_and_ellen.jpg](quiver-image-url/3D559C1627C0752E2DEF3EFD6442A0BD.jpg =1321x699)

Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator of _Hamilton, the Musical_:

![jerry_lin_manuel_miranda.jpg](quiver-image-url/04C75DBA2808E5BCCAC3CCA2AF073A35.jpg =1050x633)

Billie Eilish:

![jerry_and_billie.jpg](quiver-image-url/6A864A7D1FF7B5222FDE44F03CAC7CBD.jpg =1260x670)


I wonder how much actual value he's earned, actual capacity he's been given, to make long-term improvements to his life. We're expected to "celebrate" his fame and success, except it's statistically likely that having a college degree will not improve his life, and this fame doesn't seem likely to improve his long-term prospects either.

-------------------------------------------------

Do you want to reduce systemic oppression? Start getting these kids connected with something that can help them help themselves. 

Getting good grades sometimes correlates with success, but doesn't cause it. Being famous sometimes correlates with success, but again, does not cause it. Grit and adaptivity correlates with success, and _can_ cause it. 

By this I mean:

> Jerry has now met dozens of multi-millionaires, and has been part of the system that makes many, many people very rich. (American News/Film media).
> 
> He's been on tv shows, done sponsored ads, and more. American Eagle, Vanity Fair, etc.
> 
> Once the attention wanes, which it inevitably will, what will he be left with? 
> 
> Will he have the means to make a sustainable, adequate income? or will this moment in the spotlight be the apex of his life, and everything after this Cheer show pale in comparison to the last year or his life?

----------------------------------------------


Anyone on Navarro's cheer team is plenty capable of doing the work at Turing. 

Turing grads have pretty successful outcomes. To whet your appetite for what's to come:

![loryn-makes-100k.jpg](quiver-image-url/A536379765EFB4DF031247622D527221.jpg =943x579)

Loryn posted the above in a Turing channel titled `#salaries`, where grads can share their salary/packages. Loryn is having I'd say slightly above-average success, in that she started making $100k after less than a year on the job, but overall, _this is not a surprising result_.

What would Jerry be able to do with a good job and $100k/yr? And as importantly, how might he influence others if he did this and was successful?

Go take a look at his Instagram: [jerry.h.arris/](https://www.instagram.com/jerry.h.arris/). 1.2 million followers.

I want to sent Jerry to Turing, on a full scholarship, self-funded by me, Kristi, and you three.

And if Jerry isn't interested, after we reach out and give him the option, then we'd keep working down the list:
La'Darius, TT, Sherbs, Gabi, or anyone else on the Navarro cheer team.

# My big ask:

Assuming you think that I've identified a problem, and my plan is worth implementing, would you help me, to the tune of about $4k over the next year. 

Kristi and I would put in at least $11k. 

Your share would work out to about $330/month. This gets us to $30k/yr.

If we're all agreed here, we'll figure out how to get in touch with Jerry, and tell him "some interested folks" could swing a scholarship to Turing. 

He'd need to figure out housing and food, but we'd cover the cost of the program, some spending money, and of course utilize all that we can from personal networks to help with other issues (like finding housing).

If he says no, then I'd contact La'Darius. Then TT. Then keep working down a list. Eventually someone will say yes, and we'll sponsor that person, all the way through. 

(more details below)


------------------------------------

# As the objections start jumping to mind

A skeptical reader:

> So, Josh, your grand plan for reducing injustice in the world is to send a _single person_ to Turing? Why does that make a dent?

You should certainly have a long list of objections jumping to mind right now... I'll address them later in the paper. But for a moment, suspend disbelief and see how this plan might play out.

Our society is [memetic](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/mimetic), right? (Thanks, Alexander Wales)

If that's the case, we should go _with the grain_ of society, for trying to drive change. Do something in such a way that people with influence do the thing that we want them to do, and then others will see that example and consider it for themselves. 

I cannot convince a thousand people to consider an institution like Turing instead of college.

But I can convince one person, or a few people. And _those_ people could make a much broader push for high-quality alternatives to college than myself. 

For example here's someone who's is _right now_ convincing a few thousand people that Turing might be great:

That's par for the course for her other posts. But check out the text accompanying the post, quoted in whole below. Emphasis mine:

> The start of a new chapter ...
> 
> Today is my first day of a **six month intensive software development program called the Turing School. Not only does it represent the next step in my education towards a career in software development, it also represents an investment in myself.🧠 An investment of time, money, and effort to launch me towards achieving my goals in life and in climbing!**
Will it be easy? No. And that’s part of the point, because the best things in life require hard work, and I’m more than ready to dedicate to this project!
> 
> Special mention to a climbing friend of mine who is also an alumn of the Turing school. Thank you for giving me the insight about this program. **I knew that a four year university was not my path in life, but as I entered my senior year I was left feeling like I had no options. Hearing about Turing from you gave me an indescribable sense of relief that I had a choice on where to take my life after High school**. As soon as I learned more about the endless positives of the program, this relief turned into resolute determination. Because I knew right then that it was the right choice, I knew that I could dedicate myself fully to a program of this duration and caliber, and I knew that the positives of completing such an education were worth any amount of sacrifice and hard work. So here I am, following up on that choice to pursue something challenging that will enable me to pursue my passions for the rest of my life, and that’s a pretty special feeling 😸😸😸
> 
> If you have any questions about the Turing School you can ask me below or go to Turing.io !!


That second paragraph is referencing _me_. Sienna and I had a conversation in passing, at Earth Treks, in November. She was lamenting embarking on a college journey, and I said:

> Don't go to college. Go to Turing instead.

and subsequently spent two or three minutes making this case. We swapped numbers for further questions if she had any.

Later that day, we had this text exchange, and then I promptly forgot about the conversation.

![sienna-hears-about-turing.jpg](quiver-image-url/40C4E81289D5CA8FCD8F7DCD4D00DAEC.jpg =948x646)

Next thing I heard from her, she had:
- Done way more research
- Attended an in-person event to learn more about Turing
- Applied 
- Gotten accepted
- Chosen a start date

That was all a few months ago, and as of today (Early June, 2020) she's almost 1/4th of the way through the program.

She will avoid crushing student debt, will end up with a highly-desired-and-financially-rewarded skill set, and at the age when most of her peers are graduating college, will have enough on-the-job programming experience to be pulling down a $130k/yr+ senior software developer salary.

_She has control of her own direction now_. She will soon have _power_ in society. 

And this is how ideas spread. 

I've overheard Sienna talking with _other_ professional rock climbers about Turing. 


They are peers, and considering their own college journey. 

It is reasonable to me that in the next few months, a few other high-profile rock climbers will attend Turing. 

And, inevitably, _as they talk about it on Instagram, so too will not-high-profile rock climbers  hear about and consider attending something like Turing._ 

Combining their two followings, you'd get to 140,000 followers, and if these climbers did something like Turing, and reflected positively upon it, you could start seeing a big shift in how higher education works in the USA, _which would be a good thing no matter how it worked out_. 

For example, Turing could be full to capacity _for a year_ with just 360 students. If there continued to be more demand, one could see other organizations similar to Turing cropping up in other cities. As long as the quality and the demand stayed high, the capacity would keep growing to meet it. 

Turing is $20k for a seven-month program). It's easily 10-50x the value-per-month of college. 


As all of these people take these steps, they also _gain access to power in society_. 

I want this same thing for Jerry, or at least one person on the Navarrow cheer team. 

If someone on that cheer team _sees_ that something like Turing works, they'll tell their teammates. They'll tell their family. They'll talk about it on Instagram. 


----------------------------------------------

> Josh, wow. You seem a little too excited about Turing. It's just a glorified trade school. How could such a small institution be so important?

I have strange ideas, right? 

I'm aiming to bring about better systems, by way of helping historically low-power groups gain access to power. Remember how Robert Moses rolled, and how it took _people with power_ to stop him? I'm just hoping to start distributing power to people who can put it to _really_ good use. 

Rember how I really don't like the government or coersion in general? I'm unwilling to touch or even advocate for a legislative/coercivse 'solution' to the outlined problems. 

A reasonable conclution from reading _The Power Broker_ might be

> People with power are in the best spot to shape the world to their liking, but generally people with power act selfishly with it instead of selflessly.

I have power in society.

There's no way around it. 

I, Josh Thompson, occupy a privaleged, lucrative, influential spot in society. 

But I don't have influence the way instagram influencers have. (and it's worth distinguishing power from influence. In my mind, most "influencers" are low-power. The people that _buy_ their influence have the power.)

I have a generally bleak view when it comes to imagining that people might act in an "altruistic" ways. 

Basically, I hardly believe _I_ am capable of true altruism, and if I have grand ideas of anyone else doing something that is contrary to human nature, I am disconnected from reality.

So, it's _reasonable_ that someone would attend Turing, because they desire that $75k/yr average starting salary.

It's _reasonable_ that Turing would do it's best to train its students, because if it doesn't, it goes out of business, and if it trains students well, it continues to be financially successful. 

It's _reasonable_ that someone might, upon hearing a plausible endorsement of Turing from a trusted person, have a similar experience as Sienna and immediately choose Turing instead of college. 

It's _reasonable_ that the conclusions of this essay are not just virtue signalling my altruism, as I am willing to put substantial percentages of my pre-tax income towards this project. 

Nassim Taleb, author of [Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13530973-antifragile) would call this:

> Having skin in the game



------------------------------------------

# Small groups of people, outsized impact

> Josh, you're one person. I still don't think one person can make much of a dent in the world.

I believe this sentiment to be true on average, but emphatically disagree, in specific situations, _and I think this is one of those situations_. 

There's a few threads I need to tie together about small groups of people having _huge_ impacts, but at a high level, here's some case studies. I'm listing them in brief, as I could go into detail about why each of these instances further reinforces idea, but... I could then spend another two months working on this essay, and I feel that timely action is growing in importance. 



### Alex Guzey and Matthew Walker

[Alex Guzey](https://twitter.com/alexeyguzey) is a random guy in Russia. Kind, friendly on the internet, and he wrote [Matthew Walker's "Why We Sleep" Is Riddled with Scientific and Factual Errors](https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/), which for being just a single person doing research, caused the author of the book to have to do a non-trivial media circuit to repair his reputation.

He's like twenty two, and _really annoyed_ a large media organization. _With a blog post_. Damn. 

### Order Without Design podcast

This is my favorite book: [Order without Design: How Markets Shape Cities](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39644188-order-without-design?from_search=true)

Someone's starting a podcast with them. This book is criminally under-appreciated, but if law-makers got their heads wrapped around the principles, _or the average person understood the principles_, the area under their jurisdiction would see _massive_ improvements in the state of housing pricies, environmental impact, and mass transit. 

And everyone would be better off if this happened, not just the rich people.

Anyway, Devon Zuegel started a podcast series with husband/wife pair that authored this book, called [Order Without Design Podcast](https://devonzuegel.com/post/owd-1-tea-time-in-yemen)

On [Twitter](https://twitter.com/devonzuegel/status/1257753570268426241?s=20), she asked how people felt about transcripts and quality:

> What is your opinion on podcast transcripts?
>
> 🇦I don't care at all if there's a transcript
> 🇧I like to have at least a rough, AI-transcribed transcript for later reference
> 🇨Important that the transcript does not have significant errors, i.e. please transcribe it by hand

Added:

> Context:
> I'm planning to definitely have at least @otter_ai-generated transcripts for the Order Without Design podcast > (https://twitter.com/devonzuegel/status/1255886636212039680)
> 
> The decision I'm trying to make is whether to spend $150+ per episode in order to get perfect, manual transcripts

There were about 27 replies to that tweet, with people saying things like:

> Transcripts are super helpful for accessibility. So, the fewer errors the better

And Devon was like "it'll cost me $900 to get high-quality translations, or dozens of my own hours"

So, DM'ed her and said "I'll cover the first two episodes worth of transcriptions ($300)", and will likely end up covering the rest, too. [here's the first transcript I paid for her to get human-transcribed](https://devonzuegel.com/post/owd-1-tea-time-in-yemen#transcript). 

Because I didn't like how 20+ people ventured an opinion about something, _and were not willing to do anything about it!_. 

This has the _intended benefit_ benefit of encouraing more podcasts, which gives this idea that I wish people thought about an _enormous_ boost. I cannot convince anyone to read this book, but Devon might convince some of her followers to do so. 

I've now helped improve the chances that Devon stays excited and motivated to do this project, thus accomplishing the same goal I might want to accomplish, but in a massively more effective way than I ever could. 


### Maxable

[Maxable](https://maxablespace.com/) is an organization in California that's helped thousands of homeowners build accessory dwelling units on their property. 

Their business is booming, they're getting wealthy, and their customers are _making money_ by _helping people in need of housing get it, and in a way that improves the neighborhoods where this is happening_. 

This is an unmitigated good thing. 

They're [all over the news](https://maxablespace.com/about-maxable/) and it's quite likely Maxable made a meaningful difference in the passage of California's [granny flat law](https://maxablespace.com/california-granny-flat-law/)

### The Power Broker

Wow. Hard to know where to start.

I've spoken a bit about the three newspaper men referenced on page 1021, Gleason, Cook, Haddad. How they caused the newspapers to go from _ignoring_ Robert Moses' effects on the city to _trying to beat the other newspapers to the juciest headlines about how horrible he was_

I've managed to get the entire text from the book copied down and readable on [https://josh.works/cheer](https://josh.works/cheer)



### Patio 11, almost no one has heard of him

It'll take me too long to give this _incredible_ story a good overview.

Instead, read this blog post he wrote, which talks about the impact he was able to have _for the better_ on Japan's public health response to Coronavirus:

[An update on a pre-registered result about the coronavirus](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2020/04/21/japan-coronavirus/)


### Dan Carlin's _A Resipe for Caesar_ 

His _Common Sense_ podcast is too good. We all discussed it two months ago, I've not been able to shake thinking about it almost daily.

[Common Sense Podcast: A Recipe for Caesar](https://pca.st/jbofv0fp)

If the last episode of _Common Sense_ shook me as much as I think it did, and I'm doing this as a result, _than Dan Carlin, Podcaster, has singlehandedly influenced dozens of hours of my time and thousands of dollars of spending._

If he did this for me, and we're having this conversation, it's possible many others are thinking something similar.

### Someone who Manipulated the media "for the lulz"

[Trust me, I'm Lying: Confessions of a Media Manipulator](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13542853-trust-me-i-m-lying)

Dan Carlin in _A Recipe for Caesar_ said something like "if only there were a way to get really rich doing _good_ journalism instead of bad journalism"

I could see someone applying what's considered to be a "nefarious" set of skills in a pro-social way. Would just take the right person, context, etc. But again, _one person_ could shape an industry. 


### [Conspiracy: Peter Thiel, Hulk Hogan, Gawker, and the Anatomy of Intrigue](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36681909-conspiracy)

Peter Thiel, a rich person, spent a fairly large amount of money _to destroy a news organization with the legal system_, just because he didn't like it. 

Someone similarly moneyed might decide to bankroll using the legal system to hassle an existing structure that we might all wish didn't exist. 

So, this is evidence of "small groups, but lots of money".


-----------------------------


I believe that elements of the above stories can be combined in a way that show that what I'm advocating for has been done by others, repeatedly, in similar-but-different ways. 

# Skin in the game summary

- I've sponsored Devon's podcast human translations ($300), prompted by [this thread of people having no skin in the game while freely suggesting devon spend hundreds of dollars satisfying their whims](https://twitter.com/devonzuegel/status/1257753570268426241?s=20)
- $100 to Dan Carlin's podcast for this last episode.
- $300 USD in BTC to @Guzey (he's in Russia, so I couldn't easily send USD), so he can keep accessing critical information, prompted by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/alexeyguzey/status/1259146638825791489). 
- Arique, current Turing student, she's already changed the world, _and now she's about to gain access to power_. 
- Akira, suffering from mental health issues, was at times almost homeless, and _is now a software developer who has power_. (Because Turing). 
- I've spent _a lot_ of time helping Turing students be successful, and I am _good at it_. Good enough at it that I can confidently say I ensure that all these people we want to sponsor will be successful too.



# Reasonable objections

I don't know what objections have popped to your mind as you've read through this. I can imagine some responses, so I've outlined all I can think of below, and responded. 

Please make note of objections you have that I _don't_ address, and pass them my way. I'll update this document accordingly. _even more importantly_, please note where I claim to address an objection, but you don't feel compelled by my response. I'd be honored to be given the opportunity to discuss this in more depth with you, figure out if there's a middle ground that we both agree with. 

### I don't think Turing delivers what it says it delivers

There's a group called [The Council on Integrity in Results Reporting](https://cirr.org/) that audits/reports on all software development "bootcamps" who agree to participate. 

It's basically the [Underwriter's Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UL_(safety_organization)) of the "alternative software education" industry. 

Underwriter's Laboratory is a massively important organization in the world. Their stated mission, and the way they make _a lot of money while also protecting "powerless" consumers_:

Their mission is

> Empowering Trust

And they do it in a way where _if they do their job well_, they get rich, and their customers make money. (See? I'm angling to work with human nature here.)

There's a group called [Council on Integrity in Results Reporting](https://cirr.org/). Their mission is:
> Students spend precious time and money on their education. Don't they deserve to know before applying if a school produces the results they seek?

They're basically the Underwriter's Laboratory of the educational space. 

So, you can look at their reports on outcomes, per-institution, here: [https://cirr.org/data](https://cirr.org/data). Here's the [report from Turing for Q1&2 2019 (pdf)](https://static.spacecrafted.com/b13328575ece40d8853472b9e0cf2047/r/a1baa7a3d36d4f56a6c77c1e2a5df09c/1/Turing%20School%20Denver%20Back%20End%20Engineering%20H1%202019.pdf).

This is a _way_ better reporting model than any college has available to it. 

### OK, so there's a certifying body that plausibly backs up Turing's claims. Besides you, who else likes Turing?

I'd direct your attention to [Course Report](https://www.coursereport.com/schools/turing#/reviews), which is _another_ institution in the space of "building trust and validating claims". 

[Nick](https://www.coursereport.com/schools/turing?shared_review=24936#reviews):

> In my 'past life' as a middle school teacher, I was looking for an organization that would accelerate my career in front end engineering while putting their people first. This includes students, instructors, staff, and everyone involved. Turing is a place to truly be yourself while you learn. Turing is also place where you will lean into discomfort and talk about the ethics of AI and what your code could REALLY impact. Once I attended a Try Turing I didn't even look at any other coding schools. I knew this was the one.

Vanessa, "Beyond worth it!" [link](https://www.coursereport.com/schools/turing?shared_review=23948#reviews)

> Of all the bootcamp style programs, this is by far the most in depth and beneficial. After seeing friends go through the program and after a few years they were still employed and happy, I knew I was going to get the support I needed as someone who was completely new to tech. The curriculum is insanely fast paced, but ingrains a tenacious work ethic, and leaves you with the confidence and abilities to teach yourself anything new. Most bootcamp style programs don't teach their students anywhere near as much of the content that Turing provided me with. The community is so supportive, and the rapid growth of the program is proving to thoroughly benefit their graduates. Everyone I have met in the Turing alumni network has said attending Turing was the best decision they have ever made. Turing provides their students with the materials and resources they need to succeed, and I have no doubts in my worth as a junior coming into the field.


Lots of first-hand reviews of the program. The general tone is "highly enthusiastic", and even allowing for selection bias, _this is still a ringing endorsement for Turing_. 



### Someone else should do this. There's a lot of groups dedicated to improving the plight of people like Jerry

Lets take a look at the groups that have access to Jerry & the Novarrow Cheer team, and the means to improve his well-being. _Note how they benefit from the status quo_:


- Monica (preyed upon by Cheer Industry, which is fed by people living in America)
- Navarro College (which is part of the higher education industry, which preys upon and is fed by people living in America)
- Netflix (which represents a large portion of the growth in the Fortune 500, and feeds upon/benefits from the 70mm subscribers it has in the USA)
- Instagram (and the brands who buy ads/sponsorship on Instagram)
- Traditional media organizations (Ellen, Jimmy Fallon, late-night talk shows, Buzzfeed, the Oscars, etc)
- Large brands (American Eagle)

All of these groups make money off of people like the kids on this cheer team. Many of these groups are already wealthy, and _are made wealthier_ by this Cheer docu-series. 

I don't expect any of them to willingly improve the situation in a systemic way, _just as I don't expect Monica to update her coaching practices as a result of having possible lapses in her coaching commented upon_. 

How do I fit into this? I, Josh Thompson, subscribe to netflix. I have an instagram account. I watched a bunch of interviews online between public personas and the Navarro cheer team, I watched the SNL skit. I have contributed small amounts of money (directly, for Netflix, indirectly, for impression-based ad sales) to the organizations and systems that are at root of this oppression. 

### This problem is too big

So it'll need a sustained, long-term effort? Perhaps one lasting for years? and costing money and taking time?

I plan on seeing these people through Turing, and I'll help them grow in their careers after Turing finishes.

### This problem and your solution isn't relatable enough

I'd like to get to know the folks we end up sponsoring. I would plan on letting them know that "there's me and a small group of other individuals" interested in seeing them be successful at Turing, and otherwise making them reflect on our role as little as possible. 

I'd provide plenty of student support to them as they go through the program, and I'm confident that they'll be successful.

### I have a better idea

You've got an idea that is something a small group of people can attack, and higher-impact than this? Please, share! I'm _not_ convinced that this is a good long-term plan. I simply hope it is an improvement over our current situation, and _leads_ to a better/more effective plan. 

### I don't want to be involved because the time/energy commitment is too great

I know _I_ sound like a crazy person. How about you simply contribute the money, and I'll do all the implementation (including the tutoring/career counseling), representing your interests all the while.

You'll put in no other effort. I'll be able to say I'm backed by a "group of like-minded individuals", which gives my words extra weight. 

If I'm not able to do exactly what I'm proposing, I won't spend a penny, and you get all your money back.

### Why are you asking for money instead of spending _your_ money on high-impact projects

I've been spending our money on the highest-impact projects I can find. That's what's led me to this proposal. 

Kristi and me are give away 10-15% of our income, and I've been redirecting non-trivial portions of that into projects like this.

But Kristi and I don't feel quite quite capable of solo-sponsor a Turing student. We _almost_ can, but I'm not into thin margins, when so much of someone else's life is on the line. 

If Kristi and I put double the fraction in as anyone else, we'll bear more of the cost (obviously) and have more skin in the game, which should help alleviate _your_ concerns of if we're being ethical or not.

Even if currently you don't think we'd try to do anything funny, I'd rather have everything up front anyway. So, that means I'd be fully transparent in every way I can find about money allocations, time spent, etc. 

Lets say it costs $30k to fully outfit someone for Turing, and give margin before/after Turing:

Equally divided among all involved parties:

- William Hinrichs
- Justin Seymore
- Jason Kunsa
- Josh Thompson
- Kristi Thompson

$30k/5 people => $6k/person

Since this is all my idea, I'd rather Kristi and I contribute a larger-than-equal fraction. 

Kristi and I would plan on kicked in $18k, that would leave $4k per person, for the rest of you. 

This would be over about a year, so $4k/yr => $335/month. Would you be willing to contribute that much for about a year?

If you're saying "I could be convinced, but I need more information and need to make sure all this spending is transpoarent", I'd say 
> Great! I'd like to make sure everything is transparent to all parties as well, lets both do research to find something that works.


### What are the matrix of options available to me?

What natural and non-stilted language you use, dear reader:


![involvement-and-support.jpg](quiver-image-url/7850A9C494AA41071DF43652F670A03E.jpg =739x662)

Here's how I envision this. If you're intrigued, but not convinced yet, that's totally fine. I expect this to be a bit of a conversation before we get anything moving. 


### What if we contributed more than required? 

Unlikely to me that we over-shoot by much. We'd pay in total increments of $3-5k increments, so if we collected, say, and extra $5k 

1. You get the excess money back, in the same proportion that you contributed
2. We figure out if there's a good way to spend that cash. Gift to the student? Start funding someone else? 

You can do option 1 while everyone else does option 2, as well. So, other than the initial "get a single student through Turing", this won't be an ongoing expense. Once that student is done, we wrap this up and talk about how it went. 


### What if we contributed less than required?

This is why I want this number of people. It's important to me that the amounts we're contributing be well within our comfort zone, so that if we come up short, we can easily cover the difference. 

Kristi and I could throw an extra $1k/month at this, but would rather keep that option "in reserve". 


### Why is _now_ a time that's special?

When systems change, it's rarely the event of one particularly determined person. It's _mostly_ a change of circumstances/power in the world, and then the "change" is available to be had by whoever starts working on it first.

It _feels_ like now is different enough from 10 years ago and more that unusual methods might accomplish outsized results. 

Which means, as well, that institutions and people who were good at this _ten years ago_ might not be good at this _in the ways that are now most effective_. 

### Why you (Josh) and us (the readers)

Because I don't know that anyone else is taking advantage of this opportunity, _or if there's anyone else that can do it in this way_. 

I know for a fact that there's no one else that sees Turing in quite the same way I do. And Turing is the best-in-industry at what it does. 


### What if we're right, and successful?

What a good problem to have. I don't know. What do you think might happen?


### What if we're wrong and unsuccessful?

I _think_ that the worst outcome is we're all out the money that we've spent. 

As long as everything was done in a trustworthy and ethical way, I think we'd all feel a sense of shared satisfaction for even trying. 

We _might_ stumble across a better idea along the way, too, even if this idea doesn't work out.




# Conclusion

I could go on and on, answering nested sub-objections I've imagined.

But a week ago, a police officer murdered George Floyd. 

I started this essay two months ago. I'd rather move sooner. Turing takes seven months. 

By this time next year we could be chatting about how cool it is that Jerry or TT or La'Darius just got their first software development job. 

So, wrestle with what I've proposed!

IF you're game, we'll figure out all the pieces of this together. I think we could make things move quite quickly if we were so inclined.

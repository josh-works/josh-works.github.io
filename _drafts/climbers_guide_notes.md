# Lead Belaying in the Ground Fall Zone (A guide)

When your climber is beginning their climb, they’re in “decking range”, or “the ground-fall zone”. Until they are clipped to a bolt high enough above the ground that they cannot hit the ground if they fall, they are in “decking range”. In the next few minutes, we’ll discuss how to give a good lead belay to your climber when in the ground fall zone.

Most of this article will discuss climbing in the ground fall zone when climbing indoors, for several reasons:

    When climbing inside, the first bolts are often quite close to the ground. Outdoors, first bolts are often high enough that once you’re clipped, you’re out of the ground fall zone. (This means you will either need a stick clip, or you’ll be climbing dangerously high unroped to get to it…)
    When climbing indoors, there are situations where it’s OK for the climber to fall and end up standing on the ground. Outside, this is pretty much never the case, so you as the climber/belayer have more flexibility and room to practice what it’s like to catch falls low to the ground indoors.
    Most of us climb most often inside. By speaking just to indoor lead climbers, this guide can apply quite broadly without constant caveats to address how a climber/belayer might address the same situation outdoors.

Disclaimer: All that follows is in the context of INDOOR SPORT CLIMBING. When outside evaluate the landing zone, decide how risky it is to let your climber come anywhere close to the ground. My rule of thumb: if I think I might fall, I’ll stick clip as far as I can up the wall. 

First, where is the “ground fall zone”?

Inside, a good rule of thumb is “before the first bolt”.

In the picture below, the climber has for some reason skipped the first bolt. With such a high first bolt, he should not have skipped clipping the first bolt. The climber outweighs the belayer significantly, so we’ll say he was in the ground fall zone until he clipped the 3rd bolt.
Here the third bolt on the wall marks the end of the ground fall zone. The climber has inappropriately skipped the first bolt, and the belayer has WAY too much slack out. Don’t do these things. (source)

In this second picture, the first bolt is much lower to the ground than in the first picture, but because each bolt is so close together, the climber is still out of the ground fall zone when he or she clips the third bolt.

Rules for belaying in the ground fall zone

These rules are the same as in the guide to giving soft catches:

    Stand in the right spot
    Have the right amount of slack out
    React correctly to the fall

Lets unpack each of these:

# Why your Belayer is Keeping you from Climbing Hard(er)

Since climbing regularly again, I had a chance to observe lots of belaying in the gym.

I can’t walk up to a stranger and say “Excuse me, sir, I noticed that your poor belaying is totally crippling your climber’s ability to try hard, and actively eliminating any hope either of you have of improvement in this sport.”

It makes me feel for the climbers, though, because it’s difficult to improve at climbing with a bad belayer.

There’s a number of issues surrounding poor belaying, but they all tie back to either trust or competence.

The two can operate independent of each other:

    you can not trust a competent belayer (why don’t you trust them?)
    you can trust an incompetent belayer (whoops)
    you can not trust an incompetent belayer (good idea)
    you can trust a competent belayer. (Nirvana!)

While you can easily spot signs of an incompetent belayer, it’s much harder to determine if they are competent. Then, even if you’ve established their competence, it takes time to build trust in them.

Here’s why bad belaying keeps you from improving – even if you don’t actively consider the skill of your belayer (in other words, you’re trusting an incompetant belayer), your subconscious knows if they are competent and trustworthy. And if you’ve not actively considered their skill, you probably don’t trust them.

So, how do you know level of the trust/competence graph you’re on?

Here are some indicators of unskilled (and untrustworthy) belaying:

    Lets the rope hang between the climber’s legs when climber is lower than the third bolt.
    Short ropes climber and doesn’t know it.
    Spikes the climber and doesn’t know it.
    Keeps rope too tight or too loose.

Now – all of these are easily fixed. So – this is where trust comes in. If your belayer is making these mistakes, and is either unaware or unwilling to fix them, why would you trust them? None of these mistakes puts the climber in grave danger, but all can make climbing much less fun.

Take a look at this workflow to diagnose your competance and trust questions about your belayer:
Is your belayer competent? Do you trust them? SHOULD you trust them?
Is your belayer competent? Do you trust them? SHOULD you trust them? (Click for full-size)

If your belayer is competent, and makes none of the above errors, that’s enough to make you think they’re not only competent, but trustworthy as well.

Without trusting your belayer, you cannot push yourself hard enough to improve at climbing.

    How to Climb your First 5.10 (or 5.11)
    
(I think this is the whole post)

# How to climb your first 5.10 (and then 5.11!)

You’ll learn how to climb your first 5.10a (or V2, or V4, or 5.11a, or 5.12a) in this post, and more importantly, I’ll give you a framework for reliable, continuous, and measured improvement. This framework will serve you for the rest of your climbing career.

Someone on Quora recently asked “How can I climb my first 5.10a?”

Some variation of this question goes by on /r/climbing all the time.

This question is a good question for a two reasons:

    You’re already improving. If you want to improve, you probably are improving, or even if you feel like you’re not, you’re close to making more improvement, with the right approaches. For this, I salute you!
    Improve at improving: Learning how to climb the next grade (V2, 5.10, V5, 5.11, etc) will teach you how to learn to climb even harder. This current climbing barrier will be a mini-experiment for “how do you systematically improve at climbing”, and as you improve, you’ll also improve at improving. (Crazy, right?)

1.You’re already improving

How long have you been climbing? A few weeks, maybe a few months?

Do you maybe feel a little stuck right now, or you feel impatient to improve faster? (“Come on, muscles, skin, and tendons! Heal yourselves in 8 hrs of sleep every day!”)

You’re improving at rock climbing every time you go to the gym. You may not see the improvement, but this is because you’re not looking hard enough.

This isn’t feel-good nonsense, either. I’ll never say “you’re a special snowflake and can do anything and we’re all winners!”. That’s a lie. What’s true is that you’re learning a lot when you’re first starting to climb, you just don’t see it very well.

(If you’ve been climbing for a few years and feel like you’ve stagnated, you probably have stagnated, and are not improving. The framework I outline below will be useful to you, too.)

In the beginning… of your climbing career

Think back to the first time you tried climbing. Do you recall how strange the different holds felt? You probably grabbed a jug, and thought “this makes sense” and then felt a crimp, a pinch, or especially a sloper and thought “wtf?”

Now, a few months/years later, looking at a climb from the ground, you can imagine how you might use different holds. You don’t have to re-learn how to hold onto an undercling every time you touch an undercling.

Every time you get on the wall, you’re improving, thanks to building new schema. A schema is:

    an organized pattern of thought or behavior that organizes categories of information and the relationships among them.

Every time you rock climb, you are building your own “mental library” of hold types, movement patterns, etc.

Imagine you asked someone for advice on some specific boulder problem you were working on, and they said “shift your hips over the right foot, lock off your left hand, and throw with your right hand for the pinch.”

If they’d never done any of those individual components, this would feel rather difficult. But, right now, every time you go climbing, you’re teaching yourself these complex movement patterns that you will start being able to combine into more complex “chunks”.

Here’s a good example. This is an excellent depiction of what it looks like to build a mental library of movement patterns:

Video embedded in this Quora answer about how to climb 5.10a by Jane Kim. Well worth a read.

Look for the increasing complexity of her movement over time. This increased complexity is because she’s building “chunks” of movement that she can use when the situation calls for it, without having to think hard about the movement.

I promise that from 0:51-1:01 she’s not thinking “high right foot, pivot hips to right, use momentum to move my low foot up, twist lock into my low hand and extend my left to the jug, and now quickly open my hips to the left, move my right hand, step through with my left foot, use a left hand intermediate to adjust my balance to move my foot up again, and go again with the left to a good hold.”

She’s just rock climbing. [Read more…] about How to climb your first 5.10 (and then 5.11!)

# The Complete Guide to Soft Catches (as told in Gifs)

I have a confession.

A few days ago, I was climbing with a friend. He fell, and I gave him a terrible catch.

He didn’t get injured, but he was hurting, cradling his ankle, and trying to convince me I wasn’t the worst person in the world for claiming to be a good belayer and then SPIKING HIM INTO THE WALL!!! He kept climbing with me, but if I were him, I’d be suspicious of me. 🙁

I want to save you from repeating my mistakes, especially because the first step to climbing harder on lead is being able to give a good belay.

Before you go farther, note what someone said about what you’re about to read:

    [I sent this article] to my belayer and we made some adjustments. We would normally only give soft catches on bigger falls, but we started doing it even for smaller ones.

    Made a huge difference and increased my confidence 10x.

And with those results in mind, here’s what we’ll cover:

    What a soft catch looks like
    A comparison of a soft and hard catch
    How to give a soft catch

Quick note from Josh:

A soft catch is ideal in many situations, but if the climber is close to the ground or might hit a ledge, you would probably want to not give them a soft catch.

Ideally, you and the climber will discuss your game plan as the situation requires. I’ve often said “hey, keep me tight as I move off this ledge”, or “that move past the first bolt is difficult. Keep me tight there.” It’s best to know what a soft catch is and how to give it, and then, equipped with this knowledge, decide how to belay as you go. Thanks to the folks at /r/climbing for the suggestions. Head over there for some more discussion.
What does a soft catch look like?

If you’re new to lead belaying while sport climbing, a soft catch might look a bit counterintuitive. For top-rope falls, you just have to make sure you keep the rope in the brake position. Everything else pretty much takes care of itself.

Giving a soft catch

Lead falls are a different story. You should plan on not just getting pulled into the air but on jumping into the air. The falling climber’s weight will help give you a lift, but in most situations, you need to initiate the movement.

There’s a few things happening in the above catch:

    My hand drops to the brake position. I was feeding out slack as the climber fell, so I wasn’t already in the brake position.
    I quickly crouch and then hop. I drop my hips just a few inches, then hop up the wall.
    I briefly glance at my “landing zone” to make sure my feet are correctly positioned to catch me as I am pulled into the wall.
    I was pulled about five feet into the air. Look at where my feet ended up, compared to before the fall. This is a significant distance.

And that’s it! The good news is the climber does most of the work (by falling) and you just have to try to get the timing right.

Next, on to what not to do.
Comparing a good and bad catch
Same climber, same fall, same belayer. On the left is a soft catch, on the right, the climber is getting spiked.
Same climber, same fall, same belayer. On the left is a soft catch, on the right, the climber is getting spiked. Thanks Earth Treks Golden, and Alison S and Cristina P for the help!

Which of the two above look more comfortable?

If you look carefully at the bad catch, on the right, Cristina (belaying) starts to cover her mouth in the horror of what she just did.

I asked Cristina to spike Alison, the climber, and Alison gave her permission, but Cristina still hated doing it, even though it’s for a good cause.

YOU! THE READER! YOU’RE THE  GOOD CAUSE! DON’T LET ALLISON AND CRISTINA’S HORROR GO TO WASTE! [Read more…] about The Complete Guide to Soft Catches (as told in Gifs)


# The Lawnmower Method of Rope Management

<wistia video embed>

For all the lead climbers out there, there’s something you all do an awful lot of every time you lead climb and lead belay.

You feed out a lot of slack and you take in a lot of slack.

Right now we’re going to walk through how to take in a lot of slack quickly and safely.

I once got to happen upon the aftermath of an accident in a climbing gym. A woman was trying to take in slack, but was out of the brake position when her partner fell.

She was using an ATC. He outweighed her significantly, and she dropped him from about 40 feet. He was fine, but she badly burnt her hands.

The concern, when you’re taking in a large amount of slack is that your climber could fall at any moment. This could happen right after they say take, or if they try to clip and drop the rope. You want to quickly take out a lot of slack.

The Lawnmower Method of slack management

The Lawnmower Method is a quick and easy way to take in big handfuls of slack in a rush. The best part is, you’re in the brake position almost the whole time, so this method is in accordance with tube-style belay best practices. [Read more…] about The Lawnmower Method of Rope Management

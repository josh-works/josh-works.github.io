Hi there, Golden. ðŸ‘‹

I'm running for the Ward 2 seat for City Council.

You probably shouldn't vote for me, and here's why:
- I'm running for city council because I'm curious about the process. I'm not doing it out of selflessness, or a sense of community service. I'm a bit leery that someone who *loves* politics will get the seat, and that causes me discomfort.
- My base political beliefs are firmly established and resistant to change. I unequivocally dislike the exercise of political authority, and think it harms everything it touches. It's most damaging at the federal level, but even local politics is not immune to these negative effects. (I recognize that this is an extreme political stance)
- I usually dislike meetings and many people. I generally just want to be left alone and in peace, but the political process is biased towards letting other people tell me how to live my life. So, I'm trying to preempt that influence, and maybe steer it away from me.


If you've not yet written me off as a lunatic, here's some reasons you *should* vote for me:
- **The ideas advocated on www.strongtowns.org appeal to you** The StrongTowns community is what motivated me to try to run for city council. If you're curious for how I'll approach an issue, I am almost always in complete agreement with StrongTowns. If you like them, you'll like me. If you can't stand them, you might not like my position on some topics. 
- **You're comfortable with someone who has "extreme" political beliefs on the city council.** I don't find the moral basis for the state's political authority compelling, nor can you reason your way into our current form (or any form) of government from first principles.
- **You have low expectations of the political class** I don't believe any single person, no matter how well intentioned, can do much before the Kafkaesque nature of the state. I don't expect to be able to do much, and I make no promises about anything.

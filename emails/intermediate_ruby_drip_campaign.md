subject: "Burning Pains"

What is a burning pain you're feeling at work, at least partially related to software development?

And why?

PS Could you provide some context to your response? 

I was really confused on the email, I have 100 questions.

Why: 
- are your listed subjects being considered?
- are you breaking up your email?
- is typing so slow important?
- couldnâ€™t you figure out how to write a short letter?
- the Mark Twain quote? What does that mean?
- are you apologizing?

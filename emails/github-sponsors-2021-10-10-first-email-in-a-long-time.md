title: Episode 6: Subversion(?)
---

It has been a very, very long time since I've sent an update to this list. May 13, then trickling back from there.

I think most of you are subscribers on my other list (https://josh.works/) and _some_, maybe most of you, subscribe to https://www.intermediateruby.com/. 

I feel particularly burdened by this silence, because you all are, by definition, paying me monthly! 

But none of you are paying me _that much_, so it's not a big deal. Most of you spend more on Netflix than on this list, and I guarantee that the rate of "i am modestly entertained" units-per-hour is higher on the few minutes you spend on this email than the same number of minutes of some of the last month of streaming services you've consumed.

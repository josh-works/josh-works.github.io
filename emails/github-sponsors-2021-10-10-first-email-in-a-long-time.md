It has been a very, very long time since I've sent an update to this list. May 13, then trickling back from there.

I think most of you are subscribers on my other list (https://josh.works/) and _some_, maybe most of you, subscribe to https://www.intermediateruby.com/. 

So, those of you who are on the other lists have gotten a few emails from me. 

This list, though - this list is where the fun stuff is going to be recorded.

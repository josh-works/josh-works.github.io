I figured it out. 

I figured out what I'm trying to do. 

Take a look at these two pictures:

![subsidized and ugly - fully crop](/images_2020/subsidized-cropped.jpg)

![illegal but beautiful](/images_2020/illegal.jpg)

Compare their "stats"

One of the buildings:
- 6 floors
- 165 bedrooms
- 28,000 sqft retail
- 100% land coverage
- 0 gardens
- 0 porches
- 440 parking spaces

The other one:
- 2-4 floors
- 185 bedrooms
- 28,000 sqft retail
- 62% land coverage
- 13 gardens
- 68 porches
- 145 parking spaces



In a table:

| Beautiful | Not so beautiful     | 
| :------------- | :------------- |
| 6 floors       | 2-5 floors       |
| 185 bedrooms       | 165 bedrooms       |
| 28,000 sq ft retail       | 28,000 sq ft retail       |
| 62% land coverage percentage | 100% land coverage percentage |
| 13 gardens | 0 gardens |
| 68 porches | 0 porches |
| 145 parking spaces | 440 parking spaces |

Right now, the big ugly building is more likely to be built. It's *subsidized*. 

The nice stuff? It's illegal.

So I want to do two things:
1. Make the nice stuff legal
2. Stop subsidizing the bad stuff

I'll re-phrase:

I want to make this _legal_:

And I want to stop subsidizing this:

Here's how Wikipedia defines [subsidy]():

>A **subsidy** or **government incentive** is a form of financial aid or support extended to an economic sector (business, or individual) generally with the aim of promoting economics and social policy. 

Most people I've asked, when I've asked which of those two pictures looks better, have *all* immediately agreed that the "human sized" layout looked far nicer.

There's a few fixes that need to happen. Along the way, we might end up accidentally fixing a bunch of other stuff too. 

Happy little accidents. 

Next time - lets talk about how the bad stuff is subsidized!

---------------------

---------------------

Picture of Donald Shoup's _The High Cost of Free Parking_. 

Here's a 700 page book about _parking legislation_. It's probably boring to most people, but it's absolutely riveting to me. 

The book is simple. It argues that:

<summarize shoup>

(which argues that parking minimums _alone_ discourage good stuff, encourage bad)

Pictures of three parking garages, picture of "parking free during so-and-so", math out how it's likely no one pays for parking. 

Show the empy paid lots nearby. 

Donald Shoup has a great quote. He says:

<quote about why everyone should be onboard with getting rid of free parking>

There's other things we could say, but I'm comfortable leaving this here. 
------------------------

------------------

Last time, I talked about ending parking miimums. I think that's an easy case to make. My last email wouldn't have necessarily convinced _everyone_, but I think if I sat down over a beer with someone someone who thinks parking minimums do more good than harm, we'd probably end up in broad agreement, and still friends, _and I bet that person would be onboard with my desire to implement Shoup's recommendations_. 

There's a few other things besides parking minimums that prohibit the good stuff from getting built:

- setback requirements
- minimum lot size requirements
- prohibition of mixing commercial/residential activity

I'll talk about that next time. For now, remember - this is illegal in Golden:

-------------------------------------

We'll talk about three things:
1. setback requirements
1. minimum lot size requirements
1. prohibition of mixing commercial/residential activity

These things, combined, act to subsidize this:

And discourage this:

### Setback Requirements

A "setback" is a legal requirement that you not build too close to the property line. 

In zoning codes, they look like this:

On a piece of paper, setbacks do this:

Here's what they look like in neighborhoods:

This page is an onging project as I progress through Turing's [backend development curriculum](https://www.turing.io/programs/back-end-engineering)


Throughout my time at Turing, I try to teach what I learn, because _that helps me learn better_.

As I write stuff, I've usually saved it as a gist on Github. Those are not searchable, and it's hard sometimes even for me to remember what I've written.

What follows below is a curated list of useful material, ordered by either the module it might best apply to, or a more general category. These are intended to benefit current Turing students, and encompass much of what I've written during my time at Turing.

## General

*   [Deliberate Practice (Lightning Talk)](https://gist.github.com/josh-works/65802ebf3c90025b113b52cbf6a79c71)

*   [Example of how I ask a very knowledgable person for help (hint: make it easy for them to have the information, and respond in their time)](https://gist.github.com/josh-works/9a386cd033dec833b65257af6eaa4fbc)

## Before Turing

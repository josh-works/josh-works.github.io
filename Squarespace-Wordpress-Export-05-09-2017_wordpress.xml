In life, they call you "wise". </span></p><p><span style="font-size:medium">It's foolishness to pass up on the collective experience of the millions who have gone before you. Until you dive in, you don't know what you're missing. </span></p><p><span style="font-size:medium">What follows is not a comprehensive list of everything I've read, but some of what I've read at some point in the past is listed below. I don't have a reliable, low-friction way to track every book I read.&nbsp;</span></p><p> </p><h3>The List</h3><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Carrie-Stephen-King/dp/0307743667">Carrie</a>, Stephen King</p><p>Carrie is King's <em>first</em>&nbsp;book. I stumbled across it the book after seeing a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psrHRHEs8H8">creative movie trailer</a>. It's an excellent read.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1379035397&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=getting+things+done">Getting Things Done</a>, David Allen</p><p>Super-classic. I'm hoping for great insights. This is critical reading for anyone who has to do things every day. Which should be everyone breathing.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Federalist-Papers-Alexander-Hamilton/dp/1441413049/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373082675&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+federalist+papers"><em>The Federalist Papers</em></a></p><p>Does this even need explanation? I've never read them cover to cover, so I'm making up for lost time. 'Murica.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Christian-LIfe-Doctrinal-Introduction/dp/1848712596/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1379035429&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+christian+life+sinclair">The Christian Life</a>, Sinclair B Ferguson</p><p>Highly recommended by my pastor (who has read it over eight times) so it got placed at the top of my list.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mathemagics-Genius-Without-Really-Trying/dp/0737300086">Mathemagics,&nbsp;</a>Arthur Benjamin</p><p>"The secret art of mental math" is the selling point of this book. There have not been many real-world applications for these skills, but I sure wish I had picked it up in middle school. I hated doing all the work on paper, and I did not like solving from right to left. ("Lets see... I know the answer ends with a 3" is less helpful then "I know the answer starts with eleven thousand")</p><p>The real benefit has been from the short chapter on memorizing numbers. I won't get into the details here, but the author gives a very strong system for rapidly memorizing long numbers. I've used this to memorize street addresses, gate and flight numbers, and even a few critical phone numbers, all of which eliminate the need to constantly refer to the written word.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rework-Jason-Fried/dp/0307463745/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1379035323&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=rework">Rework</a>, Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson</p><p>37 Signals runs an honorable business providing useful service to interested customers. A tremendously talented company that points out a lot of problems afflicting individuals and corporations. This book can be read in a sitting, but you should allot at least a few hours to think about it as you read.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Strategic-Customer-Service-Managing-Experience/dp/0814413331/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1379035655&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=customer+support">Strategic Customer Support</a>, John Goodman</p><p>I do customer support, and there are a lot of things we could do better. Goodman makes a great case for seeing customer support not as a cost center but a revenue generator. Now if only I could get this book in the hands of more people...</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Freakonomics-Economist-Explores-Hidden-Everything/dp/0060731338/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1379035455&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=freakonomics">Freakanomics</a>, Stephen Levitt and Stephen Dubner</p><p>It's a classic, so I had to read it. I like that he doesn't follow traditional economic theories (besides being boring, they are usually wrong) but he's no Austrian, so he and I don't always see eye to eye. An entertaining read, none-the-less.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Gain-Disorder/dp/1400067820"><em>Antifragile,Â&nbsp;</em>Nassim Taleb</a></p><p>This is my second time through this book. If I could recommend only one book to just about anyone, this is it. The premise of the book is this: there is a whole class of things thatÂ&nbsp;<em>gain</em>&nbsp;from disorder and stress. It is foolishness for us (individually or as a society) to protect everything that we can from uncertainty, especially since some things are improved by uncertainty. When we do this, we set ourselves up for rare, but catastrophic events. This book ties well into De Soto's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Money-Bank-Credit-Economic-Cycles/dp/1610161890/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373082783&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Money%2C+Bank+Credit%2C+and+Economic+Cycles"><em>Money, Bank Credit, and Economic Cycles</em></a>. (Hint: Central banks exist to protect "regular" banks from theÂ&nbsp;inevitableÂ&nbsp;failure that must come because of fractional reserve banking. Central banks eventually pick up a liability so great evenÂ&nbsp;they cannot handle the burden. Example: America, circa 2013)</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Will-Teach-You-To-Rich/dp/0761147489"><em>I Will Teach You To Be Rich,&nbsp;</em>Ramit Sethi</a></p><p>A personal finance blog for young folks. I get a lot of value from Ramit's blog, and this book is no exception. He focuses on the un-sexy but crucial items that go into having solid personal finance: Get out of credit card debt, max out an employer's match for a 401K, automate good spending habits, have good credit, and don't feel guilty about spending within your means. If you use some of this material to save a little better for retirement, or a trip you are taking, this book has thousands of dollars of value. Read it.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Habits-Highly-Effective-People/dp/0743269519"><em>The Seven Habits of Highly Influential People</em>, Steven Covey</a></p><p>My reasons are easy. I want to be influential, and I like habits. It is almost embarrassing that I've not read this yet, because I've heard about it so much. My office has a bunch of good books sitting on a shelf, so I'm systematically working my way through 'em.</p><p><a href="http://mises.org/etexts/mises/bureaucracy.asp"><em>Bureaucracy</em>, Ludwig Von Mises</a></p><p><span style="font-size:medium">A neat little book by an influential thinker of the Austrian school of economics. If you agree with the Austrians, you'll probably love this book. If you don't, this isn't the best place to be introduced.</span></p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Golden-Ratio-Worlds-Astonishing-ebook/dp/B001L4Z6Q2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374532324&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+golden+ratio"><em>The Golden Ratio</em>, Mario Livio</a></p><p><em>Phi</em><span style="font-size:medium">&nbsp;is defined as the ratio between a line, and the same line broken into two segments where the first segment is to the second segment as the second segment is to the whole. And it's a whole book about it. There has been a long history of ancients trying to tie</span><em>the forms</em><span style="font-size:medium">&nbsp;to physical reality. In </span><em>The Golden Ratio</em><span style="font-size:medium">, Livio debunks most of those attempts, but then busts out an interesting chapter on fractals at the end. I skimmed the book (I'm not </span><em>that</em><span style="font-size:medium">&nbsp;nerdy) but unless you're really excited about obscure things, this is not recommended.</span></p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Retirement-Without-Winning-Lottery-ebook/dp/B008TW1BH2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374533383&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=saving+for+retirement"><em>Saving For Retirement,&nbsp;</em>Gail MarksJarvis</a></p><p>Retirement: if you're my age, this is probably not the most exciting thing you could talk about. That said, if you get started now, you can make good things happen with a lot less pain than you would otherwise. Get your ducks in a row, and dive in. Since we're supposed to rely upon the stock market to grow our money enough to retire, I recommend reading both <em>Money, Bank Credit, and Economic Cycles</em>&nbsp;and <em>Antifragile</em>. You might as well have a more nuanced perspective than "the stock market will absolutely grow on average of 10% a year because....Â&nbsp;<em>it always has</em>."</p><p>No matter how you decide to sock money away for later, a pretty basic requirement for entering adulthood is figuring out how to manage what you have responsibly. So read this book. It's a good intro.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Money-Bank-Credit-Economic-Cycles/dp/1610161890/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373082783&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Money%2C+Bank+Credit%2C+and+Economic+Cycles"><em>Money, Bank Credit, and Economic Cycles</em>, Jesus Huerta de Soto</a></p><p><span style="font-size:medium">If the title didn't scare you off, keep reading. It's massive (almost 1000 pages) but no other book or individual has so clarified my understanding how how money functions in an economy. If you think this does not matter to you, just remember a wise quote that applies to poker, and the rest of life: "Look around the table; if you can't see the sucker, you're it." Do you wonder why America's economy has alternated between boom and bust since the turn of the century? Ignore the damn Keynesians - they're wrong, and someday we'll call them on it. De Soto drops knowledge bombs the whole way through. I read only half the chapters, and about 1/3 of what I read was footnotes, so it's actually fairly quick reading. (If you don't read the footnotes.)</span></p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Stand-Stephen-King/dp/0307947300/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373082382&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+stand"><em>The Stand</em></a>, Steven King<em>&nbsp;</em></p><p><span style="font-size:medium">After reading </span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/0143118072"><em>Paradise In Hell</em></a><span style="font-size:medium">&nbsp;I was interested in seeing how post-disaster communities are depicted in popular literature. A little poking around Amazon landed me on </span><em>The Stand</em><span style="font-size:medium">. The reviews rave, and I've not read much fiction lately, so I've jumped in with both feet.</span></p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Joy-Less-Minimalist-Living-Guide/dp/0984087311/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373082542&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=minimalism+live+a+meaningful+life"><em>The Joy of Less,&nbsp;</em>Francine Jay</a></p><p><span style="font-size:medium">We've been on a de-cluttering spree lately, so I figured I might read up on it. The book is pretty repetitive, but since we're all human, repetition can be exceedingly helpful. It's a quick read, and if you are impacted by her writing and make even small changes, over the course of a year or two, it could mean big changes. Read it.</span></p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/0143118072"><em>A Paradise Built in Hell,&nbsp;</em>Rebecca Solnit</a></p><p><span style="font-size:medium">This is a book that for most people is purely academic, and for a few unfortunate souls (or perhaps fortunate?) could mean the difference between life and death. Since perception can equal reality, its worth your time figuring out what sort of society may arise in the wake of a disaster. Are you a Hobbesian "nasty, brutish, and short" sort of fellow? Guess what - you'll make it happen. Perhaps you're more Lockean, and you think that organized society arises from the mutual interests of all men? Guess what - you can make that happen too. Solnit warns against the dangers of "elite panic", which is when political elites panic about losing their power, and instruct the military to go out and prevent looting. Which almost never happens in a disaster anyway. ("Whoa. earthquake. No power. I'm totally going to score a 48" LCD now!" said no one, ever.) This is one of the top two books I'm currently recommending. Please, read it.</span></p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Never-Eat-Alone-Secrets-Relationship/dp/0385512058/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1371182170&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=never+eat+alone"><em>Never Eat Alone,&nbsp;</em>Kieth Ferazzi</a></p><p>It is worth repeating - relationships make the world go 'round. It behooves us all to spend more time out from behind a screen (ahem. As this is created and consumed from behind a screen) and more time in front of real people. This is not the end-all book on building relationships, but it's a quick read, and contains a lot of useful material. Even if you don't read it, pour more effort into relationships. It's effort that can never be wasted. Usually.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Think-Grow-Rich-Original-Unedited/dp/193764135X"><em>Think and Grow Rich</em>, Napoleon Hill</a></p><p>Hill writes a doozy. It was published in '37, and at times seems a bit hokey, but the core is this: If you want something really, really bad, you can make it happen. Just don't accept anything less than success. He spends a lot of time talking about how man can manipulate the ether with his thoughts, but if you exchange "ether" with "the power of mindsets, framing, and heuristics", the book holds water. It's been around for 70 years - that in and of itself is worth quite a lot.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Liars-Poker-Rising-Through-Wreckage/dp/0739357301"><em>Liar's Poker</em>, Michael Lewis</a></p><p>Who here loves Wall Street and trusts them to hold America's interests at heart? Hm. How about politicians? No one? I wonder why.Â&nbsp; Lewis writes about his experience with the hottest investment banking firm in its hey-day. If you thought it was boring, just imagine what <em>you</em>&nbsp;would do with a company credit card good for a few million. It's a good read.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Escape-From-Cubicle-Nation-Entrepreneur/dp/B003VYBEK2"><em>Escape from Cubical Nation</em>, Pamela Slim</a></p><p>Is there life outside the cubical? Yes. Start planning your departure now. Slim is inspirational, but IMO speaking to too wide an audience - the book applies to everyone, but is understandably light on specifics. If you've not yet been convinced that you should not spend your whole life working for someone else, this is worth your time. If you already know this, it's not worth reading.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Game-Thrones-Song-Fire-Book/dp/0553573403"><em>Game of Thrones</em></a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Game-Thrones-Song-Fire-Book/dp/0553573403">, George R.R. Martin</a></p><p>These are some long books, with insanely complex political relationships. I sort of gave up on the series half way through the fourth book. I wanted more dragons, more magic, and more Others.</p><p><a href="Season One Omnibus"><em>The Returners</em>, Mikey Neumann</a></p><p><em>The Returners</em>&nbsp;started out as a chapter-by-chapter fan-directed experiment, and concluded with the most amazing mix of historical and fictional characters ever assembled on the same planet. It's excellent, and very, very unconventional. (Want to know how Peter the Great and Joan of Ark would interact if they lived at the same time? Read this book.)</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Deep-State-Government-Secrecy-Industry/dp/1118146689"><em>Deep State: Inside the Government Secrecy Industry,</em>&nbsp;Ambinder and Grady</a></p><p>A casual examination of how all things "secret" work in the US government. The authors clearly side on the side of the government, and avoid some ethical issues I wish they had covered. Interesting, but not recommended.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Intellectuals-Society-Expanded-Thomas-Sowell/dp/0465025226/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373087043&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=intellectuals+and+society"><em>Intellectuals and Society</em>, Thomas Sowell</a></p><p>Thomas Sowell is the man; he's written a lot, and I've read most, so eventually his books sort of blend together.&nbsp;<em>Intellectuals and Society</em>&nbsp;instills a healthy dose of skepticism for the proclamations of experts and intellectuals. Since most experts think they are right, and that the world would be a better place if we followed their policy recommendations, you are doing yourself and your country a service by being wary of those experts and intellectuals.</p><p>The book does run into difficult spots when Sowell uncritically accepts his own positions, while attacking those who disagree with him, but since its his book, and he spends plenty of time elsewhere building a coherent worldview, this is not a big deal.</p><p>I love Thomas Sowell, and if you had a short list of authors everyone should read, he'd unarguably be on that list.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Americas-Great-Depression-Murray-Rothbard/dp/146793481X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373229337&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=America%27s+Great+Depression"><em>America's Great Depression,&nbsp;</em>Murray Rothbard</a></p><p>This is<em>Â&nbsp;</em><em>the</em>&nbsp;explanation for why the Great Depression happened. For all the concern modern politicians have for avoiding another great depression, you would wonder if anyone bothered mentioning <em>it's already been figured out</em>. This truth would be inconvenient, however, because in their fervor to avoid a great depression, they are taking steps that will virtually guarantee future depressions. It's cool to be Keynesian, though, if you're a politician. Arrogant power aggregation gets re-labeled "helping".</p><p><a href="Innovation and Entrepreneurship"><em>Innovation and Entrepreneurship,&nbsp;</em>Peter Drucker</a></p><p>Published in the mid-80s, he was talking about intentional innovation between "iterate", "pivot", and "intra-preneur" were common words. If you want to innovate, this is a good place to get started.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=Outside%20In%3A%20The%20Power%20of%20Putting%20Customers%20at%20the%20Center%20of%20Your%20Business"><em>Outside In: The Power of Putting Customers at the Center of Your Business,</em>&nbsp;Manning, Bodine, Bernhoff</a></p><p>This book is groundbreaking, and changed my life. It helped me tie a common thread through all the initiatives I've taken at any job I've had - I seek to help businesses better serve customers, and this book, published by <a href="http://www.forrester.com/home">Forrester Research</a>, makes a powerful business case for doing just that. They argue, persuasively, that customer satisfaction is ultimately what differentiates a very successful business and a bankrupt business.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Names-Don-Delillo/dp/0679722955"><em>The Names,&nbsp;</em>Don Dilillo</a></p><p>This is supposedly one of Dilillo's best works. Genre defining, meditative, thought-provoking, etc. I have no doubt it's all of these things, because a lot of people said so, but it wasn't for me. I just couldn't get into it, and stopped reading about half-way through. (Reading tip #1: Never finish a book you don't want to. There are too many good books, and not enough time, to justify reading books you don't want to read.)</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Will-Teach-You-Be-Rich/dp/0761147489/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373587053&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=i+will+teach+you+to+be+rich"><em>I Will Teach You To Be Rich,&nbsp;</em>Ramit Sethi</a></p><p>This book, more than most, could change your life. If you're finances are not in complete control, Sethi will help you get there. If your finances are controlling you,&nbsp;<em>read this book</em>. He's got an ego, but doesn't write BS. He will help you get to a better place, and being in a bad financial spot darkens your outlook on <em>everything else</em>. Don't be too unaware, passive, or scared to get started. Right now. Click the link, buy the book. If you feel guilty spending the $10 you'll need to buy it used and ship it, let me know. I'll cover half the cost. Seriously.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Catch-Me-If-You-Can/dp/0767905385/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373587230&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Catch+Me+If+You+Can"><em>Catch Me If You Can,&nbsp;</em>Frank Abagnale</a></p><p>Please read this book. It's the story of a <em>true fake</em>, popularized by the movie of the same title. Not only an interesting story, Abagnale's story lends credence to the idea that "confidence isÂ&nbsp;<em>almost</em>&nbsp;everything." I couldn't put the book down, and read it in about two days. It's a true story about one of the best (and youngest) scammers of the century. Oh, and he started when he was 16.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stiff-Curious-Lives-Human-Cadavers/dp/0393324826/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373587532&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Stiff%3A+The+Curious+Lives+of+Human+Cadavers"><em>Stiff,&nbsp;</em>Mary Roach</a></p><p>A story about the "curious lives of human cadavers". Since I never thought much about what happened with people when they died (not heaven vs. hell, but more "burial vs. cremation vs. lab vs. other options) I was pleased to stumble across this book. There's a bit of historical perspective (I pity the recently-beheaded persons who were forced to endure tapping on the head and loud noises to see if they still responded...) along with humor. If you want to pick up some trivia that will leave everyone wondering if you're a sociopath, this is a good start.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/All-Names-Jose-Saramago/dp/0156010593/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373587718&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=All+the+Names"><em>All the Names</em>, Jose Saramago</a></p><p>The first thing you'll notice in this book is the missing paragraph indentations, quotation marks, and a whole lot of run-on sentences. Saramago writes through the eyes of an almost-mindless bureaucrat who works in the National Registry.

Bastiat reflects on the role in society law plays, and discusses (with great wit) perversions of the law.

Oh, and remember - you get paid based on how much value you deliver to your business. If you suddenly start delivering more value, you're in a strong position to earn more.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[&nbsp;<p>If you got to this website because of something related to climbing, head to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.climbersguide.co/conquer-fear-course/">The Climber's Guide</a>. I don't write about climbing here.&nbsp;</p><hr />

      <img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/t/588a26199de4bb99f28fcac1/1485448771180/?format=original" alt=""/>


<p>When I die (or, rather, a little before I die, if I have time to be contemplative about my death) I plan on reflecting back on my life.</p><p>I expect that my peace with life will be based not on how much I've worked, or how much money I've made, but will be based on a mix of my relationships and experiences as informed by my theology.</p><h3> </h3><h3>Theology</h3><p>My theology is simple. I ascribe to the <a href="http://www.reformed.org/documents/WSC.html">Westminster Catechism</a> (full disclosure, I couldn't spell catechism if it were not for spellcheck) and believe that about 2000 years ago, a man named Jesus lived, said things of enormous significance, died, <em>and then rose again</em>.</p><p>You, too, have a theology. Statistically, it's probably "I don't care if there is/isn't a "god", but I wish people were not so terrible to each other."</p><p>This is <em>totally fine with me</em>. I'm not writing about theology, but in an effort to be "intellectually humble", I must outline my assumptions about the world, so you can evaluate them, weigh them, glean any possible value from them, then discard the rest.</p><p>Here's my stab at a <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3026791/dialed/personal-mission-statements-of-5-famous-ceos-and-why-you-should-write-one-too">personal mission statement</a>&nbsp;(though I'm only partially sold that I should have one):</p><p><em>Learn and apply as much as I can in all domains, embracing any failure as a learning opportunity, and humbly share my experiences with others to inspire them to do the same. I will expose myself to difficulty and risk in a wise fashion, knowing that this exposure is one of the best ways to learn.</em></p><h3> </h3><h3>Relationships I</h3><p>My relationships are simple. I'm married, and it's the coolest thing. I don't know how to best sum it up, but far and away the best thing I've got going for me is Kristi. This relationship far outweighs other things that I spend a lot of time writing about, like money, travel, work, jobs, side projects, all combined. I don't know much about marriage, or relationships, <a href="http://josh.works/blog/rules-for-fighting-fair">but please fight fair</a>.</p><p> </p><h3>Relationships II</h3><p>I feel like the luckiest guy to have a strong web of good friends and family around me. I can have a question about anything, and probably know someone that can answer it professionally, or can help me get that answer. (Doctors, lawyers, CPAs, generally wise people, etc.)</p><p>I used to think that personal relationships were of very little value. What a fool. Since then, I've come around and view them to be one of the most important parts of my life.</p><p> </p><h3>Work I</h3><p>I put work way down here because I aspire for it to belong way down here.&nbsp;I want it (and related side-projects) to <em>not</em>&nbsp;be the thing that provides my primary sense of meaning and satisfaction. I fail hard at this.&nbsp;</p><p>I work at <a target="_blank" href="http://litmus.com/">Litmus</a> on the Customer Success team. Litmus is a tool for email marketers, and I spend my days making sure all of our customers are getting as much value from the tool as possible. It is in some ways much more complicated than that, some ways quite simple.&nbsp;</p><p>My job done well means our customers stay with us for a long time, and are really happy to be with us.&nbsp;Litmus' success as a company is directly tied to the success of our customers.&nbsp;</p><p> </p><h3>WORK II</h3><p>My primary side-project is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.climbersguide.co/">The Climber's Guide</a>, which currently has made, to date, $59.97, or "several pennies per hour of effort I've expended". &nbsp;I'll write about growing this to a real income stream here.</p><p> </p><h3>Books and wisdom</h3><p><a href="http://josh.works/blog/limitations-of-my-own-thinking">My own thinking is severely limited</a>, and the best way to learn to think better is to learn from those who think clearly.</p><p>Wise men and women pour themselves into writing a good book, which you can consume for mostly-free, and a few hours of your time. Books are doors into other people's heads and hearts, or into entirely new worlds. I cannot state concisely all the reasons that I think you should read, but <a href="http://josh.works/blog/everything-i-do-and-think-ive-read-in-a-book-or-exploring-the-relationship-between-books-and-money">here's a good starting point</a>.</p><p>Oh, and I use a Kindle. <a href="http://josh.works/blog/2013/07/22/why-i-use-a-kindle">I think you should too</a>, but whatever it takes to help you read is fine with me.</p><h3> </h3><h3>Fitness</h3><p>The human body is amazing, and adaptable. If you could push a button and easily go through life with perfect physical health, you would. Statistically, most people are not in perfect physical health, so they deal with a huge range of maladies.</p><p>There are people out there who love exercise for the sake of exercise. While sometimes I feel like I can relate, usually I cannot. Anytime I think about exercise, I think about the time requirements compared to the benefit. Distance running immediately fails this evaluation, and <em>can all the runners out there admit to themselves that running is miserable?</em> The only reason some people <em>like</em> running is because it's miserable.</p><p>I love to be miserable, but only on my terms. (My "suffering of choice" is almost entirely focused on rock climbing. I write about it on <a target="_blank" href="http://climbersguide.co/">climbersguide.co</a>. Join me.)</p><p>There's no magic bullet, but there's a convenient way to get amazing exercise in just a few minutes, in the comfort of your own home. And body-weight <em>anything</em> doesn't cut it, unless it's related to pull-ups. Allow me to introduce <a href="http://josh.works/blog/2013/05/09/daily-exercise-russian-kettlebells">Russian Kettlebell Swings</a>.</p><p>If you were to do no other exercise for the rest of your life, but swing heavy kettle bells, you'd be in better shape than almost everyone you know, for only a modest time investment of 5-10 minutes, every other day.</p><p>Food is the other half of the fitness equation. It is also the more important part of the equation. They say "bodies are built in the kitchen", and they're right.</p><p>I don't know much about food, but <a href="http://josh.works/blog/2014/04/08/why-i-eat-bacon-every-day-and-you-should-too">I sure do have some opinions</a>.&nbsp;The FDA's food pyramid is complete crap, and you should probably be eating more fatty stuff and butter. Stop drinking sugar.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></h3><p>Writing here is purely an exercise to improve my own thinking. It'll be ugly. <a href="http://josh.works/blog/2015/7/22/type-publish-done">I'm OK with this</a>.</p><p>Comments/questions/criticisms?

      <title>What I'm Reading</title>
      <pubDate>Sun, 21 Jun 2015 18:11:34 +0000</pubDate>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align:center;">Currently Reading:</h3>
<p><em>I've put on hold my weekly book. I found that I often substituted taking action (good) with reading about taking action (not terrible) which lead me to take no action. (Very bad.)</em></p>
<p><em>I am still reading, but once I'm done with these books, I am prohibiting myself from reading more books until I meet a few internal goals. These include getting a new job and making real progress on two of my <a href="https://medium.com/busy-building-things/648223f673af">side projects.</a> (More details to come soon!)</em></p>
<p><strong>Its a surprising amount of work to keep this current. I've finished at least six books few weeks, and can't even remember between than and <em>Carrie</em>. I'm taking a break from updating this until I can find a better system.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Why bother?</h2>
<p>“Outside of a dog, a book is man's best friend. Inside of a dog it's too dark to read.”
― <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/43244.Groucho_Marx">Groucho Marx</a>,</p>
<p>In school, if you got all the answers to the tests ahead of time, you got in trouble. In life, they call you "wise". It's foolishness to pass up on the collective experience of the millions who have gone before you. Until you dive in, you don't know what you're missing.</p>
<p>This is not a comprehensive list, but much of what I've recently read is listed below.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">Finished Reading:</h3>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Carrie-Stephen-King/dp/0307743667">Carrie</a>, Stephen King</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Carrie is King's <em>first</em> book. I stumbled across it the book after seeing a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psrHRHEs8H8">creative movie trailer</a>. It's an excellent read.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1379035397&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=getting+things+done">Getting Things Done</a>, David Allen</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Super-classic. I'm hoping for great insights. This is critical reading for anyone who has to do things every day. Which should be everyone breathing.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Federalist-Papers-Alexander-Hamilton/dp/1441413049/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373082675&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+federalist+papers"><em>The Federalist Papers</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Does this even need explanation? I've never read them cover to cover, so I'm making up for lost time. 'Murica.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Christian-LIfe-Doctrinal-Introduction/dp/1848712596/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1379035429&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+christian+life+sinclair">The Christian Life</a>, Sinclair B Ferguson</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Highly recommended by my pastor (who has read it over eight times) so it got placed at the top of my list.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mathemagics-Genius-Without-Really-Trying/dp/0737300086">Mathemagics, </a>Arthur Benjamin</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">"The secret art of mental math" is the selling point of this book. There have not been many real-world applications for these skills, but I sure wish I had picked it up in middle school. I hated doing all the work on paper, and I did not like solving from right to left. ("Lets see... I know the answer ends with a 3" is less helpful then "I know the answer starts with eleven thousand")</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The real benefit has been from the short chapter on memorizing numbers. I won't get into the details here, but the author gives a very strong system for rapidly memorizing long numbers. I've used this to memorize street addresses, gate and flight numbers, and even a few critical phone numbers, all of which eliminate the need to constantly refer to the written word.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rework-Jason-Fried/dp/0307463745/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1379035323&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=rework">Rework</a>, Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">37 Signals runs an honorable business providing useful service to interested customers. A tremendously talented company that points out a lot of problems afflicting individuals and corporations. This book can be read in a sitting, but you should allot at least a few hours to think about it as you read.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Strategic-Customer-Service-Managing-Experience/dp/0814413331/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1379035655&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=customer+support">Strategic Customer Support</a>, John Goodman</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I do customer support, and there are a lot of things we could do better. Goodman makes a great case for seeing customer support not as a cost center but a revenue generator. Now if only I could get this book in the hands of more people...</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Freakonomics-Economist-Explores-Hidden-Everything/dp/0060731338/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1379035455&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=freakonomics">Freakanomics</a>, Stephen Levitt and Stephen Dubner</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">It's a classic, so I had to read it. I like that he doesn't follow traditional economic theories (besides being boring, they are usually wrong) but he's no Austrian, so he and I don't always see eye to eye. An entertaining read, none-the-less.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Gain-Disorder/dp/1400067820"><em>Antifragile, </em>Nassim Taleb</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">This is my second time through this book. If I could recommend only one book to just about anyone, this is it. The premise of the book is this: there is a whole class of things that <em>gain</em> from disorder and stress. It is foolishness for us (individually or as a society) to protect everything that we can from uncertainty, especially since some things are improved by uncertainty. When we do this, we set ourselves up for rare, but catastrophic events. This book ties well into De Soto's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Money-Bank-Credit-Economic-Cycles/dp/1610161890/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373082783&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Money%2C+Bank+Credit%2C+and+Economic+Cycles"><em>Money, Bank Credit, and Economic Cycles</em></a>. (Hint: Central banks exist to protect "regular" banks from the inevitable failure that must come because of fractional reserve banking. Central banks eventually pick up a liability so great even they cannot handle the burden. Example: America, circa 2013)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Will-Teach-You-To-Rich/dp/0761147489"><em>I Will Teach You To Be Rich, </em>Ramit Sethi</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">A personal finance blog for young folks. I get a lot of value from Ramit's blog, and this book is no exception. He focuses on the un-sexy but crucial items that go into having solid personal finance: Get out of credit card debt, max out an employer's match for a 401K, automate good spending habits, have good credit, and don't feel guilty about spending within your means. If you use some of this material to save a little better for retirement, or a trip you are taking, this book has thousands of dollars of value. Read it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Habits-Highly-Effective-People/dp/0743269519"><em>The Seven Habits of Highly Influential People</em>, Steven Covey</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">My reasons are easy. I want to be influential, and I like habits. It is almost embarrassing that I've not read this yet, because I've heard about it so much. My office has a bunch of good books sitting on a shelf, so I'm systematically working my way through 'em.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://mises.org/etexts/mises/bureaucracy.asp"><em>Bureaucracy</em>, Ludwig Von Mises</a></p>
<p>A neat little book by an influential thinker of the Austrian school of economics. If you agree with the Austrians, you'll probably love this book. If you don't, this isn't the best place to be introduced.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Golden-Ratio-Worlds-Astonishing-ebook/dp/B001L4Z6Q2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374532324&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+golden+ratio"><em>The Golden Ratio</em>, Mario Livio</a></p>
<p><em>Phi</em> is defined as the ratio between a line, and the same line broken into two segments where the first segment is to the second segment as the second segment is to the whole. And it's a whole book about it. There has been a long history of ancients trying to tie <em>the forms</em> to physical reality. In <em>The Golden Ratio</em>, Livio debunks most of those attempts, but then busts out an interesting chapter on fractals at the end. I skimmed the book (I'm not <em>that</em> nerdy) but unless you're really excited about obscure things, this is not recommended.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Retirement-Without-Winning-Lottery-ebook/dp/B008TW1BH2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374533383&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=saving+for+retirement"><em>Saving For Retirement, </em>Gail MarksJarvis</a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Retirement: if you're my age, this is probably not the most exciting thing you could talk about. That said, if you get started now, you can make good things happen with a lot less pain than you would otherwise. Get your ducks in a row, and dive in. Since we're supposed to rely upon the stock market to grow our money enough to retire, I recommend reading both <em>Money, Bank Credit, and Economic Cycles</em> and <em>Antifragile</em>. You might as well have a more nuanced perspective than "the stock market will absolutely grow on average of 10% a year because.... <em>it always has</em>."</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">No matter how you decide to sock money away for later, a pretty basic requirement for entering adulthood is figuring out how to manage what you have responsibly. So read this book. It's a good intro.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Money-Bank-Credit-Economic-Cycles/dp/1610161890/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373082783&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Money%2C+Bank+Credit%2C+and+Economic+Cycles"><em>Money, Bank Credit, and Economic Cycles</em>, Jesus Huerta de Soto</a></p>
<p>If the title didn't scare you off, keep reading. It's massive (almost 1000 pages) but no other book or individual has so clarified my understanding how how money functions in an economy. If you think this does not matter to you, just remember a wise quote that applies to poker, and the rest of life: "Look around the table; if you can't see the sucker, you're it."</p>
<p>Do you wonder why America's economy has alternated between boom and bust since the turn of the century? Ignore the damn Keynesians - they're wrong, and someday we'll call them on it. De Soto drops knowledge bombs the whole way through. I read only half the chapters, and about 1/3 of what I read was footnotes, so it's actually fairly quick reading. (If you don't read the footnotes.)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Stand-Stephen-King/dp/0307947300/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373082382&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+stand"><em>The Stand</em></a>, Steven King<em> </em><em></em></p>
<p>After reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/0143118072"><em>Paradise In Hell</em></a> I was interested in seeing how post-disaster communities are depicted in popular literature. A little poking around Amazon landed me on <em>The Stand</em>. The reviews rave, and I've not read much fiction lately, so I've jumped in with both feet.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Joy-Less-Minimalist-Living-Guide/dp/0984087311/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373082542&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=minimalism+live+a+meaningful+life"><em>The Joy of Less, </em>Francine Jay</a></p>
<p>We've been on a de-cluttering spree lately, so I figured I might read up on it. The book is pretty repetitive, but since we're all human, repetition can be exceedingly helpful. It's a quick read, and if you are impacted by her writing and make even small changes, over the course of a year or two, it could mean big changes. Read it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/0143118072"><em>A Paradise Built in Hell, </em>Rebecca Solnit</a></p>
<p>This is a book that for most people is purely academic, and for a few unfortunate souls (or perhaps fortunate?) could mean the difference between life and death. Since perception can equal reality, its worth your time figuring out what sort of society may arise in the wake of a disaster. Are you a Hobbesian "nasty, brutish, and short" sort of fellow? Guess what - you'll make it happen.</p>
<p>Perhaps you're more Lockean, and you think that organized society arises from the mutual interests of all men? Guess what - you can make that happen too.</p>
<p>Solnit warns against the dangers of "elite panic", which is when political elites panic about losing their power, and instruct the military to go out and prevent looting. Which almost never happens in a disaster anyway. ("Whoa. earthquake. No power. I'm totally going to score a 48" LCD now!" said no one, ever.)</p>
<p>This is one of the top two books I'm currently recommending. Please, read it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Never-Eat-Alone-Secrets-Relationship/dp/0385512058/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1371182170&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=never+eat+alone"><em>Never Eat Alone, </em>Kieth Ferazzi</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">It is worth repeating - relationships make the world go 'round. It behooves us all to spend more time out from behind a screen (ahem. As this is created and consumed from behind a screen) and more time in front of real people. This is not the end-all book on building relationships, but it's a quick read, and contains a lot of useful material. Even if you don't read it, pour more effort into relationships. It's effort that can never be wasted. Usually.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Think-Grow-Rich-Original-Unedited/dp/193764135X"><em>Think and Grow Rich</em>, Napoleon Hill</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Hill writes a doozy. It was published in '37, and at times seems a bit hokey, but the core is this: If you want something really, really bad, you can make it happen. Just don't accept anything less than success. He spends a lot of time talking about how man can manipulate the ether with his thoughts, but if you exchange "ether" with "the power of mindsets, framing, and heuristics", the book holds water. It's been around for 70 years - that in and of itself is worth quite a lot.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Liars-Poker-Rising-Through-Wreckage/dp/0739357301"><em>Liar's Poker</em>, Michael Lewis</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Who here loves Wall Street and trusts them to hold America's interests at heart? Hm. How about politicians? No one? I wonder why.  Lewis writes about his experience with the hottest investment banking firm in its hey-day. If you thought it was boring, just imagine what <em>you</em> would do with a company credit card good for a few million. It's a good read.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Escape-From-Cubicle-Nation-Entrepreneur/dp/B003VYBEK2"><em>Escape from Cubical Nation</em>, Pamela Slim</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Is there life outside the cubical? Yes. Start planning your departure now. Slim is inspirational, but IMO speaking to too wide an audience - the book applies to everyone, but is understandably light on specifics.
If you've not yet been convinced that you should not spend your whole life working for someone else, this is worth your time. If you already know this, it's not worth reading.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Game-Thrones-Song-Fire-Book/dp/0553573403"><em>Game of Thrones</em></a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Game-Thrones-Song-Fire-Book/dp/0553573403">, George R.R. Martin</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">These are some long books, with insanely complex political relationships. I sort of gave up on the series half way through the fourth book. I wanted more dragons, more magic, and more Others.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="Season One Omnibus"><em>The Returners</em>, Mikey Neumann</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>The Returners</em> started out as a chapter-by-chapter fan-directed experiment, and concluded with the most amazing mix of historical and fictional characters ever assembled on the same planet. It's excellent, and very, very unconventional. (Want to know how Peter the Great and Joan of Ark would interact if they lived at the same time? Read this book.)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Deep-State-Government-Secrecy-Industry/dp/1118146689"><em>Deep State: Inside the Government Secrecy Industry,</em> Ambinder and Grady</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">A casual examination of how all things "secret" work in the US government. The authors clearly side on the side of the government, and avoid some ethical issues I wish they had covered. Interesting, but not recommended.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Intellectuals-Society-Expanded-Thomas-Sowell/dp/0465025226/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373087043&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=intellectuals+and+society"><em>Intellectuals and Society</em>, Thomas Sowell</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Thomas Sowell is the man; he's written a lot, and I've read most, so eventually his books sort of blend together. <em>Intellectuals and Society</em> instills a healthy dose of skepticism for the proclamations of experts and intellectuals. Since most experts think they are right, and that the world would be a better place if we followed their policy recommendations, you are doing yourself and your country a service by being wary of those experts and intellectuals.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The book does run into difficult spots when Sowell uncritically accepts his own positions, while attacking those who disagree with him, but since its his book, and he spends plenty of time elsewhere building a coherent worldview, this is not a big deal.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I love Thomas Sowell, and if you had a short list of authors everyone should read, he'd unarguably be on that list.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Americas-Great-Depression-Murray-Rothbard/dp/146793481X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373229337&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=America%27s+Great+Depression"><em>America's Great Depression, </em>Murray Rothbard</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">This is<em> </em><em>the</em> explanation for why the Great Depression happened. For all the concern modern politicians have for avoiding another great depression, you would wonder if anyone bothered mentioning <em>it's already been figured out</em>.
This truth would be inconvenient, however, because in their fervor to avoid a great depression, they are taking steps that will virtually guarantee future depressions. It's cool to be Keynesian, though, if you're a politician. Arrogant power aggregation gets re-labeled "helping".</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="Innovation and Entrepreneurship"><em>Innovation and Entrepreneurship, </em>Peter Drucker</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Published in the mid-80s, he was talking about intentional innovation between "iterate", "pivot", and "intra-preneur" were common words. If you want to innovate, this is a good place to get started.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=Outside%20In%3A%20The%20Power%20of%20Putting%20Customers%20at%20the%20Center%20of%20Your%20Business"><em>Outside In: The Power of Putting Customers at the Center of Your Business,</em> Manning, Bodine, Bernhoff</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">This book is groundbreaking, and changed my life. It helped me tie a common thread through all the initiatives I've taken at any job I've had - I seek to help businesses better serve customers, and this book, published by <a href="http://www.forrester.com/home">Forrester Research</a>, makes a powerful business case for doing just that. They argue, persuasively, that customer satisfaction is ultimately what differentiates a very successful business and a bankrupt business.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Names-Don-Delillo/dp/0679722955"><em>The Names, </em>Don Dilillo</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">This is supposedly one of Dilillo's best works. Genre defining, meditative, thought-provoking, etc. I have no doubt it's all of these things, because a lot of people said so, but it wasn't for me. I just couldn't get into it, and stopped reading about half-way through. (Reading tip #1: Never finish a book you don't want to. There are too many good books, and not enough time, to justify reading books you don't want to read.)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Will-Teach-You-Be-Rich/dp/0761147489/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373587053&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=i+will+teach+you+to+be+rich"><em>I Will Teach You To Be Rich, </em>Ramit Sethi</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">This book, more than most, could change your life. If you're finances are not in complete control, Sethi will help you get there. If your finances are controlling you, <em>read this book</em>. He's got an ego, but doesn't write BS. He will help you get to a better place, and being in a bad financial spot darkens your outlook on <em>everything else</em>. Don't be too unaware, passive, or scared to get started. Right now. Click the link, buy the book. If you feel guilty spending the $10 you'll need to buy it used and ship it, let me know. I'll cover half the cost. Seriously.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Catch-Me-If-You-Can/dp/0767905385/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373587230&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Catch+Me+If+You+Can"><em>Catch Me If You Can, </em>Frank Abagnale</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Please read this book. It's the story of a <em>true fake</em>, popularized by the movie of the same title. Not only an interesting story, Abagnale's story lends credence to the idea that "confidence is <em>almost</em> everything." I couldn't put the book down, and read it in about two days. It's a true story about one of the best (and youngest) scammers of the century. Oh, and he started when he was 16.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stiff-Curious-Lives-Human-Cadavers/dp/0393324826/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373587532&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Stiff%3A+The+Curious+Lives+of+Human+Cadavers"><em>Stiff, </em>Mary Roach</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">A story about the "curious lives of human cadavers". Since I never thought much about what happened with people when they died (not heaven vs. hell, but more "burial vs. cremation vs. lab vs. other options) I was pleased to stumble across this book. There's a bit of historical perspective (I pity the recently-beheaded persons who were forced to endure tapping on the head and loud noises to see if they still responded...) along with humor. If you want to pick up some trivia that will leave everyone wondering if you're a sociopath, this is a good start.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/All-Names-Jose-Saramago/dp/0156010593/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373587718&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=All+the+Names"><em>All the Names</em>, Jose Saramago</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The first thing you'll notice in this book is the missing paragraph indentations, quotation marks, and a whole lot of run-on sentences. Saramago writes through the eyes of an almost-mindless bureaucrat who works in the National Registry. After the book, you will feel like you have a new friend, one who you very much wish you could meet and spend time with. If it looks interesting to you, give it a read. If not, you won't be any worse for not reading it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Lie-Statistics-Darrell-Huff/dp/0393310728/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373587977&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=how+to+lie+with+statistics+by+darrell+huff"><em>How to Lie with Statistics</em>, Darrell Huff</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">You know how you can find a study that says anything? This book will help you understand why, and help you arm yourself against the credentialed elite trying to pull the wool over your eyes. (Or anyone else, for that matter.) It's a short book, but <em>extremely</em> worthwhile.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Liars-Outliers-Enabling-Society-Thrive/dp/1118143302/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373588137&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Liars+and+Outliers%3A+Enabling+the+Trust+that+Society+Needs+to+Thrive"><em>Liars and Outliers, </em>Bruce Schneier</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Perfect security is an illusion. Bruce Schneier runs a terrific <a href="http://www.schneier.com/">blog</a>, and invented the term "security theater", which applies to, among other things, the Transportation Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security. I really cannot put the words together that describe out insightful this book is. If you want to know more about security in a society, and have a better BS detector for politicians, read this book. If you're still reading this paragraph, click the link and read the Amazon reviews. Really.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/End-Fed-Ron-Paul/dp/0446549177/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373588584&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=end+the+fed"><em>End the Fed</em>, Ron Paul</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Dr. Paul is polarizing, to say the least. No matter where you stand in relation to his politics, his book will help you better understand the role the Federal Reserve plays in our nation. And that role is large. (At the time of me writing this, the Fed pumps in $85 billion <em>a month</em> into the economy. Please find another federal agency that exerts a larger or more behind-the-scenes influence in our nation)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Causes-Economic-Crisis-Essays-Depression/dp/1933550031/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373588764&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+Causes+of+the+Economic+Crisis%3A+And+Other+Essays+Before+and+After+the+Great+Depression"><em>The Causes of the Economic Crisis,</em> Ludwig von Mises</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">America has been in a slump of late, in case you've not heard. Would you like to be smarter than this nation's leading economists? Read this book. Mises saw this coming a <em>long</em> time ago. He is an incredible thinker, and this book will make you feel ill, when you reflect on today's economic policies. If you don't want to feel ill, you probably should not read anything by Mises.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Law-ebook/dp/B001B5VPXY/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373589118&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+law"><em>The Law,</em> Frederic Bastiat</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Written in the 1840s, as a response to socialism in France, this is book packs a powerful punch in just 60 pages. If someone printed up a few million and air-dropped them on DC, the proof they're good would be that politicians would be running to keep this book out of the hands of the citizens. Bastiat reflects on the role in society law plays, and discusses (with great wit) perversions of the law. Every legislator in public office needs to read this book and regularly publish how their current endeavors further the proper application of law. Every citizen needs to read this book and ask their representatives some difficult questions. Please, read this book.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Personal-MBA-Business-ebook/dp/B0046ECJ8M/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373589426&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+Personal+MBA%3A"><em>The Personal MBA</em>, Josh Kaufman</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">There are two paths to a higher education - first, you can pay someone else to take a lot of time and money to teach you things you need to know. Or, you can spend a lot less time and money and learn the stuff yourself. Even if you have no interest in an MBA (and zero interest you should have!) this book will put you in a better place when it comes to building businesses, no matter what your role within that business is. Oh, and remember - you get paid based on how much value you deliver to your business. If you suddenly start delivering more value, you're in a strong position to earn more. "Seniority" is a terrible reason for a raise. "Delivers results and improves bottom line" is compelling.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Still Reading?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Listed above are most of the books I've read on my Kindle, and may eventually encompass physical books (the records for those are <em>much</em> harder to come by.) If you're reading this, scroll back up and pick a book or two to read. It will do you far more good than reading the thoughts I have about them.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Oh, and I don't do affiliate links. Even if half the traffic on this blog (Hi Mom!) bought every book on this list, I'd probably earn something like $2. Hardly worth the time and effort it would take to set that up.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Tackle Fear</title>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Aug 2015 23:40:34 +0000</pubDate>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Climbing rocks, but being scared out of your mind sucks.</p><p>Even when you’re not scared out of your mind (oh, that’s just me?)<em> it’s frustrating to not meet your own goals of trying hard</em>. When you can’t send your project, you wish you could at least gun it at the end and make those last few moves rather than dejectedly letting go.</p><p><em>A good hold is just three moves (and a scary clip) away! Why do I hesitate, give a half-hearted “throw”, and drop off the wall?!?!</em></p><p>That thought process rolls through my head more often than I'd like to admit.</p><p>There’s a few bits of psychology that go into the decisions you make when you are feeling fear (either consciously or unconsciously), but <em>today I want to dig into something that isn’t in your own head. It’s how well you (and by extension, your partner) belay. </em></p><p><strong>Here is proof that the quality of your belayer is very important to you (especially if you think any belayer will do)</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>You would not let </strong><em>someone who does not rock climb</em><strong> belay you</strong>. They don’t have the minimum skills required, right?</p></li><li><p><strong>You would let a newbie belay you, </strong><em>but you wouldn’t climb a challenging route</em><strong>.</strong> They have not proven themselves to be trustworthy yet.</p></li></ol><p>When you (and your belayer) learned to belay, you quickly moved through the "newbie belayer" stage, and achieved a certain level of proficiency. <em>You probably have not gotten much better at belaying since than.</em></p><p>Here is a quick guide to being an amazing belayer. There are other things that matter, but if you (and your belayer) keep the following three principles in mind, you will have proven to your climber (and vice versa) that they are in good hands when run out, chicken winging, and are deciding between clipping the bolt or going for the jug.</p><p> </p><h1 class="text-align-center">Stand in the right spot</h1><p>Don’t stand more than <em>one large step</em> from directly beneath the bolt. (I’m talking about a traditional indoor climbing gym where bolts are generally 12 feet (3 meters) high or lower.</p><p>When the climber is low to the ground, stand to one side so the rope does not <em>ever</em> lie between their legs. Imagine they fell right after clipping the first bolt. If they could end up straddling the rope, you need to move.</p><p>In the below gif, compare the left side (bad) with the right (good). Same climb, similar clipping stance, but if the climber fell right after clipping, she’d not be happy on the left.</p><p><br /> </p>

      <img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/t/55c7e402e4b049b5abb3c4b3/1439163425707/standing_wrong.gif?format=original" alt=""/>


<h1 class="text-align-center"> </h1><h1 class="text-align-center">Move around as needed</h1><p>Just like your climber is moving on the wall (I hope) so too should you, as the belayer, move around. There are a few different situations where you should move around, but the most common (and predictable) is when your climber is clipping.</p><p>On the left, the belayer steps towards the wall to create a little more slack. (This also has the benefit of allowing her to quickly take slack out of the system if needed just by stepping back.)</p><p>On the right, she doesn’t move at all. This is the difference between being able to clip without getting short roped, and getting short roped. This movement is also an indicator of an attentive belayer. So when your climber is clipping, get in the habit of stepping into the wall to give them a little more slack. (There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, but you’ve got to know the rules in order to know when to break them, right?)</p>

<p><br /> </p><h1 class="text-align-center">When your climber “gets air” and takes a whip, you should too.</h1><p>I’ve saved the best for last. When your climber falls (which should be common) you need to “give a soft catch” to keep them from “getting spiked” because <em>f=m*v^2</em> and other such jargon.</p><p>Just watch these a few times:</p>

      <img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/t/55c7e4b8e4b061ce4569b5bc/1439163609139/compare_catches.gif?format=original" alt=""/>


<p><br />Which one looks more comfortable? Watch, again, carefully. What is the climber doing with her hands? Her feet? What happens to the belayer?</p><p>The climber is “getting a soft catch” on the left. She is “getting spiked” on the right. &nbsp;</p><p>If she were working a really hard move and had to take that fall five or six times in a row, which one do you think would inspire confidence? Which one would make her leery of falling?</p><p>The only difference between these is that the belayer gave a hop on the left, and did not give a hop on the right.</p><p>Now what?</p><p>These are three changes you can make to your belaying next time you put your harness on. Send this to your belayer, so they can improve too. Once you’ve both made these changes, you’ll feel a little more confident next time you are on the wall.</p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

Right now. You're speaking lies to yourself.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_146326">How about another question. Are you fit, or are you intelligent?</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_146329">Ah. "You can intelligent <em>and </em>fit", you say. You can train one or the other. Yet don't we usually guide people towards one or the other? Jocks? Geeks?</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_146335">Here's another "dichotomy" that doesn't hold up in the real world - "right brained/left brained". Creative vs. concrete thinkers. But I digress...</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_146338">Josh Spodek blew my mind when he wrote that <a href="http://joshuaspodek.com/introversion-opposite-extroversion">introversion is not the opposite of extroversion</a>. Believing that you are one or the other allows folks to slack of in areas of their life that are difficult. This is a shame, because usually that thing that's the hardest for you is the best way for you to grow in a short period of time.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_146344">If you never exercise, you can realize incredible gains in a short period of time. Your percentage of growth in a month could be ten times that of a professional athlete continuing to train. Along those same lines, if you are all jock, and never do "brainy stuff", you can learn and grow a lot just by finishing a few books.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_146347">This holds true for interpersonal skills. If you can't talk to people IRL, two hours of (difficult but rewarding) effort could mark a turning point in your life.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_146350">If you don't like being alone by yourself, the best thing for you may be sitting alone by yourself.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_146353">Please don't sell yourself, or anyone else, short by believing lies about introversion and extroversion.</p>

      <title>The Difficult Work of Making it Easy</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/06/10/the-difficult-work-of-making-it-easy</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago I started writing a list, and it very quickly became very long. All it was was a list of things I would like to do. Most of the things would fit neatly into categories labeled <em>self-improvement, job/income, </em>or <em>relationships.</em>
Within those categories, I'm usually trying to develop either competence or freedom.</p>
<p>As I look through the list (I'll publish it here soon) I'm struck by how much willpower and effort could be expended, completing even half the items on that list. While few things on the list are objectively difficult, as a whole, it's a very daunting concept.</p>
<p>So, rather than attacking items head on, I want to be strategic. I don't want to get good at doing hard things. I want to get good at making hard things easy.</p>

      <title>Krav Maga, or "Crush Balls, Gouge Eyes, and Break Bones"</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/06/17/krav-maga-or-crush-balls-gouge-eyes-and-break-bones</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the last few weeks, I have been physically attacked dozens of times. Usually the attacker was just trying to choke me, but sometimes he was trying to throw me to the ground. After a few minutes of fighting, I would attack him. Then we'd both shake hands, say "thank you", and walk to the metro.<!--more-->
My wife and I have always recognized a need (or a strong desire) for some sort of self-defense training. I've always wanted some, because I don't like the idea that my only option to protect myself is "run away". That would not always an option, nor does it help anyone other than me.</p>
<p>Kristi often felt uncomfortable walking many places in DC by herself, especially at night. Metro platforms, parking garages, gas stations, or any place where you're not alone can be scary places.</p>
<p>The way I saw it was this: We're not training to protect ourselves against a low-probability incident, but rather we're training to provide peace and comfort in situations where before we may have been nervous or on edge, because ITSHTF, we have options that, if executed correctly, leave us safe.</p>
<p>The top of my <a href="/blog/2013/06/14/the-list" title="The List">Epic List</a> is Krav Maga. My wife and I are taking lessons at Krav Maga DC, in China Town. We go between two and four times a week, for an hour each lesson.</p>
<p>We signed up for a year of classes, which usually gets students to a solid level of proficiency. The classes are structured in week-long "blocks", where a single new element is focused on, for the week. Recent topics have been learning to use "hammer fists", elbow strikes, and defenses from chokes and head locks. I feel far from proficient, but we've been going for just a few weeks. (By the way, every defense includes usually a "crush the groin" step, and "gouge the eyeball" or "collapse the windpipe".)</p>
<p>Krav focuses on real-life situations and instinctual offensive reactions to attacks. The goal is to, if attacked, not just respond and be safe, but leave the other guy unable to get off the ground to prosecute the attack any farther. (This is called "ending the fight", and is brutal. Yes, you are expected to kick 'em when they're down.) Anything goes, because if attacked, you're probably smaller than your attacker, weaker, and much less prepared for what's going on. (If I were attacking someone, I'd make sure to be bigger, stronger, and mentally prepared for the attack. Wouldn't you?)</p>
<p>We're having a blast, and this is a solid step towards checking off an item on my list. If anyone wants to join with us, it's <a href="http://www.kravmagadc.com/www/index.php?p=home">Krav Maga DC, </a>by the Gallery Place/Chinatown metro. There are a lot of training centers in the area, though, so if you're interested, make time in your schedule, your budget, and make it happen. You'll always have other things to do with your time and money, but if this is something important to you, it'll happen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Do Not Work in Isolation</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/10/28/do-not-work-in-isolation</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I fear criticism. I don't have nightmares about it, and I'm not (too) crippled by a desire to avoid it, but I absolutely don't like criticism, or being disappointing, or any of those things.
If my ego were making all decisions, I would move even slower than I do today into "new" territory. I probably wouldn't read much, or try new things, or meet people. I'd play a lot of video games. (Actually... it's embarrassing to be pwnd by 13 year old boys when playing online - maybe I've left video games to protect my ego.)</p>
<p>I go to great, sneaky lengths to avoid criticism. I'll even do things like this (talk about fearing criticism) to avoid doing other things <em>that will expose me to criticism and rejection.</em> Seriously. I'm avoiding criticism right now by writing this.</p>

<p>Reid Hoffman said that. He built LinkedIn. Regardless of how much you dislike LinkedIn, it's an impressive accomplishment.</p>
<p>To this end, I'm working on a small project over at www.belaybetter.com. The task I am avoiding right now is reaching out through my network to get in touch with people I've never met, to talk to them about lead climbing, falling, and fear. This would be my second "pilot group" to discuss the material with. This will also be the first group that I don't personally know.</p>
<p>My biggest fear is that I'll reach out and no one will write back. I fear rejection. It's easier to "work" on this project in isolation. It's not scary to do that. But I know getting feedback from real people (silence is feedback) is far, far more helpful to me right now than additional isolated work. (If you lead climb, I'd love to talk to you - shoot me an email (thompsonjoshd,gmail) or <a href="https://twitter.com/thompsonjoshd">tweet at me</a> or something.)</p>
<p>Every time I've ever reached out to anyone to get help on a given project, it's been intimidating, scary, and 100x more helpful than any other single action I could have taken. (Side note - the best money you can ever spend is to treat a wise old(er) person to coffee/lunch/dinner to pick their brain about what they've done. Do they have a good marriage? Ask about it. Are they accomplished at work? Ask why. Do they have skills? Ask how they built them. Do they seem to enjoy life? Ask about it.)</p>
<p>I guess I should stop avoiding criticism now...</p>

      <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:16px">I fear criticism. I don't have nightmares about it, and I'm not (too) crippled by a desire to avoid it, but I absolutely don't like criticism, or being disappointing, or any of those things. If my ego were making all decisions, I would move even slower than I do today into "new" territory. I probably wouldn't read much, or try new things, or meet people. I'd play a lot of video games. (Actually... it's embarrassing to be pwnd by 13 year old boys when playing online - maybe I've left video games to protect my ego.)</span></p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>You always end with a great summarizing thought! Such a good writer!  You never enjoyed team sports, though I don't think it was ever to avoid criticism. You told me it was because you didn't like depending on others to win, but enjoyed competing against yourself at bicycling, archery, weight lifting, paint balling, roller blading (though that one took some convincing, you may recall!), skiing, shooting, and, oh yeah, rock climbing! You always won, working hard, improving, excelling!  Hey, just wondering how you developed this fear of criticism if you would probably say I go to the other extreme and always encourage! A topic for dinner together some time!  Love you!  CAY  PS Hey, are you the author of Zen Climbing?</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>Can You Recover From Months (YEARS!) of Not Climbing?</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/10/19/can-you-recover-from-months-years-of-not-climbing</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe5fe4b0278244cea1e3/1434910448785/2014-10-11-09-44-17.jpg" alt=""/>


<p>A few weeks ago, I headed into the gym thinking that I felt a little off-kilter. I'd not climbed in a week, I though, and maybe I was getting weaker or something. Turns out that wasn't the problem - I had actually been climbing too much, and was feeling it.
This is an odd mistake, because I've recently had the opportunity to end a <em>twenty</em> month hiatus from climbing, and I've felt nothing but good as I ease back into the sport.</p>
<p>I had felt strong when I stopped climbing in 2012, and I felt comparatively weak when I got back into a regular routine two months ago. For perspective, my max onsight dropped a full number grade, and my bouldering fell four grades. As you would expect, my "endurance" was more wishful thinking than anything else. This was all a <em>substantial</em> decrease in ability. That's the bad news, and it's just as bad for you, whenever you take a break.<!--more--></p>
<p>Here's the good news - everything else I had learned while climbing I could still use (though it needed a little brushing up.) I had the footwork I had when I had climbed much stronger. I still remembered how to use dynamic movement, and pace myself while climbing. You still have these things too.</p>
<p>Here's the best news - your body "remembers" what it could once do. As long as you still weigh what you once did, you should be able to re-train yourself to that level of fitness fairly quickly.</p>
<p>So, if you're getting back on the horse from a long break - please don't feel discouraged. Get after it. Be excited to be climbing again, rather than disappointed you are not climbing what you used to. You'll be there soon enough.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Graduated in May! I'll be working in the DC area for a year, so I've been climbing at the New as much as possible - every weekend, pretty much. It's done wonders.
I like the Andersons' training philosophy, and it seems grounded in good science, but it's very committing. I don't know if I'm at the stage where I'm willing to sacrifice so much actual climbing time in favor of training time.</p>
<p>I would love to climb in CO! Circumstances permitting, of course.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

Don't hold your breath on any 5.14 sends yet, but maybe, in time, that will happen. The Rock Climber's Training Manual (it's a book) is fantastic, and takes the long view on training. I hope to see 5.14 go down some day.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

<p>Hello!
We met recently. (I gave Justin tape after he cut his toe and didn't have a bandaid.)</p>
<p>You and your partner were climbing a route near me and my partner. One of you (I'll call Charles, because he had a British accent) was trying <em>so hard </em>to figure out some moves high above his last bolt. He was scared to fall. Very scared. Yet he kept trying. I was impressed with Charles' tenacity.</p>
<p>The other one (I'll call you Justin) sort of screwed over Charles. You sent him up a climb that was too hard for him to do, and you didn't let him back off the climb. You made it <em>sound</em> like if he didn't finish, you were not going to be able to get your quickdraws back.</p>
<p>Charles was scared, and you offered no consolation.</p>
<p>The above is excusable. What happened next is not.<!--more--></p>
<p>Charles fell. And you, Justin, almost dropped him. My partner and I watched in horror as Charles fell from 50 feet up to about fifteen feet. You lost control of the break strand and got it back just before Charles decked. <i>And you never even apologized.</i></p>
<p>I don't think Charles even realized he'd been dropped. You must have not told him anything about how falling on lead works. If you had, he would have known something terribly wrong happened.</p>
<p>I know why you dropped Charles. You were distracted. You hurt yourself when you hit the wall last time he fell, so you were paying more attention to not crashing into the wall than anything else. You were trying to keep track of a lot of moving pieces. But it's inexcusable to drop your climber.</p>
<p>Why this letter? I want this to be a learning experience. I'm sure you've both learned a lot, but I'm afraid Charles is learning that climbing is difficult, scary, and dangerous. You are learning disdain for those who are not as strong as you.</p>
<p>There's a better way.</p>
<p>You obviously don't want to hurt anyone while lead climbing (and belaying) but you also want to have fun, right? It did not look like either of you were having much fun.</p>
<p>I want you to have fun climbing. I want you to climb as hard as you can. And I want you to do this all safely. We'll cover how to make this happen soon, but for now - please know it is possible for <i>both</i> of you, both Charles and Justin, to have so much more fun climbing, and to climb so much harder. Even if you can't imagine climbing without fear right now, stick with me, and we'll get you there.</p>
<p>Until next time,</p>
<p>-Josh</p>

      <title>Why Your Belayer is Keeping You from Climbing Hard(er)</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/09/30/why-your-belayer-is-keeping-you-from-climbing-harder</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since climbing regularly again (!!!), I've observed lots of belaying in the gym. I can't walk up to a stranger and say "Excuse me, sir, I noticed that your poor belaying is totally crippling your climber's ability to try hard, and actively eliminating any hope you had of improvement in this sport."
In fact, I don't even want to. When I see bad belaying, it doesn't bother me, unless it's actively courting grave injury. It does make me feel sorry for the climbers, though, because it's really hard to improve at climbing with a bad belayer.</p>
<p>There's a number of issues surrounding poor belaying, but they all tie back to either <em>trust </em>or <em>competence</em>.<!--more--></p>
<p>The two <em>can</em> operate independent of each other. You can have a competent belayer that you don't trust, or you can trust an incompetent belayer (whoops). Or, of course, you can not trust an incompetent belayer (good idea) or, finally, trust a competent belayer. (Nirvana!).</p>
<p>While you can easily spot signs of an incompetent belayer, it's much harder to determine if they are competent. Then, even if you've established their competence, it takes time to build trust in them.</p>
<p>Here's why bad belaying keeps you from improving - even if you don't actively consider the skill of your belayer, your subconscious knows if they are competent and trustworthy. And if you've not actively considered their skill, you probably don't trust them, and they may be incompetent.</p>
<p>Here are some indicators of unskilled (and untrustworthy) belaying:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lets the rope hang between the climber's legs when climber is lower than the third bolt.</li>
<li>Short ropes climber <em>and doesn't know it.</em></li>
<li>Spikes the climber <em>and doesn't know it.</em></li>
<li>Keeps rope too tight or too loose.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now - all of these are easily fixed. So - this is where <em>trust</em> comes in. If your belayer is making these mistakes, and is either unaware or unwilling to fix them, why would you trust them? None of these mistakes puts the climber in grave danger, but all can make climbing <i>much</i> less fun.</p>
<p>If your belayer is competent, and makes none of the above errors, that's enough to make you think they're not only competent, but trustworthy as well. Without <em>trusting</em> your belayer, you cannot push yourself hard enough to improve at climbing.</p>
<p>There's a whole other list related to trustworthy belaying.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Three Levels of Competence</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/09/29/three-levels-of-competence</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Raise your hand if you'd like to be better at climbing.
Yeah. Me too.</p>
<p>I've spent an unusual amount of time working with beginners, to help them improve at climbing. I've also worked a lot with (what I would consider to be) intermediate climbers, so <i>they </i>can get better. I've certainly watched <em>advanced </em>climbers do their thing, but I'm not sure how much I have to offer to them.</p>
<p>My quick observation about climbing, existing skill levels, and improvement is this:</p>
<p>At a most basic level, a climber needs to build movement skills, and needs to learn to belay. Strength is not a big part of this equation, because most "easy" climbing is not a function of strength, but technique. Fortunately, just by building this base of movement skills, the climber will get stronger.</p>
<p>I would expect a beginner climber to learn the basics of hip rotation, flagging/smearing, and climbing with straight arms. Everything else is icing on the cake.</p>
<p>As far as technical skills, a beginner should be able to top rope belay.</p>
<p>Once the climber has mastered the above skills, they're a solid candidate for being an intermediate climber. Movement skills will be refined, especially as climbs take the feet farther and farther out from under the climber. (Not necessarily due to steepness, but due to large horizontal movements.) This will place more stress on the upper body, so the climber will keep getting stronger. The climber will get comfortable with side pulls, gastons, heel hooks, and all those fun things. (Including all the movements we have to do that defy categorization. The beached whale, anyone?)</p>
<p>Our climber will also be picking up additional technical skills. The climber will learn to lead belay and lead climb, and starts getting into the mental game that permeates this strange sport.</p>
<p>So far, I've not mentioned anything about grade. How hard does our climber need to climb to be considered intermediate?</p>
<p>I don't know. I am of the opinion that if they can handle the above technical skills, they'll find themselves climbing harder grades. I'm hesitant to put a grade on any stage for many reasons, but mostly because focusing on technique will carry us all farther than focusing on grades.</p>
<p>An easy example is the mythical grade of 5.12. Most people don't think they are STRONG enough to climb 5.12, but I think most people just are not good enough at climbing to climb 5.12. The strength comes as they improve their technique. If someone just tries to get really really strong, without focusing on their technique, they'll never get anywhere.</p>
<p>Phew. Brain dump. All done.</p>
<p>Oh yeah - that third level? That's advanced climbers. Not sure what their defining characteristics are, but I'll let you know when I get there. :)</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Be Gentle to You</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_153905">There are many types of people in the world, all with different approaches to "getting stuff done". My approach to doing stuff is different from my wife's approach. (Who'da thunk?)
These two years of marriage have revealed much. One of these "revelations" was this: my sense of worth is closely tied to how well I think I'm accomplishing tasks and goals, across a broad spectrum. In some ways, this is good. I set goals, plan how to accomplish them, and even manage to compete a few percentage points of these goals.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_153908">The downsides <em>were</em> subtle, and two-fold:</p><ol id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_153914"><li><strong>Since my sense of worth is tied to accomplishments, I evaluate others in the same way.</strong> Imagine being married to someone who only acts like they love you if you're industrious and productive. Yikes!</li><li><strong>Since my sense of worth is tied to accomplishments, I feel guilt and shame when I fail to meet whatever standards I have.</strong> This cycle feeds itself, so I'll either work harder, sort of like penance, or I'll fall deeper into guilt and shame.</li></ol><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_153924">I said these downsides <em>were </em>subtle, because until about a year ago, I was blind to this thinking. This led to strife in my marriage, as Kristi would feel like I didn't delight in her unless she was working on some side project. I couldn't figure out why I wasn't delighting in her. (Pro tip: While true, saying "I'm choosing to love you." is not always romantic. The counterargument: "So you have to <em>choose</em>?")</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_153933">Here's where I would normally want to put next action steps for fixing these problems. The first step to dealing with this was realizing I couldn't self-help my way out of it. <a href="http://marshill.com/the-gospel">The Gospel</a> speaks to these issues in a far deeper way than anything else can.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_153939">In sum: I am deeply broken. So is Kristi. And we can rejoice in this truth.</p><img src="http://www.discovermoab.com/images/arches/a01.jpg" title="" alt="So small from far away."/>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>My constant prayer for my family (YOU!) is that you would know how precious and valuable you are to God and therefore to me. It sounds a bit like an "I am choosing to love you" statement, like "You are precious and valuable to me only because you are precious and valuable to God," but I think you understand, based on your "choosing to love you" statement that is somewhat similar. On its surface, our statements sound like our love is conditional, but, on the contrary, this love and value is rooted and grounded in God's love and value for the one we love, and, in my case, makes a foundation of love for my family which is NOT based on their goal setting and performance, but on being His creation! That is why I hesitate to say "I'm proud of you," because to me it sounds like it sends the message that my satisfaction with you is based on your performance, which it is not, so, though I say it sometimes, I am never sure if it sends the wrong message! I have been trying to come up with a way to say that without sounding conditional in my satisfaction with your accomplishments. I will try harder!  Love,  CAY  PS Great pictures!</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>A 40 Hour Work Week</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/07/17/a-40-hour-work-week</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Business Insider posted an article on why we have a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-real-reason-for-the-40-hour-workweek-2014-6">40 hour work week</a>.
The author blames big business for why we've not dropped below 40 hours per week. He thinks that if America became less consumer-driven, our economy would collapse.</p>
<p>He's got the wrong starting assumptions about what is good and bad for an economy, but he's right that a 40 hour work week is unnecessarily strict, and counter-productive. Many full-time office workers would love to work "only" 40 hours, and once you tack in the occasional nine hours of work, plus lunch, plus commuting, most of us spend 11 hours a day getting ready for, traveling to and from, or existing at, work.</p>
<p>One way to gain control over your life is to reduce commuting time. I'm obviously a fan of working remotely, at least part of your work week.</p>
<p>Beyond this, though, is the idea that work only gets done in forty hours a week, and between the hours of nine and five. Jason Fried, founder of a very successful, privately held, fully remote company argues that <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/jason_fried_why_work_doesn_t_happen_at_work">work doesn't happen at work</a>. I agree. Work also doesn't happen in the intervals we think it does.</p>
<p>Time and time again it has been found that constraints improve workflow. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing">Timeboxing</a> is enormously effective when trying to complete specific, well-defined bits of work. <a href="http://www.redguava.com.au/jobs/">RedGuava</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">SaaS</a> company in New Zealand works just 30 hours a week. We could call them lazy, but isn't that confusing effort with result?</p>
<p>They've built a fantastic product, and do so while living their life, rather than deferring <em>everything </em>until retirement.</p>
<p>I would love to see more experiments with shorter work weeks, to see how it affects work that gets done. You could do half-day Fridays, or seven-hour days. Both of these would trim a workweek from 40 hours to 35. What an experiment!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Uncertainty</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/10/24/uncertainty</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world is full of uncertainty; my world is full of uncertainty. I have an unspecified amount of time to do an unspecified task. Shall I rest on my laurels and wait, or actively seek a goal?
The answer to that question is obvious, but then another world of uncertainty opens before me. A goal, yes. What should it be? How long shall I spend seeking it? Shall it relate purely to self-improvement, or shall it have nothing to do with self-improvement?<!--more--></p>
<p>OK, self-improvement. What path? Computers are interesting machines. Math is also cool. Looks like I may pursue those. Scott H Young did a year-long study called "The MIT Challenge", where he spent a year doing the full course work for a four-year technical degree from MIT.</p>
<p>I don't know what to make of myself. I am newly unemployed, so all my creative pursuits are now unfocused.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>

      <title>Tiny Habits take 2</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/07/27/tiny-habits-take-2</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dr. BJ Fogg runs <a href="http://tinyhabits.com/">Tiny Habits</a>, a one-week course on building new habits.
Since most of what we do is governed by habits, it is reasonable to study how to build new ones, or replace bad ones.</p>
<p>I <a href="/blog/2013/01/21/tiny-habits" title="Tiny Habits">have done his course before</a>, and had success. I have been reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Free-Spending-Your-Money-Matters/dp/0830836497">Free </a>with Kristi and some good friends of ours, and want to work more small but substantive things into my life. I am starting small, with the recommended item of flossing being Tiny Habit #1. I want to learn the methodology before trying too many habits of my own.</p>
<p>Habit #2 is "Mindful Breathing", a la Google Employee Chade Meng Tan's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Search-Inside-Yourself-Unexpected-Achieving/dp/0062116924">Search Inside Yourself</a>. He writes about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_intelligence">Emotional Intelligence</a>. Worth the read.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Josh, this is so encouraging to read. I have heard the other side that says you should shake things up a bit and get out of your routines, because when you have to do things INTENTIONALLY instead of from habit, your brain has to work harder, and it keeps your brain engaged and active and protected from disuse and eventual dementia. I prefer your approach!  I love you!  CAY</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>Maybe "Now" Is Not the Right Time</title>
      <link>/blog/2015/7/19/maybe-now-is-not-the-right-time</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently I deleted a bunch of old notes I had in <a target="_blank" href="https://evernote.com">Evernote</a>. Some of the notes were almost immediately unneeded,&nbsp;like old receipts and confirmations.&nbsp;</p><p>Much of the rest was notes related to goals ("Checklist to move out of MD Apartment", "Planning trip to Buenos Aires") or to projects I had. ("Set up personal website", "Outline book on overcoming fear of lead climbing", etc).&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the things I've been working on in the last few weeks I've been thinking about for over a year. Whoa. Why did I wait until now to do something that I'd obviously wanted to do over a year ago?</p><h2>"Now" is a good time to do something, but "later" isn't always bad.&nbsp;</h2><p dir="ltr">I've tried to find a different way of saying this, but anything else isn't honest. I've felt tremendous guilt lately at not accomplishing some of the projects I've laid out for myself.</p><ul dir="ltr"><li>I've not studied any Spanish, even though I've been living in Buenos Aires, fumbling around with my terrible Spanish skills.</li><li>I've not taken measurable steps on either of two side projects I've been meaning to accomplish (and have been wanting to do them for years.)</li><li>I've spent time reading mostly pointless fiction rather than more meaty non-fiction/histories/biographies, even though I'd much rather spend time in the latter.</li><li>I've only in the last few days feel like I've made significant progress with projects at work.&nbsp;</li><li>I've not done a single physically challenging act in two months. No climbing, no exercise.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>All of these things will be accomplished in time. While I shouldn't sit around until I magically feel motivated to do all of the undone things in my life, I can respect the ebb and flow of motivation, and peg the right projects to the right time.&nbsp;</p><p>I do this at a daily and weekly level (I.E. certain kinds of work when I'm feeling high/low energy, and I keep work limited to mostly-normal working hours), so it is no stretch to extend the principle to a monthly/yearly schedule. (Except for the exercise bit - I feel way better with exercise in my life, and allowed the current inaccessibility of climbing to derail that habit.)</p><p>It's hard for me to not succumb to the Instagram/Hacker News effect. (I just made that up. It's the endless viewing of other people's beautiful lives/successful products makes me think that I am a dismal failure, just because I'm not currently launching something elegent/successful/lucrative/world-changing or having a fabulous time in a beautiful place.)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How does this matter to you? </strong></p><p>The same way that it matters to me. Do things that matter. But don't lose sleep over not doing everything as quickly as you originally thought you might, and don't be beholden to doing things that you no longer need to do.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://josh.works/blog/2015/6/25/a-little-bit-of-slope-makes-up-for-a-lot-of-y-intercept">It's the slope, not the Y-intercept.&nbsp;</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Thoughts on Money from 2013</title>
      <link>/blog/thoughts-on-money-from-2013</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was looking through some draft posts I have lying around, and found one from the middle of 2013. That's 2.5 years ago. Reading over it, I feel satisfaction for a few reasons:</p><ol><li>Old Josh (from July 2013) wasn't a train wreck. As soon as I think about myself in highschool and college, I usually cringe thinking about the way I acted/thought. I don't feel complete shame thinking about 2013 Josh.</li><li>The goals I had in 2013 have pretty much all happened. We didn't have much knowledge over our finances then, but we do now. (I discovered <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youneedabudget.com/learn/guide/learn-to-prioritize">YNAB</a>, which completely transformed our relationship with our money)</li><li>This affirms my suspicion that <em>lots of small steps taken over a long time can make good things happen</em>.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>I've been reading and thinking a lot about money over the last two years. I'll compile a recommended reading list here soon, but the cool thing is this: I <em>enjoy </em>managing our finances. I'm no longer embarrassed or shamed by them.&nbsp;</p><p>And if we got to that place in 2.5 years, I think most people can. Here's what I wrote then:</p><h2 class="text-align-center">Josh's thoughts on finances <em>circa</em> July 2013</h2><p>[<strong>2016 Josh notes</strong>: I’ve included commentary in-line with what I wrote then. &nbsp;It is all called out like this.]</p><p>I write this July 27th, 2013, and I don't know when I will publish it. <strong>[2016 Josh notes</strong>: Perhaps in January, 2016]</p><p>Currently, I have no plans of publishing this within six months, but eventually I hope this post meets the internet. Money scares me. Having it is scary, but losing it is even worse. Kristi and I have been married for 13 months, and we have alternated between me being the sole income-earner (on less than $30,000 a year, in one of the most expensive cities in America) to us <em>both</em>&nbsp;working (she's a kindergarten teacher in PG county - not lucrative, but way more money than zero dollars) to <em>Kristi</em>&nbsp;being the sole income-earner (I got fired).&nbsp;[<strong>2016 Josh notes</strong>: I could write extensively about being fired, but right now I'll summarize it as <em>the best work-thing that has ever happened to me</em>. It was an opportunity for enormous growth.]</p><p>I was able to get unemployment (through the business, not the government) but it was still stressful. It was almost six months before I got another full-time job, earning about $34,000 a year.)</p><p>Then, we both were working, and it was great! I could know exactly how much was deposited in our bank account every two weeks. Our lifestyle inflated, and we found ourselves spending more. Or, rather,&nbsp;<em>I </em>found us spending more. I'm in charge of managing our finances, and sometimes it sucks.&nbsp;[<strong>2016 Josh notes</strong>: It sucked because I did not know how much we spent, and was not able to know if we were generally improving our financial position, treading water, or losing ground.]</p><p>During the summer, Kristi's not receiving a paycheck, so we're temporarily back down to one income. But we're used to spending like we had two incomes. A few large expenses have come through (a few plane tickets, an <em>awesome</em>&nbsp;family vacation with 15 extended family members, but it was a half-block from Rehoboth Beach, and cost what you would expect - a lot)</p><p>So, right now, I've dipped into our savings to cover our expenses. There's nothing wrong here - we knew she was not going to be earning money over the summer. [<strong>2016 Josh notes</strong>: Partial lie. We <em>thought </em>she was going to be paid over the summer, but turns out PGCO bobbled the paperwork. We "knew" this when her paychecks stopped in April.]&nbsp;</p><p>I still have this inexplicable sense of discomfort, because I don't know some pretty basic details of our own spending. I'm embarrassed even as I write this. Income in per month (easy to know) compared to spending per month - also fairly easy, but the afore-mentioned big-ticket items have drastically skewed our "average spending". [<strong>2016 Josh notes</strong>: We knew our expenses <em>retroactively</em>, I.E I could look at a credit card statement, but we never had <em>planned</em>&nbsp;our expenses, or managed our spending based on goals or expenses. Yikes.]</p><p>I'm looking forward to living on just one income, and saving half of our take-home. This is a huge milestone. The steps, as they look right now, are these:</p><ol><li>Identify current income/expense ratio</li><li>Identify low-hanging fruit to reduce expenses</li><li>Reduce said expenses</li><li>Repeat step two, until we're unwilling to further reduce expenses</li><li>Boost income without inflating lifestyle, so all extra income can go into savings.</li></ol><p>And, well, that's my plan.</p><p>[<strong>2016 Josh notes:</strong> For the most part, we've done all this. A significant portion of our income goes into savings, and I know our income/expense ratio, and can PLAN our spending well in advance. We've boosted our income but reduced our lifestyle from 2013 levels, so more money goes into savings/investments.]</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>"Cooking" is so much more</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/07/12/cooking-is-so-much-more</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've long wanted to get better at cooking. I eat a lot of food, and would like to enjoy it. I've gotten to a point where I am comfortable following a recipe, and I bet you normally are fine following a recipe too.
To follow a recipe, you must have two things. These two things have always surprised me in their difficulty.</p>
<ol>
<li>Decide what recipe to follow</li>
<li>Have the proper ingredients on hand</li>
</ol>
<p>There's a lot of planning that goes into eating. I don't love running to the grocery store. We go once a week. This means we have to plan out what meals we will eat, in advance. If I want to eat better, <em>and </em>cook outside my comfort zone, this means we have to figure out what meals we want to eat, which hopefully uses the items we have on hand. For example, if a meal requires a tablespoon of molasses, and you don't have any, you need a whole jar of molasses. BUT! Once you have that jar, you can use it in many meals before going to the store again.</p>
<p>This grows complex when you have a bunch of partially used ingredients lying around. I'm still trying to figure out what a "core" list of ingredients and supplies we need. It's this list of background knowledge that will make cooking easier. Right now, when I see a list of fifteen required ingredients, I barely know if we have any on hand, or if we don't, if we have any substitutions. This means fifteen ingredients presents fifteen little puzzles.</p>
<p>With time, and skill, fifteen ingredients will present only two or three unfamiliar ingredients, and picking recipes will be easy. Then, grocery shopping won't be so stressful.</p>
<p>In summary - if you want to be a better cook, know your pantry better.</p>

      <title>Five Lessons Learned in Buenos Aires</title>
      <link>/blog/five-lessons-learned-in-buenos-aires</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: This is an unedited draft of a post from July 5, 2015. Almost exactly one year ago, written after a week in Buenos Aires. Since writing this post, Kristi and I have continued on to more than a year of non-stop travel, though we're settling down back in Golden, CO in about two months.&nbsp;</em><br /><br />Kristi and I arrived here in Buenos Aires less than a week ago. We've quickly found a routine in some ways, and in others, are still very out of our routine.</p><ol><li><strong>No matter where you go, you are still you.</strong> If you want to escape from all your insecurities, disappointments, and challenges, you have to figure out how to not take yourself along.&nbsp;<br /> </li><li><strong>Being outside of your comfort zone grows you.&nbsp;</strong> If you want to escape from all your insecurities, disappointments, and challenges, doing hard things may help turn you into someone who is less insecure, less disappointed, and not as challenged by things that were once challenging.&nbsp;<br /><br />In many ways we feel like children here. We struggle to communicate, don't recognize much, and don't know where things are. In an absolute sense, our accomplishments are small (I.E. we've managed to feed ourselves) and our need is large (We're staying in a grandparent's empty apartment, many people here in Buenos Aires have gone out of their way to help us in small and large ways).&nbsp;<br /> </li><li><strong>Perspective matters</strong>.&nbsp;The first time I walked back from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.areatresworkplace.com/ubicaciones.html#soho">coworking space</a> to our apartment without wondering if I took a wrong turn, I felt a sense of accomplishment. It's been so long since I've felt a sense of accomplishment for such a mundane thing. I am rediscovering the joys succeeding in very boring ways every day. (Exchanged pleasantries and asked questions to a fruit vendor? WIN! Found lunch, paid for it? WIN!)<br /> </li><li><strong>Doing hard stuff with a friend is better than doing it alone.&nbsp;</strong> Kristi is my best friend. Lots of people travel to other countries by themselves. It's 1000% better doing it with your best friend. (And being married to your best friend? Whoa.) I spent a semester abroad in college, and often felt quite discouraged. I've not felt discouraged at all here, and it's because of Kristi.&nbsp;<br /><br />For example, after butchering my way through a conversation with a taxi driver in terrible, broken Spanish, I was frustrated at how bad I was at it. I was thinking of all the reasons I <strong>should</strong>&nbsp;be better at Spanish. I was thinking of all the people I know who are fluent in both English and Spanish, and how dumb I am compared to them.<br /><br />Kristi just said "Good job. You did great."&nbsp;<br /><br />And I was at peace again.<br /> </li><li><strong>An unstable currency is a disaster. </strong>The Argentinian Peso is inflating very, very quickly. There are government controls on bringing money into the country. The official exchange rate is about 25% less than the real exchange rate. This causes great harm to everyone on the peso (except, I suppose, the government who doesn't have to pay debts yet). Everyone inside and outside of Argentina knows the economy is a disaster. But they got there via one small public policy at a time.&nbsp;</li></ol>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Three Ways to Decide What to be When You Grow Up</title>
      <link>/blog/three-ways-to-decide-what-to-be-when-you-grow-up</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I have had to explain to people what is it that I want to do. This question is difficult to answer for two reasons. The first reason is I am not yet strongly pulled into a specific position. My ideal answer would be "I want to do X role at company Y."
Short. Concise. Memorable.</p>
<p>So far, I do not have that answer.</p>
<p>These are the things I am doing to get that answer:</p>
<p><strong>1. Learn about areas of interest by reading books.<!--more--></strong>
Commit to reading one book every two weeks. Familiarize yourself with your local library, and browse until you find something that looks interesting. Follow the rabbit hole by flagging (mentally or on paper) interesting topics or references in that book as you read.</p>
<p>Once you have finished that book, go find books related to the interesting topics you already noted. Keep this up, and you should soon have a body of knowledge related to ideas interesting to you. You improve in other ways by learning a little self-discipline and you learn to<i> </i>read with a purpose. I've recently been picking books from<a href="http://www.sparringmind.com/psychology-books/"> this list</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2. Spend money on information interviews.</strong></p>
<p>Do you know an interesting person, or someone who seems to do interesting work? Invite them out for coffee. This meeting is not a place to beg for a job, or prove to them how smart you are. It is an <a href="http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/whats-an-information-interview-and-why-arent-you-doing-it/">informational interview</a>, and <em>you</em> are interviewing <em>them</em>.</p>
<p>To you, this person is a VIP (Very Important Person) and you should treat them with respect and care. Reach out to them via email and invite them out to coffee at a time and place convenient to them. You're paying, of course, because you value getting to hear more about them, what they do, and why they do what they do.</p>
<p>Most people enjoy talking about themselves (I know I do) and if they are indeed interested in the work they do, they may enjoy sharing about that as well. Use informational interviews to learn relevant information that you could not gain in any other way.</p>
<p><strong>3. Learn to market yourself.</strong></p>
<p>Do you have skills? Presumably you do; at a minimum you can use a computer, and are literate. That won't get you very far, unfortunately, so you need to either gain new skills, or discover skills you already have. <a href="http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2007/05/31/be-yourself-law-of-attraction-and-other-pieces-of-bad-advice/">"Being yourself" is not good enough.</a></p>
<p>Discover skills you already have:</p>
<p>Think long and hard about things that you have done, and how those things could mesh with needs someone else has. Your resume should not be a list of cool things you have done, but a list of ways you meet needs and add value to your little corner of the world. Read the first item of<a href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-harsh-truths-that-will-make-you-better-person/"> this Cracked.com article</a> for an explanation.</p>
<p>There are many examples of skills you have, and may not even know it. Can you walk dogs? Someone out there needs a dog walker. How about babysitting? Does someone needs a good receptionist? Maybe you're quite friendly and good at answering phones. Receptionists that work in classy businesses make good money. If a client walking in the door represents a contract worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, or millions of dollars, that company will pay top dollar to make sure the first person that client sees is professional, attentive, and sympathetic.</p>
<p>Gain new skills:</p>
<p>Take some classes at Udacity.com. Learn a little about marketing, business management, data analysis, financial planning, software design, computer-user interface, or whatever else tickles your fancy. Draw connections between topics that others do not. Watch your world grow.</p>
<p><strong>I want to do X at company Y.</strong></p>
<p>None of these items listed above will give you that answer, but they will make set you down a path of learning to move you in that direction. When you do find a direction to go, you'll be more qualified to do whatever it is you want to do.</p>

      <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px">Recently, I have had to explain to people what is it that I want to do. This question is difficult to answer for two reasons. The first reason is I am not yet strongly pulled into a specific position. My ideal answer would be "I want to do X role at company Y." Short. Concise. Memorable.</p><p>So far, I do not have that answer.</p><p>These are the things I am doing to get that answer:</p><p>1. Learn about areas of interest by reading books.&nbsp;Commit to reading one book every two weeks. Familiarize yourself with your local library, and browse until you find something that looks interesting. Follow the rabbit hole by flagging (mentally or on paper) interesting topics or references in that book as you read.</p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

<p>I love learning, business, climbing, my wife, books, food, and doing hard things. Cognitive psychology has a lot to offer, as does an attitude of humility. Most of what I write will touch one one of these things.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>But when we do, we watch <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ninja_Warrior">American Ninja Warrior</a>.
It's great fun. The obstacles take a mix of strength and skill, and every one is pretty good-natured.</p>
<p>It seems that often some of the best contestants are also rock climbers. Many come into it from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour">Parkour</a> background, but they get fatigued and fall, or, have bad technique, get fatigued, and fall.</p>
<p>The courses look doable. I know some extremely strong climbers who have tried to get on the show. I'm not sure why they've not gotten on the show. It's a fun goal to think about. Maybe one of these upcoming days, I'll make it to the show. We shall see.</p>

      <title>How I Became A Consultant</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/10/10/how-to-become-a-consultant</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, I became a real-life business consultant.
I've been taking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krav_Maga">Krav Maga</a> lessons from <a href="http://www.kravmagadc.com/www/index.php?p=home">Krav Maga DC</a>, in Chinatown. A few months in the owner sent out an email saying he was looking for help managing KMDC's Facebook and Twitter accounts.</p>
<p>I set up a meeting to discuss this request.</p>
<p><strong>Laying the groundwork
</strong></p>
<p>I was (very) nervous going in and meeting him. I've never consulted before, and I was positive it was obvious. (Maybe it was?) and had no idea what sort of arrangement we would come up with. (We ended up giving me a free membership for as long as I'm working with him, but more on that later.) I was half ready for him to stand up, flip the table, and tell me to get out of his sight and never come back.</p>
<p>Thanks to the awesome content put out by <a href="http://brennandunn.com/">Brennan Dunn</a> and <a href="http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/">Ramit Sethi</a> (I highly suggest signing up for both newsletter) I knew to pay attention not just to his explicit problems (using FB and Twitter) but to the underlying needs and concerns.</p>
<p><i>He had asked for help with marketing, but that's not what he </i>really<em> wants help for.</em> Business owners are looking to generate more revenue. So are you, and  I, in fact. We all want to generate more revenue.</p>
<p>I prepped with a few different ways his business needs could line up with my skills. He wants a new website, but I'm not ready to take on project like that. I told him I could help him and his staff get up to speed on their Facebook page and Twitter account, but that wasn't where real solutions lay.</p>
<p>I explained that the metric by which I would evaluate success would be how many new members he gets per month. This is a pretty solid number, because it correlates well with business growth. If he normally gets ten new members a month, and I can help him get to twenty, that doesn't just double his income, it doubles his growth. (<a href="http://xkcd.com/605/">But let's not go too overboard with projections...</a>)</p>
<p><b>What I offered</b></p>
<p>I offered a product, or a service (I guess I'm freelancing, rather than consulting. A consultant provides opinions, a freelancer provides a product or service.)</p>
<p>I am providing a two-part service:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>I am soliciting positive feedback to be used in marketing materials</em>. As a "third party" to the business-customer relationship, I can ask in a way that he could not. More importantly, however, he does not have to deal with this himself.</li>
<li><em>I am packaging the positive </em>and<em> the negative feedback into useable, implementable suggestions ranked on ease of implementation and size of impact.</em> This is a big deal because we're not just getting customers to talk about KMDC, but KMDC has a chance to implement their suggestions!</li>
</ol>
<p>These two services compose <b>product</b> that I believe scales to a large number of small businesses. Any business with a customer base dependent upon repeat business stands to benefit by figuring out how to better provide value to their customers, and better communicate that value added to potential customers.</p>
<p>I'm counting this work as building my portfolio. I'm doing it for him on a month-by-month basis in exchange for comping me my membership. So I'm not getting paid, but I'm not paying for an otherwise-expensive gym membership.</p>
<p><b>The end goal</b></p>
<p><em>If he doesn't take the suggestions, or at least experiment with them a little, it will appear as if I've added no value. This would feel like a failure on my behalf. </em></p>
<p>I will be more confident if I can define success in such a way that I can achieve it even if he does not make the changes, yet I struggle with this daily.</p>
<p>I must define success as having tried, and learned things about what does and does not work. Yet I still feel like I'll be devastated if this doesn't pan out exactly how I want it to.</p>
<p><b>Solve problems. There's always a market for solving problems.</b></p>
<p>I started consulting. Just like that. If I can do it, you can. And here's why: <i>I focused on solving his problems.</i></p>
<p>"But Josh" you say, "I can't solve another businesses problems."</p>
<p>That's a great point. You can't. (Does the business suffer from excessive database maintenance costs because it's built on an outdated and unsupported framework? If you majored in English Lit or Political Science and have not become best friends with <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, you're right. You can't solve that businesses problem.)</p>
<p>If you can identify pain points for you when interacting with a business, and can imagine a possible solution, you've got most of what you need to start consulting. All you need now is to convince the business owner that you can help them. If I had the secret sauce for how do do this, I'd give it to you. I promise.</p>
<p>Here's one tidbit: Businesses revolve around delivering joy and happiness to their users. No longer is there a monopoly for services - customers want to be delighted. Help businesses delight customers and you'll die a rich and satisfied person. Maybe.</p>
<p><b>Your turn. Become a problem solver.</b>
Anytime you're not satisfied with a business interaction, figure out how that business could solve that issue. If you can package this solution in a way that is a win for you and them, you are in a good position.</p>
<p>Practice your pitch. Set up a meeting. Pitch.</p>
<p>If it crashes and burns, congratulations - you've made your first big win. It's OK to fail. If you can accept regular failure, you're bulletproof (er -<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Gain-Disorder/dp/1400067820"> Anti-Fragile</a>) and you're ready to do it again.</p>
<p>Keep throwing stuff against the wall and see what sticks.</p>
<p>PS: If this is useful to you, share it with others. Give me feedback - I love to talk about these things.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Looking at their site, they need to step it up and you can probably help them.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

Interesting ideas. My goal right now is along the lines of "rapid validation", I.E. is there a real business model here that someone may be interested in.</p>
<p>The way Buffer did it here (http://bit.ly/1hFr6Cy) is inspiring, and that's what I'm learning towards. Once I get it (or something) up and running, it will be time for a much more in-depth analysis. </p>
<p>I'll keep your expertise in mind!</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Jeff! Thanks for the information. I'm checking out SquareSpace right now, for a project of my own. 
I didn't want to sell services on a product I'd never thoroughly used. Another friend had suggested both SquareSpace and Weebly - Both look great, but since I wasn't sure of their capabilities, I didn't want to start spec'ing out a website on it. </p>
<p>Although… this may have just been another form of fear of failure. Once I get my stuff set up on a website (I just bought the domain!) I'll probably start offering basic web services. The $250/year is pretty minimal, if it's providing any real value.  </p>
<p>You still climbing a lot? If so… I may make a request of you. Details to follow...</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>Use an Alarm to Go to Bed</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/07/08/use-an-alarm-to-go-to-bed</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ironically, this is about going to bed early. See, it's 10:40p, and I'm getting up tomorrow at 6:00. So I'm looking at about 7 hours of sleep. This is perfect. But, that is only if I'm asleep in the next twenty minutes.
I know how long it takes to get ready to leave in the morning. If I want bacon and eggs, a shower, and coffee, I need a little over thirty minutes, but its rushed. An hour is better, and relaxing.</p>
<p>But I don't know how long it takes to get ready for bed. If I plan to wake up early, I need to get to bed at the right time. If I set a bed time, I need a "start getting ready for bed" time. And THAT magic time currently escapes me. But if I set a time to wake up in the morning, I should set a time to go to sleep, as well.</p>
<p>If you can track it, you can change it. I've got the means to record this information - all that is left is for me to use it. Isn't this true in so many areas of life? We have the tools to accomplish incredible things at our finger tips, yet we use none of them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Josh, I LOVE your writing style. I was bragging to Dad about it, and YOU, the other day, telling him how it is so "SO what, who cares," (Remember that phrase of Dad's- that he was always looking for application) and there is always a catchy summary at the end. It just dawned on me- you saw the "so what-who cares" importance modeled by Dad, and you saw the "catchy summary at the end" in the Growing Up book I wrote. There was always a reason for my writing the particular stories I wrote in that book, and that last sentence explains it! You are such a unique combination of the lessons Dad and I taught you, and also of so many you have learned (taught yourself) as well!
You amaze me!  </p>
<p>I love you!  </p>

      <title>Illdefined Success is Unattainable</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/07/08/illdefined-success-is-unattainable</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all probably have a few projects floating around our head, but they seem daunting.
If it doesn't seem daunting, it's not much of a project, and you should either ramp it up until it's daunting, or discard it.</p>
<p>So - we have a daunting project. Now what? If you're like me, you'll fart around on the internet for a little while, doing "research". You may take a few, or even many, steps in a certain direction. You'll possibly feel good about it for a little while.</p>
<p>But when the enthusiasm fades, you stop the work.</p>
<p>There are many reasons to stop work on a project. Some of them are good ones. It seems like a waste of time doing work on something you don't want to do! But if you do want to do it, and can't, what's going on?</p>
<p>I submit this: Without a clear definition of success, it is <em>impossible</em> to actually succeed.</p>
<p>Half the battle is defining success. So, step one of a project should be: Define success.</p>

      <title>A Five-Hour Experiment</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/07/09/a-five-hour-experiment</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://joshkaufman.net/">Josh Kaufman</a> wrote an excellent book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591845556/"><em>The First 20 Hours</em></a>.
In it, he carefully plots out a handful of experiments to acquire a reasonable amount of skill in a new thing in twenty hours.</p>
<p>He studied yoga, windsurfing, programming, <a href="http://colemak.com/">Colemak</a> typing, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28game%29">a form of Chinese chess called Go</a>, and the ukulele. He spent just twenty hours on each of these subjects, and got to a reasonable level of proficiency.</p>
<p>I was inspired to try this method, and attempted to learn to type in <a href="http://colemak.com/">Colemak</a>. (It's an alternative keyboard layout). I got in a few hours of practice, got my words-per-minute to just above ten (yes. Ten words per minute) and then got distracted and gave up.</p>
<p>So - I'm going to try again, but I'm going to see how much I can accomplish in five hours of practice. These hours will certainly not be consecutive. I will practice in short intervals spread over a few days, and I'll report back my practice.</p>
<p>Before I start I'll define success, very carefully. More on that later. One of my metrics of success will be to write a 100-word post using Colemac in less than five minutes. Phew.</p>

      <title>The Next Twelve Months Matter</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/10/25/why-this-next-year-is-so-important</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The end of November is a strange time to consider the next year of life. I should be doing this on my birthday, or late December, right?
Wrong. I have joined the ranks of the unemployed, and I think this is a grand opportunity. This next year is so important because <i>I must not waste this opportunity</i>! If I blindly pursue having a job for the sake of having a job, I fail to maximize my opportunity. If I lament, whine, and complain about not having a job, I fail to maximize this opportunity.<!--more--></p>
<p>This next year is formative in many respects. I will lay down important financial foundations, make career decisions, and learn to better love my wife. The question is not "Will I lay down foundations and build habits" but "what sort of foundations and habits will I create?"</p>
<p>What sort of habits have you built in the last month, and what would you like to change next month?</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>First five meals from The 4-Hour Chef</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/07/08/first-five-meals-from-the-4-hour-chef</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don't know how to cook. Period. My most impressive culinary creations were, until recently, spaghetti and beans-n-rice.
I got married about a year ago, and had hoped that I would become inspired to become a world-class chef. After a long time eating Rice-A-Roni, spaghetti, sloppy joes, burgers, and anything that can be prepared in a crock pot, I was looking for a change, and <a href="/epic-quest" title="My Epic Quest of Awesome">this has been a priority for a while.</a><!--more--></p>
<p>Enter Tim Ferriss's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-4-Hour-Chef-Learning-Anything/dp/0547884591/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358001534&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+four+hour+chef">The 4-Hour Chef.</a> Among many other things in the book, he has a prescribed set of recipes to follow. In each recipe, he builds on skills, tools, and ingredients used in the prior recipe. His aim with each meal is maximum impact in taste and appearance, but minimum effort and cleanup. This resonates with me, because he speaks in terms of <em>Return on Investment</em> (in terms of money, time, and effort.)</p>
<p>Most importantly, once you have the book, you don't need any other resources. You'll need some basic tools, but he spells out all the processes the first time he introduces them.</p>
<h4>I will record my trip through his book, and identify any hiccups along the way. I hope, in addition to cataloging my own successes and failures, I can inspire one or two of <em>you</em> to give this a shot.</h4>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Lesson One: Osso Buko</strong></p>
<p>The first lesson is braised lamb. What is a <em>braised</em> anything?</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braising">Braising </a>is a combination cooking method using both moist and dry heat; typically the food is first seared at a high temperature and then finished in a covered pot with a variable amount of liquid, resulting in a particular flavor.</p></blockquote>
<p>For this lesson, we (Tim and I, of course.) skipped the searing. It's easier this way, and still comes out great.</p>
<p>There are two critical ingredients to Osso Buko. First, the meat. I was supposed to have lamb shanks. Where the heck do you get lamb shanks? I went to a local Giant and poked around their meat department for a while, and could find nothing that looked like what Tim had in his book.</p>

<p>Since I was cooking for three later that evening, I just grabbed meat that said "lamb" on it, and also had visible bone. Turns out I had gotten lamb chops. Oh well.</p>
<p><em>I had my meat.</em> What was the other critical ingredient? Not an ingredient, per se, but a tool. I had to use a cast-iron dutch oven. I've never owned anything cast iron, and there was no cast iron cook wear in my house growing up. My uncle introduced me to it when I lived in his basement after I finished college; he is an excellent cook, and he swears by the stuff. Since he is a trustworthy source, I did not protest much to the idea of getting a cast iron dutch oven. Especially since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lodge-Logic-Pre-Seasoned-Combo-Cooker/dp/B0009JKG9M/ref=sr_1_1?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358005155&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=dutch+oven+combo">this dutch oven by Lodge</a> is both a pot and a skillet.</p>
<p><a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe53e4b0278244ce9fff/1434910433374/pic-01142013-004.jpg"><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe53e4b0278244ce9fff/1434910433374/pic-01142013-004.jpg" alt="About to be cooked." class="size-medium wp-image-908 " /></a></p>
<p>Now that I had my meat and my pot, I put everything in the pot (carrots, lamb, canned whole tomatoes, a little garlic, extra-virgin olive oil, and some white wine) and I stuck it in the oven for two hours. It came out delicious, and tender. Everything was edible, including the carrots and the tomatoes.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em>Lessons learned:</em> While meals may be simple, it can be a real pain finding the correct ingredients. The chops I got were not at all what I was looking for, but it was the only lamb I could find. If you know where to get good lamb shanks, let me know.</p>
<p><a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe54e4b0278244cea01f/1434910433999/pic-01142013-011.jpg"><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe54e4b0278244cea01f/1434910433999/pic-01142013-011.jpg" alt="I substituted lamb shanks with turkey legs. It was OK. " class="size-medium wp-image-913 " /></a></p>
<p>I eventually ended up getting turkey thighs instead of lamb shanks, just so I could have a better idea of how it is supposed to go. It worked out, but I'm not a huge turkey fan, so... I'm going to keep looking for lamb shanks.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Lesson One and a Half: Chuck Roast</strong></p>
<p>The very next page, after the Ossu Buko, was a variation of braising using just a chuck roast, and three different cans of broth. Put everything together in the pot, and bake for 2.5 hours. Seriously. That easy. It was delicious. And there was <em>lots</em> of left overs.</p>
<p><a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe55e4b0278244cea052/1434910435306/pic-05112013-002.jpg"><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe55e4b0278244cea052/1434910435306/pic-05112013-002.jpg" alt="Breakfast of champions." class="size-medium wp-image-918" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Lesson Two: Scrambled Eggs</strong></p>
<p>I've been eating three eggs and bacon for breakfast every day for at least two years. Repetitive, yes, but healthy (in some circles. Unhealthy in others. Guess which camp I am in?) and easy. I don't scramble them, I just put 'em sunny side up and mop the yolks with the bacon.</p>
<p>It was easy to transfer to scrambled eggs. Tim outlines three different ways to make scrambled eggs, and they all three have to do with the ratio of egg whites to egg yolks. He recommends a 2:1 ratio of yolks to whites. This would leave me with a ton of whites, so I've been using a 1:1. (In his defense, he has a paragraph labeled "What the hell do I do with these extra egg whites?" The answer is either flip the ratio next time around, make crab cakes, or hair conditioner. Yes, hair conditioner...)</p>
<p>I'm stuck in the rut of sunny-side up eggs and bacon, though, so after a few days of playing around with scrambled eggs, I settled back into my old habits.</p>
<p>Tim lists <em>around the world in 44 flavor combinations </em>as suggestions to get a feel for different cuisines  With just a few basic spices, you can get from Mexico to India to the Middle East to Greece to Hungary and more.</p>
<p>I experimented with scrambled eggs for a few days, but I just love my sunny-side-up eggs cooked in a little bacon grease. It's quick and easy, and oh-so-filling.</p>
<p>(My last trip to Giant, they had eggs for the cheap. I bought four-and-a-half DOZEN eggs. It lasted about three weeks. Mm, protein.)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Lesson Three: Coconut Cauliflower Curry Mash</strong></p>
<p>This was my first total failure. I screwed up the ingredient ratios, and found out I didn't have curry (I thought I did) so I unintentionally steamed a bunch of cauliflower that was too hard to mash, yet still soft enough to eat plain; I had cauliflower leftovers for a few days. The upside is cauliflower steamed with coconut milk is delicious, even if it can't be mashed up like mashed potatoes. For "total failure", it was no big loss.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Lesson Four: Union Square Zucchini</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe54e4b0278244cea038/1434910434726/pic-02032013-002.jpg"><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe54e4b0278244cea038/1434910434726/pic-02032013-002.jpg" alt="Very tasty. Highly recommended." class="size-medium wp-image-914 " /></a></p>
<p>This stuff was delicious!</p>
<p>My biggest challenge for this lesson was finding zucchini! The two local Giants that I visited didn't have 'em. Once I found out that zucchini is basically a squash, I had better luck finding it. (Cucumbers, on the other hand, are not interchangeable!) I also did not have the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghee">Ghee</a> (clarified butter) or chilli pepper. I used red pepper flakes, instead, and some regular butter.</p>
<p>I peeled the outside of the zucchini before slicing it into thin strips- turns out I didn't have to do it. Skipping that step will save time, and the peeler I was using wasn't working so well; I got a better peeler. Between not peeling the outside, and having a good peeler, the prep took about 1/3 as long.</p>
<p><em>Lessons learned:</em> Zucchini are also called squash. After scouring the world looking for some stinking zucchini, I realized I had found it. Several times. And never even knew it. Again, shopping has proven to be the biggest frustration. The good news is, one can get better at shopping for food. Everything else is easy. This was seriously delicious.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Lesson Five: Bittman Chinese Chicken with Bok Choy</strong></p>
<p>I could not find the necessary baby <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_cabbage">bok choy</a>, so this was actually just Chinese chicken. I had never steamed meat before, but it's pretty easy. I started with boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut them in half the long way, and lay them on top of a wire rack above steaming water. Put a lid on top, and pull them off fifteen minutes later.</p>
<p>This is easy, in theory, except I didn't have a wire rack (I commandeered the wire rack from my toaster oven), and I didn't know when to start the fifteen minute timer. I decided that the water should be boiling before you put the chicken on top of the wire rack, and <em>that</em> is when you start the fifteen minutes.</p>
<p><em>Take two:</em></p>
<p><em></em>I was able to get the Bok Choy, and made the sauce more than 20 minutes in advance. It still tasted very good, and it presents very well. (If you want to look like a kick-butt chef, talk about "presenting". It distracts the guests from the<em> taste</em> of the food, and focuses the attention on the <em>look</em> of the food. This can be a good thing.)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Lessons I learned</strong></p>
<p>This post represents many, many hours of work. Between reading and trying to figure out what I needed to do and buy, to actually trying to buy the stuff, to cooking and cleaning, a lot of work happened here. But it was worth it. I'm learning my way around a kitchen.</p>
<p>Since eating is a pretty regular part of my life, it is worth it to me to get good at it.</p>
<p><em>Even when everything seems perfectly clear, there is still plenty of room for questions</em>. Most questions related to ingredient substitution; I don't have curry powder, so I'll try red pepper flakes. No ghee? I'll go without.</p>
<p><em>I questioned plenty of the cooking processes. </em>Fifteen minutes of cooking over boiling water. Should the water be boiling when I put the meat on, or do I count heating the water as part of the fifteen minutes? (Thank you, probe thermometers...)</p>
<p><em>I had issues finding all the food that I needed for the meals.</em> I never shopped for more than one meal at a time, even though this meant lots of trips to the store. At the time, I had plenty of time to go to Giant, so my struggle with batching grocery runs was not overly problematic.</p>
<p><em>Fear of failure can be overpowering. </em>I didn't want to mess these up. It helped that my wife, Kristi, would often make a side, like mashed potatoes or microwaved corn. That took some of the pressure of failure off me. All the fear of failure was entirely self-generated. And <a href="http://www.tarathai.com/">Tara Thai</a> is right down the street. And they deliver. If it all <em>does</em> totally hit the fan, just order some take out. Consider it an inexpensive and very local cooking class, and you learned something that does not work. <a href="/blog/2013/07/10/crock-pots-are-foolproof-right" title="Crock Pots are Foolproof, Right?">Failure is not so bad.</a></p>
<p><em>Shopping is an important part of cooking</em>. I never expected shopping to be so hard. I now realize that I must mentally equip myself to go into the store and come out with what I need. There are thousands of choices, and it's painful walking the entire store looking for one stupid item that you <em>know</em> they have.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Ask at the butcher counter for lamb shanks, our store will cut them for you. Sounds like you are off to a fabulous start! Ghee is easier to make than to buy in my experience. Basically all you are doing is melting the butter enough to separate the solids from the fat. Here is a recipe--in case you need it for something else: http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/ghee-recipe/index.html
Also I think you would really enjoy "Good Eats" a cooking show by Alton Brown. He not only teaches the how, but delves into the science to show the why of various cooking techniques. You can stream some of his shows on Amazon Prime.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Thanks for the tips, Amanda. I was at wits end trying to find those dumb lamb shanks. I looked everywhere, and even the internet didn't help me as much as I had expected. I'll try asking at the counter next time. Although... I did call two butcher shops to see if they had them, and they said they didn't butcher lamb. But Giant has lamb. So... maybe Giant butchers whole lambs?
I don't really know how butchering works. I'd really like to learn. Maybe Giant will let me intern with them for a half-day, now and again. </p>
<p>I'll try making the Ghee, too. Supposedly it's very tasty. "Decadent" was the description I heard.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>I Once Worked Hard</title>
      <link>/blog/i-once-worked-hard</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I began working at my first job out of college, I knew I didn't want to spend my whole career there. I was a college graduate (that means something, right?) working at a climbing gym, part time, teaching seven-year-olds how to climb at about $10 an hour.</p><p>I had no idea what I wanted to do next. A few weeks in, the company began preparing the space next to ours for a HUGE expansion; this climbing gym was to become (over the next nine months) the largest climbing gym in the nation.</p><p>I got to play a role by asking the COO if I could help on the expansion. He gave me a task, and left for the day. I had about 90 minutes before the construction site needed to be empty and locked, so I figured I'd just do the whole task before it finished.</p><p>My task was ripping about forty five concrete bollards out of the ground and stacking them near the front of the warehouse. Each one weighed at least ninety pounds, and was sitting on a rebar post buried in the concrete. To get each one out I had to lever each one back and forth to loosen it, and then use a wedge of wood to lift the rebar out of the ground.</p><p>Imagine you have a really drunk friend standing in front of you, and if you shake him hard enough, he'll sober up. That was basically what I did, for all forty five. It was hard work, but I finished just as we had to lock up the space.</p><p>I later found that this was basically a test to see if I could finish a project without someone breathing down my neck. I passed.</p><p><strong>Working hard matters</strong></p><p>For the next nine months, I replicated this pattern over and over, sacrificing my time, rest, and at times my safety to complete the expansion. I considered my high level of dedication to the goal to be the skill that I could bring to the table. I wanted to perform well and use my skills, and my skills were manual labor and simple craftsmanship. I heard from many different people that I was the hardest worker they'd ever met, and I earned the respect of almost everyone I worked with.</p><p>I thought this was all good, and I aspired to reinforce all of these perceptions. I worked <em>extremely </em>long weeks, I could go weeks without taking any days off, and I thought this was good. I had hopes to move up in management when the opportunity arose, and I wanted to be the obvious choice.</p><p><em>The only thing I knew how to do was work hard.</em></p><p>I worked hard to satisfy the needs of construction, I worked hard to satisfy my other responsibilities, teaching classes, managing staff, and manning the desk. I would get to the gym and work construction from 6am to 6pm, then teach a class and close the gym at 11pm. Twelve hour days were nice, because they were shorter than most.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1458141340018_29703">A revolution in my thinking occurred after the expansion finished. I realized that just working hard may make me stand out, but it doesn't really matter. An entry-level programmer gets paid far more than a skilled and trustworthy janitor. The programmer builds things that did not exist, and solves problems that no one else has solved. I wanted to become more like a programmer, and less like a janitor.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1458141340018_29706"><strong>Working hard doesn't matter that much</strong></p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1458141340018_29710">I used to think of my job as something that I would do with excellence, and I did it with excellence. Over a few months, I started seeing my job (and its responsibilities) as a platform I could use to identify and then solve business problems. I started looking for processes that were cumbersome or annoying. I looked for ways the gym could offer a better product. I looked for ways I could help grow and develop our staff.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1458141340018_29713">The more I looked, the more I found. I was soon aware of dozens of problems, and I could think of potential solutions to many of them. I could, with only a little effort, be known as<em> the guy who identifies and solves problems.</em></p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1458141340018_29718">So I did.</p><ul id="yui_3_17_2_1_1458141340018_29721"><li>I changed the staff listserv, so the staff could use it without bothering those who did not want the emails. Traffic on the listserv blew up, while unwanted emails dropped to almost zero.</li></ul><ul id="yui_3_17_2_1_1458141340018_29725"><li>I designed and taught a new class to help lead climbers learn to belay with professionalism and confidence; that confidence and skill enables their climber to push themselves in a way they never thought possible. Not only were they safer climbers, they were instantly improved climbers, because they overcame significant psychological barriers.</li></ul><ul id="yui_3_17_2_1_1458141340018_29729"><li>The gym director spent a lot of time writing the schedule every week; I found a tool that could cut those 24 man-hours down to less than 8 man-hours, while improving the quality of the schedule. I did proof-of-concept with it, and pitched it to the director and CFO; that software is now being used throughout the company.</li></ul><ul id="yui_3_17_2_1_1458141340018_29733"><li>I helped institute a rope-tracking system, so we could take old ropes out of circulation without trying to guess which ones they were. I helped improve the process used to cut new ropes, so staff could do rope cutting in batches, and reduce the time spent on the task by more than half.</li></ul><ul id="yui_3_17_2_1_1458141340018_29737"><li>I tracked usage patters (using about 4000 data points) of the most popular service the gym offered on weekends to learn how to improve the service; I learned which staff moved relatively quickly through their customers while delivering amazing customer service, and which ones could learn to do it faster. I learned that when the staff felt like it was really busy and clients were going to be angry, it wasn't actually so bad. I helped bring a little bit of peace to our staff during peak hours because of that information.</li></ul><ul id="yui_3_17_2_1_1458141340018_29741"><li>The gym new how to bring in new customers, but did not know anything about why customers were leaving; I started digging into the process; I stopped working there before I could go deep into that project.</li></ul><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1458141340018_29745">I still worked hard, but I no longer tried to differentiate myself by going to great <em>effort</em>; I simply aimed for great <em>effect</em>. Every single one of these improvements was hidden to me until I started thinking about solving problems.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Preparing to adopt a habit</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/04/15/preparing-to-adopt-a-habit</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many habits I wish I had.
More times than I can count, I have tried to get up early. I faithfully set my alarm for some crack-of-dawn time that leaves me with a reasonable amount of sleep, but gives me time to myself before I have to get ready for work.</p>
<p>Almost as many times, my alarm goes off, I hit snooze, it goes off again, I hit snooze again, until either it or I gives up. When it goes off, I keep sleeping. When I give up, I turn off the alarm, and keep sleeping.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>When I lived near to (and worked at) a climbing gym, I never struggled to get regular exercise; the greater struggle was, at times, to take a day off from climbing. Since both my occupation and location has changed, I get a small fraction of the exercise I once had.<!--more--></p>
<p>I would love to get into powerlifting (the only reason I would ever join a real gym) but alas, no gym within twenty minutes of my apartment has a squat rack, or lets you drop weights.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>I've never been much of a cook. I also don't eat particularly healthy, but like everyone, I wish I ate healthier food more often for less money. I'm a big fan of the Paleo-ish diet, for a number of reasons. (The "ish" refers to how rigidly I follow the proscribed food choices.)</p>
<p>I eat a healthy breakfast, but that's because if I don't, I'm starved by 10am. I eat sweet potatoes more often than I once did. I enjoy Chipotle that much more, knowing that food is good for me. I eat a little less bread than I once did. This is about how much my eating has changed with the knowledge of what food is good for me, and what food is bad for me.</p>
<p><strong>Lots of failure, or a little success?</strong></p>
<p>I have had far more "failures" than I have had "successes".</p>
<p>I have had clear instances where I have broken from habit and adopted (briefly) the changes I want to have.</p>
<p>Those two sentences say the same thing.</p>
<p>Right now I am <em>preparing</em> to adopt the above habits.</p>
<p>- I've begun an extremely brief (ten minutes a day) daily workout plan.</p>
<p>-I still try to set my alarm early, and sometimes I wake up on time feeling great.</p>
<p>-I am slowly and with great difficulty learning to cook a variety of healthy meals.</p>
<p><strong>It is safe to fail</strong></p>
<p>Habits start out as delicate things. I'm not willing to even call a pattern of mine a habit until it's so entrenched I'm in no danger of losing it. If I call a bunch of little attempts and goals "habits", I have labeled myself "someone who is bad at forming habits."</p>
<p>If I take a step back and try to learn how to build habits, I can freely engage in "habit-building behaviors" without fear of failure. If a habit does not stick, I still learned something, and I can apply it to my next endeavors.</p>
<p>The potential payoff is enormous, and the potential harm is minimal. I'm not putting my self-worth on the line.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>What habits are you trying to build, and how do you feel when it does not go according to plan?</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>I find the key to making any behavioral change stick is the emotion you expect to bring from it. If you only change your environment, like changing jobs or buying a new car or house; or change your behavior with willpower, like creating a New Year's resolution; or change your thoughts, like the Secret, you might get lucky and find something you like, but in the general case you don't know if the new thing will make you happy. If it doesn't make you happy you'll eventually stop doing it in favor of something else.
But if you identify what emotional reward it will bring and figure out how to create it, when you get it, you'll keep at it. Your emotional system will motivate you to keep getting that reward, no pushing required. You might need physical pushing, but not emotional.</p>

      <title>Becoming an Early Riser</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/04/22/becoming-an-early-riser</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>"Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise." - The man no child likes to hear about when being awoken by their parents
Getting out of bed is a struggle. I've spent the better part of twenty four years setting my alarm as late as possible so I could have a few more minutes of sleep.</p>
<p>I fight myself with tenacity. My first tactic is to subconsciously turn off my alarm, so I don't even get to think about getting up early until two hours later.</p>
<p>Next, the fog of sleepiness is heavy upon me, and I'll try to hit snooze a few times. <em>"Did I set a two minute snooze, or a fifteen minute snooze?"</em> I'll hit it three or four times either way.<!--more--></p>
<p>Next, I talk myself out of the very need to get up early.</p>
<p><em>"Do I need a shower in the morning?</em> <em>Nope, I took one the day before yesterday. Breakfast? Overrated. I'll get some Dunkin Doughnuts on my way to work. I don't need to wake up early just to read a book. I'll do that while I eat breakfast. It's mean for my alarm to go off when my wife doesn't even need to get up yet. I'll just turn it off, for her... zzzzz"
</em></p>
<p><strong></strong>I have gone through those steps above so many times. I'll dutifully set my alarm for 6:30 or 7:00 on a weekend, and earlier during the week. I'd plan my whole productive morning out. I'd go to sleep, and next thing I know, it's time for me to go to work, or each lunch (on a weekend) and I have a vague recollection of hitting the snooze button a half-dozen times before my alarm just stopped going off. Whoops</p>
<p>I couldn't even think about the alarm in the morning. I couldn't create enough mental alertness to even begin the struggle to wake up early. My subconscious was waving a white flag without me being awake enough to notice.</p>
<p>And then I had a few realizations...</p>
<p><strong>Unnecessary early morning decision-making</strong></p>
<p>My approach to sleep and waking up has been shifting the last few months. Here are the reasons why:</p>
<p>1. <em>I learned about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep">polyphasic sleep</a>. </em>In a normal eight-hour period of sleep, the average person gets two hours of REM sleep, which is the stage where most of the benefits of sleep come from. As you sleep throughout the night, you cycle in and out of REM.</p>
<p>You can train your body to more quickly drop into REM sleep, and as you do this, you can remove the rest of that time you spend asleep. There are many varieties of sleep schedules,<a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/forums/health-fitness/1638-switching-biphasic-sleeping-start-here.html"> and a community of people who pursue these patterns.</a></p>
<p>The ultimate extension of this principle of needing only two hours of REM sleep a day is something called the "uberman", and it is six twenty-minute naps every four hours. Two hours of REM sleep a day, and nothing else. <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/10/polyphasic-sleep-log-day-1/">The adaptation period looks rough. </a></p>
<p><em>My perspective on sleep changed - I don't have to feel tired just because it's early. I may actually be tired, or, more likely, I have not yet reached a stage of alertness, because technically are the most rested immediately after waking up.</em></p>
<p>2. <em>I learned to pay closer attention to my body and energy levels.</em> I noticed that I sometimes felt wide awake when my alarm when off, even if it was very early, while I could just as easily feel very tired and not want to wake up, but that feeling <em>was not related to how much sleep I got</em>.</p>
<p>I started recording if it was easy or hard to get out of bed in the mornings (I'd simply write down a check or an x, depending on how it felt getting out of bed.) The benefit if this was two-fold: First and most importantly, I am training myself to not dread the morning (or being up early) simply because it is the morning and early. I no longer hate the idea of waking up at 5a. I am not always, or even often, able to easily get up at 5a, but the idea does not make me want to die.</p>
<p>Second, I am growing to pay attention not to absolute time (whatever time my alarm goes off) but energy levels. I can wake up at 7:30a with a worse energy level than when I wake up at 5:00, and I am learning to try to avoid simply low energy levels rather than the earlier time.</p>
<p>3. <em>I dramatically changed my understanding of willpower. </em>My original attempts to wake up early took a Herculean expenditure of willpower. I would <em>fight</em> to drag myself out of bed, and on the rare occasions that I was successful, I'd spend the morning wasting time on Facebook. <em>I'd drag myself out of bed at 6a on a weekend so I could watch youtube videos and waste time on Facebook! </em></p>
<p>I've learned that willpower is like muscular power. It can be exhausted, and I was exhausting myself. If I spent all my willpower getting up, I had none left over to intelligently direct my activities to productive uses.</p>
<p>The goal is to "automate" early rising so it takes no willpower, leaving me to use it intelligently throughout the day. When my alarm goes off early, if I don't really want to get out of bed, I just turn it off and go back to sleep. No guilt, no disappointment, and no wasteful expenditure of willpower. On the flip side, if my alarm goes off and I feel energetic, I happily begin my morning - no wasteful expenditure of willpower.</p>
<p><strong>Setting the stage for the habit</strong></p>
<p>I want to make it a habit, to wake up at 5a every day. I've been experimenting more heavily over the last two weeks, and have woken up by 5:30 almost half of the days. I see myself as practicing and laying a groundwork for this habit, because right now I don't fully understand. My energy fluctuates during the day, and if I am sleep deprived, its hard to get up early the next day.</p>
<p>I am learning to work a 20 minute nap into my day in the early evening, to see if this reduces the fatigue I feel the next day.</p>
<p>I am learning how coffee affects my sleep schedule, and how much leeway I have in when I go to bed.</p>
<p>Eventually, when have build a solid understanding of my own sleep requirements, I will have a 30 day "trial" where I will implement this habit every day, but I'm not ready for that yet. I don't want to set my expectations too high, fail to meet them, and then feel bad about the whole thing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Habits, Milestones, and Climbing</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe4de4b0278244ce9f1c/1434910429845/pic-04292013-003.jpg"><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe4de4b0278244ce9f1c/1434910429845/pic-04292013-003.jpg" alt="" title="My &quot;dashboard&quot; that listed my exercise and sleep patterns for two weeks." class=" wp-image-735  " /></a>
Since April 9th, I have spent exactly 70 minutes training for climbing. Prior to April 27th, I have climbed exactly seven times in the last five months.</p>
<p>I just spent two days at the New River Gorge and exceeded my expectations, considering my almost half-year hiatus from regular climbing.</p>
<p><strong>Return on Investment</strong></p>
<p>I've been training my climbing-specific strength every other day using a metal door frame in my apartment - it takes exactly ten minutes, and I record exactly how much of each task I accomplish, so I can see trends (hopefully upward) over time.<!--more--></p>
<p>For those of you who are interested in the details, I'll explain that below. If you are interested in principles and not in climbing, skip this part:</p>
<p><em>The Training Regimen:</em></p>
<p><a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe4de4b0278244ce9f23/1434910429539/pic-04292013-007.jpg"><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe4de4b0278244ce9f23/1434910429539/pic-04292013-007.jpg" alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-739 " /></a></p>
<p>Through a totally non-scientific process, I came up with the following ten-minute workout. Each minute I begin the task, and if I finish it before the minute is up, I can rest. If I can't complete the task, I record how many reps I did. The first three minutes are an abbreviated warm-up.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Ten pullups, then a 15 second L-sit with arms at 90 degrees</em></li>
<li><em>One frenchie in an L-sit position, holding each position for five seconds.</em></li>
<li><em>Three pullups using three fingers</em> (on each hand, obviously - no one-armed pullups for me, yet.)</li>
<li><em>Sixteen "touches".</em> (A "touch" is where I hang from the frame, and pop up and touch a wooden beam that is conveniently placed directly above the door. It allows me to determine if I've actually reached it, or just swung and missed. It's like campusing, but I always return to the starting position, then go up with the other hand.)

<p>Using this workout, I could make a very limited time investment and track my returns. My initial gain was huge: 33-50% improvement in most areas over two weeks. I suspect, however, that <em>all</em> of that improvement was just getting back to my prior levels of strength.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Goals</strong></p>
<p>I completed my first "iteration" seven times over two weeks. I had significant improvement from the first workout to the last. Two things kept me motivated to keep trying hard at this workout:</p>
<p>1. <em>I wanted to improve at least one number every single time I exercised</em>. I had seven different exercises to try, and plenty of opportunity to push one just a little higher. Since I was recording my progress and could see exactly how many reps I could do my last workout, it took zero mental effort to know how much I was aiming for time time around.</p>
<p>2. <em>I knew I was going to the New River Gorge soon.</em> This trip happened over the weekend, and while I did not climb as well as I did when I was able to climb ten hours a week at the gym, I climbed much better than I should have for not being able to train on a wall for five months. I was motivated to train because I would be able to compare my strength against the real world of outdoor climbing. It wouldn't be me vs. a door frame any more, but me vs. well-established routes at one of the best crags in America.</p>
<p><strong>My Benchmark</strong></p>
<p>I am now updating the climbing portion of my exercising. (Every other day I alternate training for climbing and Kettle Bell Swings) I will focus on more dynamic movement, and I'll start adding weight. I am heading back to the NRG in a month or so, so I will get to give my "benchmark route" another attempt.</p>
<p>The route is called <em>Lactic Acid Bath</em>, and it's a steep route that, as the name suggests, easily generates tremendous amounts of lactic acid. I've tried it a half-dozen times over the years, always to be amazed at the sheer power and endurance required to send such a route. Late 2011 was the first time I was strong enough to do all the individual moves, and I was able to finish it. Mid 2012, when I was in very good climbing shape, I did it with one fall. That is the best I've done on LAB.</p>
<p>This weekend, after five months of barely any real climbing, I was able to get to within three moves of my prior high point. (For those of you that know the route, I <em>barely</em> got to the knee-bar rest a few feet above the crux undercling section.) I was too tired to go any farther, but I was still tremendously pleased.</p>
<p>The biggest breakthrough I have had recently is not specifically the training, but this method of training - building a workout and meticulously recording my progress. Without those meticulous records, I would not be able to see much improvement at all, and I would quickly grow demotivated and bored. I am now excited every time I get to work out, to try to push one or two numbers on rep farther.</p>
<p>How about you? Do you record your progress with great detail when you train? If you're at all like me, you don't record that stuff - you'd rather just climb.</p>
<p>Do you think you should start tracking (in detail) your training?</p>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Sounds great. I think my friend Kim is doing something similar and she improved exponentially in 6 months. I should do the same. Problem is to kick my butt to decide doing stuffs I don't enjoy. I know it does not take much time, but still, it is time I can spend taking pictures or gardening. So motivation is the key. I think I am getting there (making the decision), thanks to Kim. I'll try your method or a lighter version of it. Yours is a little talibanic for my taste (I mean considering how lazy I am). I'll let you know how it goes. There will be a test soon. I am going to France in 10 days and I will probably climb only three days out of 15. Perfect test. See if I can come back in the same shape or better.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Hey Claire - It sure is hard getting your butt in gear to train for things you don't enjoy.
I've been reading and thinking a lot about how to motivate oneself - and testing a lot of different ideas, with varying degrees of success. I will write about that all soon, and hopefully we can keep this conversation about motivation going!</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>Lifestyle Design (AKA Intentional Habit Building)</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/05/03/intentional-habit-building</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The top New Years resolutions indicate that Americans know they need to make changes. The top three resolutions always relate to getting in shape, eating better, spending time better, and spending money better. <em></em>
Everyone is aware that change is good, even necessary, but given the rate of failed attempts to implement new habits, it's harder to implement than to plan. I've spent the last few months slowly learning about how to get better at the implementation side of things - thus far, I'm not too good at it, but I've been learning a lot along the way, and I have very high hopes for the future. I'm going to try to explain how I see the relationship between habit building, will-power/motivation, and self-evaluation. This could be lengthy - it's probably not for everyone - but I hope it will be helpful to some.</p>
<p><strong>"Trying hard" doesn't cut it<!--more-->
</strong></p>
<p>A traditional understanding of habit building is thus: "If you can do it for 30 days, it's a habit, so just push through that month, and you're good to go."</p>
<p>I have no idea if this is true - I've tried to reach that magical 30 day mark a number of times and have never been able to do it. I've tried with various forms of exercise, waking up early (that attempt was a joke. I woke up early zero times), modifying spending habits, writing, flossing, cooking, reading, and probably a dozen other attempts.</p>
<p>Not only did I not reach the 30 day mark, but my attempts were comically short-lived, but not for lack of effort or desire. From my attempts to wake up early (didn't happen once, and I've tried a lot of times) to my attempts to floss (it worked great, until I forgot completely to even try to make it a habit), I've had almost zero success at <em>intentionally</em> creating habits.</p>
<p>Now, how much success have I had <em>unintentionally</em> creating habits? I've achieved a 100% success rate, <em>without even trying!</em> Some habits are good, and others are bad, but just about every habit I have has spontaneously arisen. And I run my life by habit - far more than I like to consider.</p>
<p>Habits are a lot like instincts - it's what we do without thinking about it. If someone raises their hand to slap you, you cringe, or put your hands up, or fall in a heap on the floor. All without thinking. Instincts can save your life or kill you, just like habits. By examining how our <em>current</em> habits have arisen, we can learn how to take control of that process for our own benefit.</p>
<p><strong>Willpower - Never there when you <em>really</em> want it
</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Forget natural gas, coal, water, or cute baby seals - willpower is man's most important resource, and it is in awful short supply. We (mankind) used to think that those who got a lot done had more self-control, or willpower, or discipline, or motivation, or whatever. That seems to be the inescapable conclusion of t<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsSC2vx7zFQ" target="_blank">his video.</a> Or, if you're into climbing, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0vOH_XGWFU">this video</a> may be motivating.</p>
<p>Here's the point of both videos: When the video finishes, don't you feel like you want to go out and work really, really hard? The path seems clear, and it's marked by blood, sweat, and tears - it fits with out perspective of how this sort of success is achieved.</p>
<p>These stories makes sense, right? If we want something, we'll work hard for it. If we're motivated, we'll push through. If we psych ourselves up enough, and get angry, we'll ignore our weaker self who's begging for rest, food, and socialization - you know, all that useless stuff.</p>
<p>It all makes sense, except it is <em>dangerously</em> wrong.</p>
<p>(To help communicate these ideas, I've created very advanced graphics, for your educational enjoyment)</p>
<p><a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe4ee4b0278244ce9f37/1434910429232/pic-05022013-0011.jpg"><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe4ee4b0278244ce9f37/1434910429232/pic-05022013-0011.jpg" alt="" class=" wp-image-752 " /></a></p>
<p>Most people start a new project starry-eyed and excited. No shame there, of course. We humans usually don't try to do things without some sort of good reason.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if your motivation is very, very high, there is only one direction it can go. Down. Way down. Please note how that line in the graph (X-axis is time. Y-axis is motivation) plunges, then ceases to exist.</p>
<p>Humans are <em>meaning-makers</em>. This means we find meaning  everywhere, and we often make our next choices based on what's recently happened. If your motivation evaporated, you want to stop trying. Trying is now making you miserable instead of motivated. You don't want to be miserable, right? The whole reason for trying this new thing was to be in a better place than you are now. So, you rightfully stop trying.</p>
<p>After repeating this frustrating cycle a few more times, you have decided that you are simply not a person who can make new habits/do hard things/change your own course in life/ignore the status quo. There are those who can do that, and they have innate abilities to do amazing things effortlessly. It must be effortless, after all, because their life seem joyful and your life becomes miserable whenever you try the same things.</p>
<p>(For proof that the thing that makes one person feel amazing makes another one miserable, please refer to: "professional" students, marathon runners, readers, and healthy-diet-eaters.)</p>
<p><em>We tell ourselves we can't accomplish goals because we don't have enough motivation, but this is far too simple of an explanation. </em></p>
<p><strong>Context matters, and it's subtle</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe4ee4b0278244ce9f3d/1434910429743/pic-05032013-002.jpg"><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe4ee4b0278244ce9f3d/1434910429743/pic-05032013-002.jpg" alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-761 " /></a></p>
<p>I propose an alternate method to building habits, and there are two important elements.</p>
<ol>
<li>It must be <em>useful</em> to fail during your attempt.<em></em></li>
<li>You must not try very hard.</li>
</ol>
<p>These criteria are so frustrating. It's like saying "you have to run a marathon, but don't try that hard." Or "Make sure to do well in this difficult class, but whatever you do, don't spend a lot of hours studying." Following these rules takes careful thought and (yes) work.</p>
<p>The reason failure must be <em>useful</em> is this: If your failure is an opportunity to feel shame and belittle yourself, you're learning, very quickly, that attempts to change lead to you feeling like s**t. It also means that all expended effort is wasted, and you're not only back where you started, but you're worse off. (Because of the shame and self-deprecating feedback.)</p>
<p>The reason you cannot try very hard is this: Motivation is limited. If you're expending it all to make some change in your life, you have nothing left over to make other necessary choices and you get very unhappy very quickly.</p>
<p>Science has proven (and everyone knows intuitively) that willpower/motivation/discipline is a finite resource. It's like your muscles - when you exercise, you get more and more tired, until you just can't perform like you wish you could. Then you go home, eat some food and rest, and you're ready to do it again.</p>
<p>If I try to undertake a new task, using my two rules, I must create a context in which I am more likely to succeed than not, and if I don't succeed, my instinct is to examine my context, not my willpower. An easy example is this: I try to get up early, but if I'm going to bed at midnight, I'm not setting myself up for success, huh?</p>
<p>If I start going to bed at ten I can create a context where I am more likely to succeed at my goal. If I go to bed at midnight, I don't try to get up early - why take the hit to my motivation when the context is already unfavorable?</p>
<p><strong>What did you expect?
</strong></p>
<p>When you are trying a new habit, there are huge ups and downs. It is foolishness to not expect this. Most people DO expect fluctuation, but if the expectation does not lead to preparation, it's useless. I'll talk more about preparation soon.</p>
<p><a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe4ee4b0278244ce9f31/1434910429845/pic-05022013-0041.jpg"><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe4ee4b0278244ce9f31/1434910429845/pic-05022013-0041.jpg" alt="" class=" wp-image-750 " /></a></p>
<p><em>In the last few months, I've been working towards building healthy habits in three areas. I will devote at least the next three posts to detailing my successes and failures in these areas.</em></p>
<ol>
<li><em>Waking up early
</em></li>
<li><em>Exercising daily (climbing related)</em></li>
<li><em>Getting my finances together</em></li>
</ol>

      <title>Do things that matter</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/06/21/do-things-that-matter</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Pick one: small and insignificant victories, or large and substantial victories</strong>
I wrote <a href="/blog/2013/06/14/the-list" title="The List">The List </a>recently, in an attempt to help me focus on things that move me closer to my goals. It's a lot easier to sit around and dream than it is to make things happen.</p>
<p>I am really quite terrible at forcing myself to do things I don't want to do. Especially without tangible goals.<!--more--></p>
<p>You can expend your motivation on significant things or insignificant things. In fact, if you're not careful, you will <em>have</em> to spend it on insignificant things. Lets just think of a few of the goals most Americans have: eat better, exercise more (or "get in shape"), and spend less. How many situations do you encounter every day where you have to make a decision to move toward a goal, or give in to temptation?</p>
<p>Every time you eat, every time you purchase something (purchasing unhealthy food gets you thrice - healthy eating, getting in shape, and spending less are all contradicted by that one choice.), every time you decide how to spend your time, you are either making a decision, or running on habit.</p>
<p>If you want to eat healthier, spend less, and get in shape, you can eat a certain number of "healthy" meals a week, live within a budget (not a simple task) and do a certain number of workouts a week. If you're doing all three of those things, then, if you want, you can eat fast food without wrecking your goals<strong></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Habits lead to substantial improvement. Or destroy your goals.</strong></p>
<p>The power of habit is easy for me to see in my life - every time I open up a web browser, my left hand almost instinctively type in "fa" while my right hand hits enter. This brings my right to Facebook. It happens sometimes without me ever noticing. All of a sudden, twenty minutes are gone, before I've even noticed that I'm not doing whatever I got on my computer to do. Wow.</p>
<p>Changing habits is hard. So hard that you can't do it if you're just trying to brute force your way into habit acquisition. If you spend time learning things that matter, the rest of your life is improved.</p>
<p>Do things that matter.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How to Wake Up Early</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/05/07/how-to-wake-up-early</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>An understanding of sleep, and attempts to wake up early</strong></p>
<p>(<a href="/blog/2013/07/15/waking-up-early-2-0">Read Part Two</a><strong></strong>, and <a href="/blog/2013/08/02/waking-up-early-part-3">Part Three)</a></p>
<p>My understanding of sleep has evolved. When I was born, I spent most of my time asleep (if I recall correctly...) and gradually spent less and less time sleeping, until I was down to about eight hours of sleep a night. That was my ideal amount, and if I got much less, I would be tired during the day.</p>
<p>Except sometimes I'd get less than eight hours and not be tired during the day, and sometimes I would would get more than eight hours and still be quite tired. So I ignored most of those abnormalities, tried to get as much sleep as I could, and absolutely dreaded getting up in the mornings - my alarm would go off and I would hit snooze at least three times until absolutely had to get up to get to work. If I didn't have work, I'd just sleep until it was too sunny and warm to keep sleeping.<!--more--></p>
<p>I certainly would try to get up early sometimes, and usually end up wrestling with the snooze button for an hour and a half. I would then feel even worse about trying to get up early because not only did I <em>not</em> get up, but I lost an hour and a half of quality sleep by waking myself up every fifteen minutes just to hit the alarm again. It was pretty miserable.</p>
<p>The rare instances where I <em>did</em> drag myself out of bed in the morning, earlier than I had to, I would usually just sit down at my computer and, in a fog of sleepiness, waste the entire time period I had earned on Facebook, or reading blogs, or doing other insignificant work. This pattern led to me feeling guilty about how I spent my time, since I had tried so hard to get up early, and then wasted the whole thing.</p>
<p><em>I had many instances of failure to wake up early, and felt guilt about them. The few instances where I did take up, I still felt guilt about my poor time management. I never enjoyed the process, and basically "gave up" on getting up early. I resigned my mornings to a perpetual struggle with my alarm clock.</em></p>
<p><strong>The long and slow process from "up by noon" to "sometimes up by five... if I feel like it".</strong></p>
<p>I spent months thinking about waking up early, but it was never well-defined, nor did I have a good reason to do so, other than people who were more skilled and productive than I seemed to get up early. I wanted to be like them, so I wanted to get up early too. This is all sound reasoning, right?</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>I started tracking my energy levels throughout the day, after reading <em>The Personal MBA </em>by Josh Kaufman (Highly recommended) I've got records from as far back as August 2012 (nine months ago) about my energy levels, and my sleep patterns - even then I was trying to wake up early, and was very bad at it.</p>
<p>I eventually reworked my understanding of waking up early because of two changes:</p>
<ol>
<li>I was forced to modify my understanding of how sleep works.</li>
<li>I learned about how finite a resource willpower can be.</li>
</ol>
<p>I first read about alternative sleep cycles in <em>The Four Hour Body</em> by Timothy Ferris. That led me to a very interesting <a href="http://dcurt.is/">blog</a> by Dustin Curtis, and then <a href="http://everything2.com/index.pl?node=Everyman%20Sleep%20Schedule">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/forums/health-fitness/1638-switching-biphasic-sleeping-start-here.html">here, </a>and somewhere in all that I read <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/10/polyphasic-sleep/">Steve Pavlina's sleep (b)log.</a></p>
<p>The inescapable conclusion is this: there are a lot of people out there who try some really insane sleep patterns, and they have success. If that works for them, how much easier must it be to try a much less-insane sleep hack? I decided to start the whole process by experimenting with just being awake and content with life at an early hour. If I could do that, I could decide where to go from there.</p>
<p><em>I removed (or began removing) my mental barrier to being up when it was still dark out. I saw early rising as a goal to achieve rather than a burden to bear.</em></p>
<p>The other change related to willpower - as I've touched on before, and will do so again, willpower is just like a muscle. It can be worn out and depleted. I want to preserve my willpower as much as possible to use on things that need it. If I use all my willpower dragging myself out of bed, I've ruined the rest of my day, because I used up all my willpower.</p>
<p><em>I will up early in the morning only if I want to - if my alarm goes off and I don't want to get out of bed, I don't. </em>There was a period where my alarm would go off when I <em>wanted</em> to get up, and I would not. I would repeat this pattern daily, waking up at 5:00 AM, silencing the alarm, and waking up again at 6:30-7:00 AM to begin my day. I did not guilt myself for not getting up the first time, I just used it as an indicator that I had not created the right context in which I would wake up early.</p>
<p><strong>The necessary third component (Integrating the new understanding with my rules for building habits)</strong></p>
<p>I had reworked my understanding of sleep, and given myself permission to get up only if I <em>really</em> wanted to, but there was still a problem. I did not want to get up early! I am not particularly busy, nor committed to social activities, so most of what I wanted to do during the day got done, and everything else wasn't exciting enough to make me want to get up at 5:00 AM to do it. (Paying bills! Opening mail! Reading books!)</p>
<p>The necessary third component presented itself on Lynda.com. It was a training program to teach the viewer how to better use Microsoft Excel, and exercise "hacking".</p>
<p>That's right. I got out of bed at 5:00 AM to learn Excel. What that learning represented, however, was truly exciting. There are projects I am excited to pursue at my work that require a lot of data manipulation - since I've taken ownership of some of those ideas, I need to learn how to make them happen. A deep understanding of how to use Excel will allow me to complete some open projects of mine that are not work-related. Studying on Lynda.com represented was an opportunity for me to make a potentially large impact at work, and in my "on-the-side" work that I am pursuing on my own.</p>
<p>Exercise "hacking" was motivating because I was confident that I could get good returns on less than ten minutes of exercise a day - I was very excited to test myself in this way. I alternated between my <a href="/blog/2013/05/01/habits-milestones-and-climbing" title="Habits, Milestones, and Climbing">climbing workout</a> and Russian Kettlebell Swings.</p>
<p>I don't spend every morning learning Excel, or exercising, but I do spend that time developing skills that will allow me to exert much greater control over my career and life. <em>This</em><em> makes me excited to get up early every morning</em>.</p>
<p>I use my desire to wake up in the morning as a useful indicator for if I think I can move myself in a positive direction with various bits of training or learning. I'm generally pretty excited to learn new things or read good books - thus far, this general enthusiasm has been very effective at motivating my early rising.</p>
<p>When I wake up early and I don't want to actually get out of bed, I have to re-examine the way that I would spend my morning. What am I doing that is so unmotivating that I don't want to get up and do it? If I am not enthused about whatever voluntary project is before me, I modify/discard/replace that project. <em>It is not worth expending all my will power to drag myself out of bed when I don't want to get up to work on a project that is not interesting to me.</em></p>
<p>Remember - it is safe to fail often, and it should be easy. Both of these help provide valuable feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Current sleep patterns</strong></p>
<p>I have not yet made this "early rising" thing a habit - I still <em>want</em> to fail, when needed, so I can keep refining my process. If it's not easy, I don't get up. Adhering to my "get up only if it's easy" standard, however, has given me pretty good results - for thirteen of the last twenty seven days, I've gotten up before 6:00 AM. Nine of those days I've been up by 5:15 AM. With one exception, the latest I have slept is 8:15 AM. Of those mornings, I felt tired for just five of them. I consider this process to be highly successful, and I look forward to improving many aspects of how I sleep.</p>
<p><a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe4fe4b0278244ce9f6b/1434910431076/screenshot_5_6_13_5_04_pm.jpg"><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe4fe4b0278244ce9f6b/1434910431076/screenshot_5_6_13_5_04_pm.jpg" alt="Wake time for the last 25 days or so." class=" wp-image-776 " /></a></p>
<p>A key point is this: going forward, I am not considering myself an early riser - if I don't want to wake up early on any given day, I will not expend the will power to force myself up. If I don't want to wake up, I need to figure out how to improve the tasks I am choosing to spend my time on, so I want to wake up early. For example, on weekends, I still set my alarm early, but I usually don't really feel like getting up early, so I don't. This last weekend I had grand plans of getting things done, and when my alarm went off, I had grand plans of extra sleep. I kept it easy.</p>
<p><strong>So what should you do?</strong></p>
<p>Don't try to wake up early tomorrow morning. Or any time this week. Read the sources above, and start paying attention to your energy levels.</p>
<p><a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe4fe4b0278244ce9f65/1434910430454/photo-on-5-5-13-at-1-35-pm.jpg"><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe4fe4b0278244ce9f65/1434910430454/photo-on-5-5-13-at-1-35-pm.jpg" alt="Libby: Proof Reader and Professional Baby" class=" wp-image-769 " /></a></p>
<p>I recommend that you spend a week or two recording when you wake up, and how you feel when you wake up. I just write the day, when I woke up, and a check or an X by it, if I felt good or bad when I woke up.</p>
<p>Read the articles I mentioned earlier - don't read so that you can jump into the Uberman sleep schedule, but so you can familiarize yourself with being alert and comfortable at strange hours. Read them so you can learn to ignore that voice that wants to scream bloody murder when you wake up early.</p>
<p>And please, if you are going to start trying to get up early, let me know! I would love to know how it goes!</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Hey Matthew! Thanks for the comment. I hope I can help encourage people in this direction. I think it's a lot more than just deciding to start waking up early, but you've got to step back and ask "Why would I do this?"
If you don't have a good answer, it's not worth trying. And it's hard coming up with a good answer. Harder than just waking up early once or twice. </p>

I'm sorry about your involuntary early rising on account of my newest nephew... may I suggest ear plugs? Or maybe you should be able to hear him at this age... </p>

      <title>Daily Exercise - Russian Kettlebells</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/05/09/daily-exercise-russian-kettlebells</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Exercise. It makes most people either cringe or salivate.</p><p>Those of you who love exercising for the sake of exercising - you can stop reading now. This information is probably not relevant to you.</p><p>Those of you who don't like to exercise, but know you really <em>should</em> exercise regularly - keep reading!</p><p>In general, I don't like exercise for the sake of exercise.</p><p>For most of the last six years any time I exercised, it was to get better at climbing. I used to run regularly, too, until after one particularly long run (I took some wrong turns) I quit running. Cold turkey.</p><p>I hated being miserable, even though the feeling that comes after running (and sometimes during) is not so bad. Besides, I climbed. I did not need any more life-consuming sports.</p>

      <a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe4fe4b0278244ce9f71/1434910432064/pic-05062013-005.jpg" ><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe4fe4b0278244ce9f71/1434910432064/pic-05062013-005.jpg" alt=""/></a>


<p>Well, I still climb, but now my training is broken down between occasional weekends spent climbing, and the rest of the time training about ten minutes every other day for either climbing or "general exercise".</p><p>It sounds pretty relaxing, and it is. I love it.</p><p>I am getting stronger on an extremely modest time investment. When I climbed indoors, I usually wouldn't even have my climbing shoes on within the first ten minutes, and once I did get them on, it would take two hours to get in a good session, <em>and I was never confident that I was getting stronger</em>.</p><p>I did many different things in a gym, most of them probably useless, and a few things (which ones? I don't know) helped me get better at climbing.</p><p>As I was planning my climbing training, another exercise came to my attention. It's called "The Swing", referring to Russian Kettlebells. I first read about it in <em>The Four Hour Body</em>, and on <a target="_blank" href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2011/01/08/kettlebell-swing/">Tim Ferriss' blog</a>, and then I learned about the huge (cult-ish) following kettlebells have. I read long <a href="http://www.riversidekettlebells.com/2009/03/top-10-benefits-of-kettlebell-training.html">lists of reasons </a>why they were great, and then I learned how to make one myself.</p><p>I swung by Home Depot, and bought the necessary pipe fittings.&nbsp; There are plenty of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zq9Yxn5a9D8">good tutorials</a> on how to build your own kettlebell, so I won't go through it here. One note, however, is this: I originally used 4" pipe nipples, but the handle was so large I was hitting my legs when I was doing the swings, so as you can see, I used 3" pipe nipples. (Stop giggling)</p>

      <a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe4fe4b0278244ce9f74/1434910432154/pic-05062013-010.jpg" ><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe4fe4b0278244ce9f74/1434910432154/pic-05062013-010.jpg" alt=""/></a>


<p>I had weight plates from high school, so I didn't have to try to scrounge those up, but I'm sure that with a little checking around Facebook or Craigslist, you could find someone willing to give you (or sell you for very cheap) the weight plates. I have 55lb on mine, and I don't have any desire to make it any heavier, yet.</p><p><strong>The Workout</strong></p><p>I begin my workout by carrying the apparatus from the bedroom to the living room (eight steps) and then I do a few squats and some light stretching. I get a timer set up, and then I begin. I complete 100 swings in as short a time as possible. The first time or two I did the exercise, I had to take breaks every fifteen or twenty swings, now I'm up to being able to do up to 65 in a row. When I get too tired to keep doing the swings, I rest for about 30 seconds, then I get back at it, until I've completed all 100.</p><p>I have 55lbs on the kettlebell, which is the higher of the "recommended weights" for men. Women are supposed to start in the 22-35lb range, I think. I just experimented with a weight that was too hard to swing more than twenty times or so my first attempt - that's the general suggestion for figuring out how much weight to use for this exercise.</p><p><strong>Why all the work?</strong></p><p>There were two primary reasons I decided to pursue this single exercise using this single tool.</p><p>1. <em>It is convenient</em> - I keep the kettlebell in our apartment, sitting out of the way next to our dresser. I can exercise barefoot, in my boxers, any time of the day, with zero prep time or drive time. Total time spent on this exercise, including travel time: seven minutes.</p><p>2.<em> It is effective (</em>and moderately interesting) - the return on time invested is huge, and the exercise is interesting enough to keep my brain engaged.</p><p>Some of the most exciting strength benefits from this exercise has to do with my lower back - I've often had lower back pain, like most Americans, and couldn't ever do anything about it. Once, a long time ago, I started doing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlift">deadlifts </a>(wearing a onesie, just like that guy) and found that my lower back pain disappeared. I was thrilled. When the pain came back, I had looked into exercises that were similar to the deadlift, so I could eliminate that pain. I then stumbled onto Kettlebells.</p><p>Much ink has been spilled writing about kettlebells, and crossfitters love them. I won't regurgitate all that I've read about Kettlebells, because I wouldn't be able to do so well anyway.</p><p><strong>Results and progress tracking</strong></p>

      <a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe4fe4b0278244ce9f7a/1434910431074/screenshot_5_9_13_7_51_am.jpg" ><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe4fe4b0278244ce9f7a/1434910431074/screenshot_5_9_13_7_51_am.jpg" alt=""/></a>


<p id="yui_3_17_2_2_1462535301661_2028">As I mentioned with my climbing workout, progress tracking is very, very important. It's the only way to track incremental improvement, because you sure won't remember many details about your improvement, especially a few days after the fact.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_2_1462535301661_2031">This graph on the right shows my time, from the first attempt, to the most recent, which was twelve sessions. It's improvement indeed. Even if I did not rest, it would still take me almost three minutes, so I'm close to "maxing out" my time on this exercise. When I do that, I'll move to heavier weights.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_2_1462535301661_2034">As you can see, I barely spend any time at all on this particular exercise. The <em>first </em>session took six minutes. That's all the exercise I do on my Kettlebell days.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_2_1462535301661_2040">The time savings alone should intrigue anyone who's interested in daily exercise but does not love the idea of carving out an hour to do so. If you have questions about how to build one, or start on your own, please let me know!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How to be an awesome belayer</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/05/12/how-to-be-an-awesome-belayer</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><em>For the next few posts I am going to geek out on sport climbing. If you're not a climber (or a sport climber), these are not for you. All of this information is in the context of sport climbing on trustworthy protection - not trad climbing!</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="/blog/2013/06/06/climbing-in-decking-range">How to belay when your climber is in decking range</a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="/blog/2013/05/17/friends-dont-let-friends-shortrope">Don't shortrope your climber</a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>How to be an awesome belayer
</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">There are two reasons to be a good belayer - first, it takes one to know one. Second - you'll understand how safe (or unsafe) it can be for <em>you</em> when you are climbing, because you will learn what to expect when climbing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A good belayer <strong>a</strong><strong>lways has the right amount of rope out and when the climber falls. </strong>As a general rule, the "right amount of rope" means having a small droop of slack between you and the first bolt on the climb. Additionally, you want to be standing within one large step of the spot on the ground that is directly beneath the first bolt. <em>Do not walk way off to the side. One large step. No farther.<!--more--></em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Next, no matter what sort of device you're using, <strong>keep the belay device in the brake position</strong>. If you are using a Gri-Gri, use it the <a href="http://www.petzl.com/us/outdoor/grigri-experience">way it was intended</a>. <em>Do not hold it in your hand the whole time you're belaying!</em> It's a hard habit to break (I held it in my hand for years... and finally stopped after getting a good demonstration from a Petzl rep. Just do it right.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you're using a tube-style belay device, keep it in the brake position <em>at all times</em> unless you are taking in slack. It is possible to feed slack quickly, without ever coming out of the brake position.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Be good at feeding and taking in slack</strong>. When you feed slack while your climber is clipping, step in towards the wall, to get an extra few inches out. Immediately return to the brake position. <a href="/blog/2013/05/17/friends-dont-let-friends-shortrope" title="Friends Don’t Let Friends Shortrope"><em>Do not short rope your climber.</em></a> It makes him wonder if you're paying attention, or, if you <em>are</em> paying attention, it makes him wonder if you know what you're doing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When your climber falls, <strong>give a soft catch. </strong>To give a soft catch, step in towards the wall and give a hop up the wall, just as their weight hits the rope. If you do it right, you will float a few feet up the wall. <em>This makes all the difference for the comfort of your climber. </em></p>
<p dir="ltr">There will be situations where your climber will feel run out. He may be trying to clip having problems getting the rope through the draw, or maybe there is no good clipping position, or the clipping position is very high relative to the bolt. In all of these situations, your climber is aware of how far he will fall if he comes off the wall. Your job is to understand what to do if this happens so you can minimize the distance that he falls while <em>still giving a very soft catch</em>. The solution is simple - if your climber falls with a lot of rope out, while they're falling, pull in a full arm-length of slack, lock off the belay device, and then as their weight hits the rope, jump up the wall.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is a big topic, however. Belaying, and learning to trust a good belayer, is a long topic. All of these steps can be taught, and refined. It takes practice, however, in an environment where it is safe to fail (but don't drop your climber, obviously) and where the odds are stacked in your favor to quickly learn and perfect each of these elements.</p>
<p>Next, we will talk about how to systematically build a very high degree of confidence in each of these areas.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Friends Don't Let Friends Shortrope</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/05/17/friends-dont-let-friends-shortrope</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The first in a series about how to <a href="/blog/2013/05/12/how-to-be-an-awesome-belayer" title="How to be an awesome belayer">be a better belayer.</a></em>
<strong>Short rope</strong> [shawrt-rohp] <em>verb<strong>: </strong></em>The act of not giving sufficient rope to your climber.</p>
<p>Getting short roped is bad. It's not necessarily dangerous, nor does it cause you to take a whip (it can, of course) but the real reason it's bad is because it convinces your subconscious that you're climbing with an untrustworthy belayer. The reasoning is simple - if you're getting short roped, your belayer is either not paying attention, or not technically proficient. It's not just annoying, it's counter-productive.<!--more--></p>
<p>It would be unwise to push yourself when climbing with an inattentive or unskilled belayer.</p>
<p>The good news is this: if your belayer actually <em>wants</em> to stop short roping you, there is an easy fix. (If your belayer doesn't care about short roping you, stop climbing with them. Seriously.)</p>
<p>First, when the climber is clipping, <strong>the belayer should step in towards the first bolt as they feed out slack</strong>. This simple action resolves most instances of short roping.</p>
<p>Second, when the climber is clipping, <strong>the belayer needs to feed out a full arm length of slack without coming out of the break position.
</strong></p>
<p>I tried to explain both of these concepts in-depth using words, and kept coming up short, so I am going to make a short video demonstrating both, and why they make such a big difference in safety and convenience for your climber. I tried filming with the camera on my laptop, but it was all fuzzy. Stay tuned!</p>
<p><em>I would <strong>love</strong> feedback and questions. Seriously. I love answering questions.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Training for climbing (progress update)</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/06/03/training-for-climbing-progress-update</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am at the end of my second iteration of climbing training, and this is how it went and what I learned:
I completed the workout twelve times, but I took a twelve-day break between workout eleven and twelve. I first skipped a workout because I had ripped skin open on one of my fingers, and I did not want to attempt the workout with that damage, even though I could have taped it. I skipped the next one because I didn’t really want to do it, and was short on time for the day. Next I felt sick, and then I was on a work-related trip for a week.<!--more--></p>
<p>So, without even trying, I took almost two weeks off from training. And I am glad I did so; Friday and Saturday I experienced occasional throbbing pain in my elbow. I’ve felt it before, and it’s early-stage elbow tendonitis. It did not show up until I had <i>not</i> climbed for almost two weeks, so I am glad I took it easy recently. In the future I will continue to take breaks from training, so my tendons can recover.</p>
<p>This last weekend I <em>was</em> going to climb in the New River Gorge, and I was going to see if my training had netted any improvement. As myself and a few others were driving there Saturday morning, my car decided to overheat and vent coolant all over the inside of the hood. Thanks to kind and knowledgeable West Virginians, we were able to temporarily repair what is probably catastrophic damage (supposedly a blown head gasket) and drive my car back to DC. I'm not positive what caused the problem but it certainly ended the trip. The down side is we didn’t climb for the weekend; the upside is the car is still drivable. (For a while I was afraid I would have to have to get it towed 150 miles back to DC. Expensive.)</p>
<p>I trained hard but didn’t see the improvement I’d hoped with my heavy pulls. I would saddle myself with up to 20 pounds of weight and do my dynamic touches. There was not a lot of change in that area, although I am still glad I did them. My largest improvement came from my static hangs – I would have ten pounds on me and hang from three fingers for as long as I could. I certainly got stronger in this area.</p>
<p><a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe4fe4b0278244ce9f80/1434910431653/screenshot_6_2_13_4_02_pm-e1370203593168.jpg"><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe4fe4b0278244ce9f80/1434910431653/screenshot_6_2_13_4_02_pm-e1370203593168.jpg" alt="" title="Iteration Two" class="wp-image-833  " /></a></p>
<p>I feel better at my two finger hang as well. I was initially barely able to get my weight off the ground, and now I have hit ten or twelve seconds a few times.</p>
<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>
<p>I am now thinking about how to change my workout. I don’t want to focus on weighted touches as much, for the time being – I want to work on my finger strength. Specifically, I want to work toward one-hand dead hangs. I have some ideas, but I know that it will take a while to get there. It’s critical that I implement good progress tracking, and reward myself for hitting mini-milestones along the way. It’s too big a goal to just aim for one-handed hangs. I would grow discouraged well before I ever got there.</p>
<p>I am enjoying this training. I enjoyed my break, but I am excited to get back into the training. I feel like I'm in a good place, when it comes to motivation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Climbing in "decking range"</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/06/06/climbing-in-decking-range</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In indoor sport climbing, as your climber progresses from the ground to the first three bolts, you need to be ready for any situation. Here's how to give a kick-ass lead belay when your climber is close enough to the ground they could <strong>potentially</strong> deck. This is part of a <a href="/blog/2013/05/12/how-to-be-an-awesome-belayer">series on lead belaying</a>.</em></p><p>Have you ever encountered hard moves right off the ground? If you can't make it to the first bolt, you know you'll land on the ground if you fall. No big deal. If you make the first bolt, and get to the second one and can't clip, or if you have to make a committing move past the second bolt in order to clip, all of a sudden, hitting the ground is a real possibility, and you don't really want to do that, right?<!--more--></p><p>If you're like me, and you don't completely trust your belayer, climbing becomes <em>scary</em>, because I'm now focused on not hitting the ground. Heady stuff, for something you do for fun.</p><p>This situation is why <strong>you</strong> need to be an awesome belayer when your climber is between the first and second bolts. You should never expect (or demand) that your belayer be better than you.</p><p>I'll address a few common situations, and explain what to do in each. Hopefully I'll help you sketch out a mental picture of what to do, then you can get in the gym and practice a bit. I'll close with how you can build all these skills in the comfort of your local climbing gym.</p><p><em>Disclaimer: Climbing is dangerous. Falling from before the third bolt can result in you hitting the ground. So can falling from after the third bolt. Don't hurt yourself - start with small and safe, and work into big and safe.&nbsp;<strong>All that follows is in the context of INDOOR SPORT CLIMBING. If you're outside, you need to evaluate the landing zone, and decide how risky it is to let your climber come anywhere close to the ground.&nbsp;</strong>Outside you'll encounter boulders, ledges, trees, rocks, narrow ledges, etc. All of these things can break ankles, so you might wanna just spike your climber when in decking range outside. ;)</em></p><p>OK - from the ground up, with equally sized climbers:</p><p><strong>Climber is below the first bolt:</strong> You're spotting right now, because they <em>can't</em> be on belay. Have enough slack out that the climber can clip the first bolt without getting short roped, but not so much that you have to take in a bunch before they proper slack is in the system. Pro tip: estimate <em>before</em> they clip how much slack they need, and adjust accordingly, rather than estimating and adjusting <em>after</em> they clip.</p><p><strong>Climber is between the first and second bolt</strong>: Belay should be <em>very </em>snug, with zero extra slack, and the belayer should be out from under the climber with the bolt <em>between</em> the climber and belayer. (I.E. Not directly underneath the climber.)</p><p>If the climber falls, you need to remove as much slack as possible from the system while <em>still giving a soft catch</em>. If you remove slack from the system and don't give them a soft catch, you've spiked your climber, which is dangerous. And rude.</p><p><em>To "spike" your climber means you have short-roped them while they fall. The best-case scenario is they fall into free space and are stopped very suddenly. Worst case, as they fall, they may get pulled into the wall without being able to get their feet out, or they can "pendulum" into the wall with enough force to sprain an ankle, or break a bone.</em></p><p><em>The most common way to unintentially spike your climber is to be afraid that they will fall too far, and as they fall, you take in slack and/or move backwards and sit in the rope. (Imagine your climber was on top-rope and said "take". That action taken on top rope belay is EXACTLY what leads to a devastating "spike" on lead belay.</em>)</p><p><em>Getting spiked is mentally and physically jarring, and uncomfortable, and, if repeated, and really damage the lead climber's confidence in themselves, their belayer, and hard climbing in general.</em></p><p>To remove slack and still give a soft catch, you've got to be alert. As the climber is falling, you remove slack from the system, quickly, and get in the brake position. As their weight hits, you jump, hard, off the ground, into the air. It's possible that the climber will end up <em>standing</em> on the ground, with the belayer up in the air. Please note that this is not a ground fall - the climber, while maybe a bit startled, will have landed on the ground very softly. If the belayer is also standing on the ground, this means the climber was dropped. If the belayer is five or six or seven feet in the air, it was an awesome catch.</p><p>It's also common for the climber and belayer to bump into each other like pool balls. This is physics, and not to be feared. The reason the starting stance of the belayer matters is so that they don't hit each other on the way up. This would be uncomfortable for all involved.</p><p><strong>Climber is clipping the second bolt:</strong> The belayer has zero extra slack, has not short roped the climber, and is standing beneath the first bolt ready to take in slack and step backwards if the climber blows it before clipping. If the climber does fall, the belayer should take in slack while stepping backwards but <em>still give a soft catch</em>.</p><p>If you spike your climber in this scenario, you're really putting the hurt on. Broken ankles and severely bruised knees are in your (or their) future.</p><p><strong>For moving between the second and the third bolt: </strong>Repeat the above steps, but leave a little more slack in the system. This makes it less likely that you'll accidentally short rope or spike them, without exposing them to any additional risk. (I would contend that it's much safer to have a little more rope out. Zero downside.)</p><p><strong>Weight Differences:</strong></p><p>If there is a weight difference between the climber and the belayer, the belayer needs to adjust accordingly. I use the following rule of thumb: If the climber outweighs me by 25 lbs, I don't have to try very hard to give a soft catch - it'll just happen. If he falls between the first and second bolt, I may <em>try</em> to spike him, in order to keep him off the ground. (Since he outweighs me, I cannot cause a dangerous spike - it will just be a bit harder of a catch than normal.)</p><p>If I outweigh the climber by 25lbs or more, I have to try very hard to give a soft catch. There are two ways to do this:</p><ol><li><strong>Use a tube-style belay device</strong> (I know it's more work. You'll be OK) and let slack go through it as you arrest the fall. <strong>Do not let rope run through your hand!</strong> You will burn yourself, and be tempted to let go of the break strand. What you <em>can</em> do is, as the climber is falling, but before their weight has hit the rope, slide your hand a few inches down the rope, and then just naturally let your hand end up in the break position just below the belay device. Eighteen to twenty four inches of rope will have run through the device as the fall is arrested, and it will be much more comfortable for the climber.</li><li><strong>Belay kneeling on one knee and "stand up" into the fall</strong>. If your climber is lighter than you, and <em>especially</em> if there is any rope drag, you won't be able to give a soft catch by just jumping up the wall. You'll jump, and end up right where you started. It isn't dangerous, but it's just not as comfortable to your climber as it could be. (You want them to be comfortable falling, right?) To do this, as they're moving between bolts, belay from a knee from where you would normally stand. As they fall, still try to jump, but you'll give a much softer catch since you'll be assisting them pulling you off the ground with the muscles in your legs.</li></ol><p>In sum: Belaying is a big responsibility. It's easy to get psyched out if you're doing hard moves between the first and second bolt, or while clipping. You'll get a great return on investment if you spend a few minutes over your next few sessions practicing these skills. If you are more relaxed while climbing, you'll climb better. Practice these skills in order to grow relaxed. It won't come any other way.</p><p>In another post, I'll talk about considerations for climbing outdoors. Everything covered above is applicable, but outside you come across hazards that are not often encountered inside. (Ledges, dangerous landing zones, etc.)</p><p><strong>Practice makes perfect</strong></p><p>So, you slogged through these thousand words, and you're ready to practice. (Bless you, for reading this far)</p><p>Should you just head out, grab an unsuspecting friend, and then ask them to whip before clipping the second bolt?</p><p>Um. No.</p><p>Here's why:</p><p>Your brain is a much more powerful beast than you think it is. It is <em>constantly</em> tuned in to the environment and evaluating new sights, sounds, and situations, even when you're not paying attention to any of this. This is why music is so important to movies - when the ominous music cues up, you get a tight feeling in your chest, even if everything on the screen is hunky-dorey. Your brain knows that in all the past experiences, ominous music means bad things. Bad things make you feel anxious. Therefore, ominous music makes you feel anxious.</p><p>Your brain evaluates new experiences in light of past experiences. <em>Heuristics</em><em> </em>is a cool word that means "mental shortcut". When you encounter a new situation, your brain says "does this in any way, shape, or form, resemble anything I've encountered before? If so, repeat reaction."</p><p>The implication of this thought process is stunning, and wide-spread. We're talking about climbing, today, so I'll keep it to that. When you fall, ever, do you experience stress, anxiety, or discomfort? If so, you are teaching your subconscious to link negative emotions with falling. Every time you experience stress while falling, you're strengthening the connection.</p><p><strong>Falling, for the sake of falling, if at all associated with discomfort or stress, reinforces negative mental attitudes.</strong></p><p>The only way to get better at falling, to make it easier, is to make it pain free. Discomfort free. Easy. Rewarding.</p><p>You need to start small, and just barely outside your comfort zone, and not progress to more challenging material until your comfort zone has expanded to include the area that was once outside your comfort zone.</p><p>Here's a recommended progression:</p><ol><li>Climb to the third bolt. Clip it, and move <em>down</em> one move. Confirm your belayer is ready, and then let go of the wall. You're on top rope, so this is easy. Do it a few times so your belayer can practice timing the jump up the wall, so he can give you a soft catch. You both will be able to feel when he figures it out.</li><li>Repeat the above step, but this time, have your belayer feed out a foot or two of slack before you let go of the wall. You'll be moving a little faster, and will solidify to you both what a soft catch feels like. (Your belayer should be good at giving softer catches as this point.</li><li>Climb to the bolt, where it's level with your chest, and fall a few times. Soft catches. This should be easy. Feel free to call it a day whenever you're ready. At this point you probably have taught your subconscious that the last fifteen falls were actually pretty low key, and you should feel a sense of reward and pride. Revel in this feeling.</li><li>Climb so the bolt is at your waist. Make sure your belayer doesn't have you tight - you don't want to be short roped or spiked, remember? Fall a few times. Are you both growing comfortable with the idea behind soft catches?</li><li>Switch out with your belayer. Why should you have all the fun? Repeat the above steps, then switch back.</li><li>Climb a move or two above the bolt, take a fall. Now you're really falling. Your belayer should be giving you soft catches.</li><li>Climb another move or two, do it again. Take a fall here a few times, but not in the exact same situation. Don't get in the mindset that you have to perfectly prepare for falling - that does not transfer well to real-world climbing.</li></ol><p>Once you've completed these seven steps, you're well on your way to de-linking discomfort and falling. The work is not done, but a full progression is a whole blog post in it's own. That's coming soon.</p><p>Updated 09/12/16 (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/52fcvd/found_this_article_about_climbing_in_the_decking/d7juloj?context=10000">Thanks /u/notcrushingV16</a>)</p><p>Feedback?

I love how specific you are and how much you focus on the belay during those first 3 bolts which are so crucial to keeping a climber safe. We'll definitely add your site to our list of blogs to read regularly!</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>This is a super important topic for a person like myself who is breaking through from beginner to moderate lead climbing.
I think the tricky part that requires the most practice is giving a soft catch at the first 3 bolts, which may require little/no slack in the system or even the belayer to jump backwards.</p>
<p>More specifically, how do you jump backwards and give slack at the same time?</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Josh, the part about mental conditioning is excellent. People forget that the human brain is constantly being conditioned (whether we like it or not), and can be conditioned into, or out of, any fear. Consider driving on the Beltway during rush hour: far more dangerous that lead climbing if something goes wrong. But because the frequency of accidents is low, we are stress free and comfortable inside our car bubble, andare even willing to add to the danger of driving by texting or eating simultaneously.Conditioning your mind to be free of fear during lead climbing takes MANY positive experiences, especially if you have had a bad experience in the past.
My belayer, Helen, and I started falling intentionally during EVERY climbing session last year, and estimate that we each took over 1000 falls that year. We quickly became comfortable with falling. Now Helen has taken a bunch of time off climbing for work reasons and the fear of falling is creeping back again. Time for more whipper therapy!
If fear is cramping your climbing performance, find a belayer you trust, and don't let one session go by without practicing falls.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Good stuff, Josh, thanks for writing this. After about a year of lead climbing, I'm still pretty nervous about lead falls, as well as concerned about belaying correctly when my climber is falling. So all this is very helpful. I took a genuine (as in, unexpected) fall at the top of a 5.11 a few months ago, and ended up with what felt like whiplash. It all happened pretty quickly, so I'm not sure how well my belayer did his job, but I'm guessing it probably had more to do with my being very tense as I fell. So I am also guessing that continued whip training such as you describe would also be beneficial by helping a climber feel more relaxed through the experience and therefore avoid that kind of injury.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Hey Mark - thank you SO MUCH for pointing this out. What an oversight, on my behalf. I spent a little while Googling around, because I was so sure there had to be some definition out there SOMEWHERE, but that is not the case. I've updated the article with a definition of "getting spiked", which I have copied below:----------
To "spike" your climber means you have short-roped them while they fall. The best-case scenario is they fall into free space and are stopped very suddenly. Worst case, as they fall, they may get pulled into the wall without being able to get their feet out, or they can "pendulum" into the wall with enough force to sprain an ankle, or break a bone.</p>
<p>The most common way to unintentially spike your climber is to be afraid that they will fall too far, and as they fall, you take in slack and/or move backwards and sit in the rope. (Imagine your climber was on top-rope and said "take". That action taken on top rope belay is EXACTLY what leads to a devastating "spike" on lead belay.)</p>
<p>Getting spiked is mentally and physically jarring, and uncomfortable, and, if repeated, and really damage the lead climber's confidence in themselves, their belayer, and hard climbing in general.
-------
Again - thanks for catching this. I appreciate it. Let me know what else is unclear. I've read it too many times to be able to easily spot these instances myself.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Hello, I really appreciate an article like this, because you are addressing one of the most important parts of climbing.
But I started reading this and got stuck where you say, "you’ve spiked your climber, which is dangerous. And rude." Well, I would sure like to know what "spiking" a climber is, and what the problems with it are, without having to guess or make assumptions. So I spent 10 minutes Googling and searching, and found that this is not a common climbing term at all. Maybe in some circles, but not in Google's worldwide search.</p>
<p>Can you please add a clear explanation in your writing, at least where you first use the term, so other people aren't left confused by it?  I doubt that I'm the only one.  Once I know what it means, I'll keep reading, because I like to understand all the important parts of an article like this, without having parts missing.</p>
<p>Thanks,
Mark</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Hi Josh,
Thanks so much for this great article! Proper active belaying is so important and I hope more climbers seek out this information and strive to become the best belayers they can be.</p>
<p>I do have a question for you…</p>
<p>My boyfriend and I are only about 10-15 pounds apart and are typically very good at reading each other and belaying accordingly. However, last night we had a little mishap and I’m trying to find out what caused it and how I can do better. We were climbing at our local gym and he was leading a difficult climb within his range. He clipped the 4th draw and was dynamically going for holds that would put the 5th draw around his chest when he fell. I felt that I had the right amount of slack out (not too much, not too little) but we ended up colliding in the air. I’m not for sure if the slack that was out caused extra force to pull me up higher than normal, resulting in him falling further or if there was a mistake made on my end. I usually tend to stand under the first bolt on the opposite side of the climber. I did not step back when or pull in any slack when it appeared he would be falling. What do you think about this situation? This is the first time we’ve collided and I just want to make sure that I’m always improving my belay technique.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Hey Philippe!
It may be that you were too tense as you fell, but it's also possible that your fall was stopped a bit abruptly. Practice falling is great for the climber AND the belayer, to help both feel more relaxed. </p>
<p>Good luck out there!</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Hey Lyle,
Thanks for commenting. Congrats on breaking into moderate lead climbing. It is an awesome world. </p>
<p>Soft catches w/no slack prior to the third bolt are tricky. Here's how I do it: </p>
<p>1. I belay from one knee, right under the first bolt, so I'm already as low to the ground as I can be. 2. As the climber is falling, I take out as much slack as I can, while rapidly going back into the break position. 3. As their weight hits, I let myself be pulled into a standing position. Based on weight differences, I may give a little hop. </p>
<p>This works to give a short fall w/soft catch in most situations. </p>
<p>Let me know how it goes, if are willing! </p>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Hey Sara Beth,
This is a great question - I have a two part answer.</p>
<p>The first part is easy: It's not wrong, bad, or dangerous to collide with your climber in the air. It certainly CAN be, if you guys were to hit really hard, but the act of bumping into each other is not only NOT BAD but can be quite common.</p>
<p>So please don't be concerned about bumping into each other. It sounds like you were doing everything correctly to that point.</p>
<p>Here's the second part, and I can't tell you the "right" answer: It's possible that you could have kept him a little higher off the ground by stepping back and pulling in some slack as he fell *while still giving a soft catch*. </p>
<p>It's more important to give a soft catch than to keep him an extra few feet off the ground, so, based on what you told me, and the precautions you took, you gave an AWESOME belay!</p>
<p>Thanks for the question! I love geeking out about belaying.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Delila! I'm so glad it's helpful. That's my only goal. Let me know how it goes - It's really helpful for me to hear what makes sense, and more importantly, what doesn't make sense. I'll try to expand on what's needed, and cut down on what's not.
How are you doing over in Bosnia? You should blog about it.... </p>

      <title>Simplify, simplify, simplify</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/07/04/simplify-simplify-simplify</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kristi and I stumbled upon the realization that we've become minimalists.
And it is exciting.</p>
<p>We live in a one-bedroom apartment. It is spacious, for a one-bedroom, but compared to anything larger than a one-bedroom apartment, it is small. We managed to pack it full of stuff in no time.<!--more--></p>
<p>Then, an unexpected blessing came about. Our neighbors don't clean their apartment, or put much food away, so they had problems with bugs. We share a wall with them, so we got to share their problem with bugs. The landlord sprayed both of our apartments, and in preparing for that spraying, we had to pile <em>almost all of our possessions in the middle of our living room.</em></p>
<p>We realized, quickly, that we had a lot of stuff. So we got rid of stuff that we obviously did not need. Then,once we started putting things away, we got rid of more stuff. Then, we stumbled across <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clutters-Last-Stand-Time--junk/dp/1593373295/ref=sr_1_10?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372721044&amp;sr=1-10&amp;keywords=clutter">books</a> and <a href="http://zenhabits.net/start/">blogs</a> that talk about having even less stuff, in order to free up mental and physical space.</p>
<p>I don't like putting things away, but I also dislike the apartment being messy. An obvious solution is to have less things to have to keep orderly. If you don't have things that can be messy, the apartment is less messy. So, for the last few months, we've been casually getting rid of things that we don't use. Here's a short list:</p>
<p>Cleats that I've not used in two years. Climbing shoes that have holes in the toes. Ditto with another pair. An old harness that has a <em>well loved</em> belay loop, that I really shouldn't use anymore. Shirts that I don't like, but don't hate, so I wear 'em only when I'm out of everything else. Shorts that don't fit right. Pants that I've not worn in a year. A blazer I bought for $2 at a thrift store and wore once. Uncomfortable dress shoes. Another pair of uncomfortable dress shoes. My old laptop. Belts that I don't wear. My second pair of pajama pants. All non-skinny ties. Cups we've not used in a year. A cup-cake baking sheet we've never used. Little nesting bowls we've never used. A spare set of plates someone gave us, but we never use. Tools that are made redundant by smaller and more compact tools. Extra power cables. Little trinkets of crap I never use. Random pens we never use.</p>
<p><a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe50e4b0278244ce9f9c/1434910433809/pic-06242013-001.jpg"><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe50e4b0278244ce9f9c/1434910433809/pic-06242013-001.jpg" alt="The &quot;get rid of&quot; pile, after ten minutes of work." class="size-medium wp-image-887 " /></a></p>
<p>Climbing gear that is either old and heavy, or new(er) and dangerously worn.</p>
<p>Books. So many books. <em>My book collection had become an altar to the intelligence of Josh.</em> If you visit our apartment, you'll look through our books. (At least I hope you will.) You'll think "man. He's smart, if he reads this stuff." When I look at my books, I think of what a towering intellect I am, because of my books. In reality, I'm probably not going to read most of 'em. The idea of reading them is way more fun than actually reading them.</p>
<p>I ditched the altar to myself, and cleared out two shelves worth of books. I ditched cook books, books about business, philosophy, economics. All of that. I'm a real person, I'm not going to read 600 pages about Immanuel Kant. Why kid myself?</p>
<p>Do you see the trend?</p>
<p>I got rid of all of them. We went from three crowded bookshelves to three sparse book shelves. We're going to get rid of more.</p>
<p>I don't want to be burdened down by things. Every item you own takes up space, both in your home, and in your brain. If you move, so to do your things. They are anchors.</p>
<p>I've slowly transitioned from thinking "I will keep this unless I can justify getting rid of it" to "I will get rid of this unless I can justify keeping it".</p>
<p>This trend is dangerous. I've grown to enjoy very much the process of getting rid of things. I view items around the house in a new light. If I could talk with them, I would say "You, there. What do you do for me? Why should I give you space, regular cleaning, and attention? How is my life made better by you? Why are you better than empty space, or the alternative uses for the money and space you require?"</p>
<p>As I've de-cluttered, I have been able to check off a number of items from <a href="/epic-quest" title="My Epic Quest of Awesome">My Epic Quest of Awesome.</a></p>
<p>I'm another few levels along.</p>
<p>If you could get rid of three things, what would they be? What's stopping you?</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>People often think of getting rid of stuff as losing something. If they keep it they always have the option of using it or getting rid of it later, or so they think. They value that option and discount the cost of having stuff.
I've come to think of getting rid of stuff as *gaining* freedom. My experience with books -- http://joshuaspodek.com/less_please -- was like yours. Now I cringe when someone tries to give me stuff because I feel like they're giving me an obligation.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Josh, I think this is my favorite post of yours and I'm going to make Amir read it once he wakes up. We're actually seriously thinking of coming back in 2 months, which means we'll only be able to take what'll fit in 2 duffel bags each. So we'll essentially be starting from zero once again. Instead of being scared, I'm insanely psyched about it, precisely because of the things you talk about here! It's so freeing not being tethered to STUFF. Knowing you can pack all your possessions and just GO. Wherever you want. Anyway, thank you for this awesomely inspiring post! I am SO PSYCHED to hopefully hang out with you &amp; Kristi once we do make it back :)</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>I couldn't agree with you more. I have looked at a book 3 times recently thinking, "I should probably give that away." In the mean time that book has occupied my time, my space, and my mind. I call getting rid of things in my home "jettisoning" and you have reminded me that it is time to do it again. The beauty of this philosophy is how you shift to a mindset of not wanting to bring new things into your home either unless it has a use. This leads me to ask you to post regarding holidays, birthdays, and gift giving. I can't wait for your thoughtful response.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Hey Cat! I'm glad you are enjoying my blog! The book I linked to I do recommend, but it's not the one Mom had around. I would read the little one I linked first - it's short, and doesn't focus so much on clutter-busting as it does on having less, but being more fulfilled in what you have. But... that sounds pretty similar to the clutter busting one too. I donno - read either one. Read both!

      <title>June trip to the New River Gorge</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/07/03/june-trip-to-the-new-river-gorge</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The New River Gorge had beautiful weather this weekend. The forecast for the weekend was, until Friday, near-certain thunderstorms.
Typical of the New, the weather proved unpredictable, and we had glorious sun the entire trip.</p>
<p>I was eager to get out to the New, since my last attempt to get out there was delayed by rather catastrophic car failure. I've been out of my already very limited training regimen, so I did not know how I would stack up against the rock, and against the other guys I was climbing with.</p>
<p>It turns out I can still climb, but not nearly as hard as I had hoped. I was fortunate to be climbing with guys who are far stronger than me.<!--more--></p>
<p>Brian sent Puppy Chow, 12c, and Christian repeated Lactic Acid Bath 12d, and almost onsighted Puppy Chow. Preston onsighted Yowza ,12a (for his warmup) and Sean sent a 12a that was way harder than the 12b right next to it. There were many other displays of excellent climbing, but in summary - it was a pretty strong group. I brought up the rear by making at least the first bolt of everything I tried.</p>
<p><strong>It was an awesome trip, despite me not climbing that hard, for two reasons:</strong></p>
<p>1. <em>I'm motivated to keep training</em>. Motivation is a valuable thing to have, and I'd lost it after almost three weeks of <em>not</em> training, and close to two months of no outdoor trips.</p>
<p>2. <em>I'm motivated to train smarter.</em> My endurance was terrible - this is not a surprise, given the one-dimensional nature of my training, but I'm not taking it as an excuse. I want to train endurance, just as I train power. A standard route in the new probably has about sixty moves on it, so I will figure out how to approximate sixty moves on my metal door frame.</p>
<p>I had a few other enjoyable learning experiences during my trip. For example, I had never thought about the best way to pack for a climbing trip. I just threw a bunch of stuff in a bag, and spent the rest of my trip rummaging around for items that fell to the bottom of my bag. Next trip I'll spend less time rummaging, and more time... not rummaging, all thanks to Sean's good ideas.</p>
<p>I'm launching into a new training "regimen", and I'm toying with training five days on, two days off.</p>
<p>I'm going to spend the next week fine-tuning my training. These are my tools: Door frame. Chair. Up to 30lbs on a weight belt. Space to campus up, full extension, but nothing to grab and hold that high.</p>
<p>If you guys have any suggestions, let me know. I'll publish all the suggestions I get soon!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Crock Pots are Foolproof, Right?</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/07/10/crock-pots-are-foolproof-right</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe54e4b0278244cea040/1434910435144/pic-04192013-001.jpg"><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe54e4b0278244cea040/1434910435144/pic-04192013-001.jpg" alt="The internal temperature was 175 degrees. Whoops. " class="size-medium wp-image-916" /></a>
A while back I got together with my good friend <a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/5586fe4be4b0278244ce9f01/5586fe9ee4b0278244ceab71/1434910366219/?format=original">Dustin</a>. I had an evening free, wanted to cook, AND hang out with good friends. I wanted to try a <a href="http://www.sixsistersstuff.com/2013/01/slow-cooker-maple-and-brown-sugar-pork.html">really good looking recipe</a>, and watch Django Unchained.</p>
<p>The cooking instructions for the recipe was "cook on low for 7-9 hours". I did some mental math. If I turn it on as I'm walking out the door to work, at 8:15, and get back by 5:30, that could work. I'll have to run some errands on my way home, but if I had 10% to the cook time, it can't be terrible, right?"<!--more--></p>
<p>Well... it turns out I was gone more like 10.5 hours, and my crock pot's <em>low</em> temperature setting is a little higher than<em> </em>expected.</p>
<p>I got home about 40 minutes before Dustin was to arrive, and something didn't smell quite right. I popped open the crock pot, and saw some <em>very</em> dry, <em>very</em> warm meat. It was 175 degrees. So much for not overdoing it.</p>
<p>We got take-out from Tara Thai. Zero harm, zero disappointment, and we had a great time.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The lesson</strong></p>
<p>The biggest take away for me had nothing to do with cooking. (I already knew that cooking a piece of meat for almost 11 hours is usually a bad idea.)</p>
<p>I could have freaked out when I got home and immediately learned that my dinner plans were ruined. I would have been stressed, and probably a little angry. I wasn't. This was a learning experience, and I love Thai food, so I learned, and we ate Thai.</p>
<p>My learned lesson was this: <em>A good backup plan allows for one to try hard, and even fail, with very few repercussions.</em> There was nothing to freak out about, because dinner was not ruined. It was simply modified. We went from pot roast to cashew chicken with a phone call.</p>
<p>A few days later I tried the roast again. After it was rescued from the crock pot at an appropriate time, it was delicious.</p>
<p><em>Failure can be made safe, and therefore stripped of all those annoying negative associations.
</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>I think our low setting is about 180, while old crock pots were supposedly cooking at 140 when at low. This is an important difference...
Live and learn, I hear. I wonder why the crock pots have been set at a higher temperature? </p>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>1.  Having a plan B to a cooking "adventure" is something most intrepid cooks learn quickly2.  Fattier meats like pork shoulder and blade roasts work exceptionally well.in the crock pot.  Crockpots are ways to make braises without using your oven and using time as your friend like when you barbeuce brisket in a smoker.  Pork tenderlion can be pretty unforgiving in the crock pot. There is not much fat and it dries out quickly.  And it can be pretty expensive.  Shoulder can come in at 1.19 to 149/ lb  Tenderlion at 3 times that..</p>
<p>The link below shows you that you are not alone and that there are options other than throwing it out or using it as a tire patch.</p>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Thanks for the info about what to do with destroyed meet. Those are all good suggestions. As is pork shoulder. I'll be doing that next time around. I like "forgiving and inexpensive" more than "unforgiving and expensive".

      <title>Waking Up Early 2.0</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/07/15/waking-up-early-2-0</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago, I wrote about <a href="/blog/2013/05/07/how-to-wake-up-early" title="How to Wake Up Early">waking up early.</a>
I tracked my progress for almost a month, and most of the days I woke up between 4:45 and 6:00. My "must be up by" time is 7:30a, so waking up more than an hour and a half early counts as a huge win.</p>
<p>From mid-may until June 7, I woke up consistently <em>very early</em>. I had excellent success. The reason, however, was not controlled by me. I woke up early because <em>I went to bed early</em>. My wife teaches kindergarten in Prince George's County, and had two classes of 25 kids. Her assistant principal, who's been doing what he does for about 30 years, told Kristi that her kindergarten class had some of the worst-behaved kids he'd ever seen.<!--more--></p>
<p>These rough kids (several emotionally disturbed kids, more than a few suspensions for violence, etc.) are why Kristi is teaching where she is teaching, but <em>it is exhausting</em>. This means that my wife would usually go to bed by 10:00 pm. We always go to bed at the same time, so this meant <em>I</em> was going to bed at 10:00. When I'm in bed that early, it is so easy to get up at 5:something.</p>
<p>I've figured out how to not hate getting up early; I actually enjoy it. So now the challenge is getting enough sleep so I <em>can</em> get up early.</p>
<p><strong>Don't <em>wake up early</em>
</strong></p>
<p>When I was thinking about waking up early, I lived in a context where the default was going to bed early. Since Kristi's finished teaching for the summer, our schedules (and bedtime) have developed a lot more flexibility. For the last few weeks, my bedtime has drifted towards midnight or later. I would wake up at 7:00 or so, or if I woke up early, I'd be tired throughout the day. <em>Being tired during the day sucks.</em></p>
<p>I am shifting my attitude from being one who <em>wakes up early</em> (when it's easy) to one who <em>goes to bed ear</em><em>ly.</em> I love getting up early, but until now, I'd not considered my evening ritual. I just coasted through the day until I decided it was time to start getting ready for bed, which takes an undetermined amount of time.</p>
<p><strong>Going to bed early</strong></p>
<p>My action steps for the next two weeks are pretty easy, and it's pure monitoring. <em>I am not yet trying to change my behavior</em>. I want to set myself up for success (what a trite saying, huh?) but this means having accurate expectations.</p>
<p>Without an accurate understanding of where I am now, my attempt to set correct goals hinges more on luck than good planning. To facilitate this good planning, I'm keeping track of when I go to bed. Self-monitoring generally leads to low-level improvement by itself, so I'm hoping to move in a good direction simply by paying attention to that which I want to change.</p>
<p><strong>Action Steps</strong></p>
<p>I will pay attention to two things every evening.</p>
<ul>
<li>What time I <em>start</em> going to bed.</li>
<li>What time I <em>actually</em> lay down in bed.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am tracking what time I <em>start</em> going to bed so I know how long it takes, for the same reason we all know how much time we need to get ready before we leave in the morning. If you have to leave the house at 8:00, you know your alarm has to go off at 7:15, or something like that.</p>
<p>I'm tracking what time I <em>actually</em> lay down in bed first so I can actually quantify the first metric (If I know I start going to bed at 11:15, and wake up at 6:30, that doesn't really tell me anything) but so I can know how much sleep I'm getting every night, and how I feel in the morning. Different people have different sleep needs, supposedly between seven and eight hours. I would like to better know my own sleep needs.</p>
<p><strong>Your turn</strong></p>
<p>If you're interested in waking up earlier, do this with me. I'll post your results along with mine, and you'll be (mildly) internet famous! You don't actually need to wake up at any different time than you already do, you just need to chart when you <em>start</em> going to bed, and when you <em>actually</em> go to bed. (It takes a sticky note and a pen.)</p>
<p>Leave a comment here, or shoot me an email. You don't have to start today (Monday) just sometime this week.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>If you have a smartphone, consider trying out one of the sleep tracking apps that are available. You run the app, then lay the phone down on the mattress (under the sheet) beside you while you sleep. Sounds weird at first, but I've been using one called "Sleep Cycle" on the iPhone since last December. It uses the phone's accelerometer to track your movements throughout the night, showing you a graph of how well or poorly you slept (similar to what you would get if you did a sleep study with electrodes and whatnot), and it intelligently wakes you up at a point in your sleep cycle when you are already mostly awake, as close as possible to your desired alarm time. Think of your sleep throughout the night as a sine wave that goes through repeated peaks and troughs of lighter and deeper sleep -- the app tries to wake you up as close as it can to one of those peaks, which makes you feel less groggy and better able to immediately get up rather than falling back asleep. I've had great success with it after trying all kinds of other ridiculous hacks (like putting my alarm in a different room, which never helped).
A great side benefit of the app is that it keeps a log of what time you went to bed and woke up and you can view historical trendlines. (Doesn't track what time you started getting ready for bed, though.)</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Hey Adam, thanks for the suggestion. I don't have a smart phone, so I won't be able to try that app, but I've heard of it.
You said you've tried a bunch of ridiculous hacks - what else have you tried? I'm curious what other people do to get out of bed. My most common attempts, and least successful, usually involved just making myself "do work" to turn off the alarm. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, walking across the room to turn off the alarm is no more of a barrier to going back to sleep than slapping a snooze button next to my head...</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>I have tried putting the alarm in a different room, which as you said never helped because I could always just get back in bed.
I also tried a wake-up lamp that gradually gets brighter up to your set alarm time. It's supposed to simulate the sunrise and help you wake up more naturally, but it never really worked for me except for the first few days. After the first week or so, I fell back into a pattern of only waking up once the light was at full brightness and I would have a massive headache because they tell you to put it right next to your bed for best effectiveness.</p>
<p>I've also tried blaring alarms vs. soft music, NPR, etc. None seemed to make any difference.</p>
<p>One other thing I tried which was somewhat effective was a visualization technique where, right before you go to bed, you visualize yourself waking up and getting out of bed immediately, and you repeat it in your head over and over again (like 10-15 times) before falling asleep. This supposedly helps wire pathways in your brain that will help you carry through on that action in the morning. It did seem to be somewhat effective, but I eventually fell out of the habit of doing the bedtime visualization routine, and it all fell apart.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

I tried the bedtime visualization thing for one day… the idea is not bad, but my implementation was spotty. So far, the only thing that helps me get up at a good time is going to bed early. I guess that is no big surprise. </p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>My Good Friends (Who Don't Know Me)</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/07/25/my-good-friends-who-dont-know-me</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rumor has it you become like those you spend time with. Or "birds of a feather flock together", or "you are what you eat". Maybe that last one was Hannibal Lector, <a href="http://youtu.be/09TAIcCqFpg?t=27s">having an old friend for dinner.</a>
Anyway, the person that <em>you</em> are is influenced by the people you spend time with. Ditto for me. There are three kinds of people you can spend time with: <em>real people who know you just as you know them</em>, <em>real people who do not know you, but you know them</em>, and<em> imaginary/fictitious people who have never existed.</em></p>
<p>We'll come back around to that last category in a minute. I am not insane.<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Mentors</strong></p>
<p>There are people who I know, who know me, that I seek out to spend time with. I call them <em>mentors</em>. Some of these relationships have popped up out of nowhere (thanks, Wayne), while others have been more formal. (Think <em>paid counseling.</em>) You should seek these people out, because the value you can derive from these relationships is nearly endless. Life changing. Seriously.</p>
<p><strong>Role Models</strong></p>
<p>Real people who I know but don't know me, I'll call <em>role models.</em> They are people that, for some reason or another, I want to emulate. It is important to specify the <em>way</em> I want to emulate these people. An easy example is Chris Sharma - an amazing rock climber, but sort of <a href="http://youtu.be/McWaEZPMfag?t=3s">looks like he's stoned all the time</a><a href="http://youtu.be/McWaEZPMfag?t=3s">.</a> I want to climb like him, not communicate like him.</p>
<p>Other examples: books and blogs by or about noteworthy figures (<em>why</em> they are noteworthy is entirely up to you) make up the bulk of this category.</p>
<p><strong>Literary Role Models</strong></p>
<p>In high school and college, we all had to read high quality literature. If you were like me, you didn't much care to read this stuff, for a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323823004578595803296798048">variety of reasons.</a> Since I've finished college, I've dug back into books (and learned more for less than I ever did in college - that's another discussion all together.) but I've enjoyed both non-fiction <em>and</em> fiction.</p>
<p>When I read fiction, some times it's classy (think of a famous dead author - he's classy) and sometimes it's not as classy, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Returners-Season-Part-ebook/dp/B00810TW6Y">but still interesting. </a>No matter how classy or non it is, when you spend a few hours immersed in a world of the author's creation, you're spending time with the individuals in that book. If you "spend time" with people who wrestle with hard problems and make good decisions and generally conduct themselves in an honorable, respectable way, you are surrounding yourself with people who make good decisions and conduct themselves in an honorable and respectable way.</p>
<p>Another title for "literary role models" is "imaginary friends". Don't judge. They influence you, they've just never had a physical existence.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Why Friends Matter</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I am now going to lump all three categories above into a bucket named "friends". These categories differ from your normal, every day friends in at least one specific way: <em>You must seek them out.</em> Only one of these groups of people (physical people who know you) can influence you <em>without your permission</em>. Think of a text from a friend - you didn't ask for it, but you're being influenced by its content. In the other two categories, you must seek out that person (or literary figure), and intentionally expose yourself to their influence.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Much of your family life you don't have much control over. Nor do you have control over where you <em>went</em> to school, or the friends you <em>once</em> had. Your past cannot be changed. Your <em>present</em> is mostly a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_%28mathematics%29">function</a> of your past. Your future, on the other hand, is up for grabs. If you are not intentional about influencing your future, you won't do much about influencing your present context, and, therefore, your future will largely be determined by your past.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Bear with me.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">If you want to influence your future, but you're not sure how you want to do so, consider spending time with those you want to emulate. You can emulate a professional painter not because he's a painter, but because he's a <em>professional</em>. You can emulate an amazing teacher not because he's a teacher, but because he's <em>amazing</em>. You can emulate a real estate investor not because they know real estate, but because they have figured out how to turn one dollar into two dollars. You can emulate a Buddhist monk not because they're a monk, or a Buddhist, but because they are <em>content</em>. You can emulate a passionate computer programmer not because they are a computer programmer but because they are... <em>passionate</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">You can choose who you spend time with, who you emulate. If you're not ready to follow around a physical person to be more like them, you can follow around a digital one or an imaginary one. Find out who's influenced them, and go be influenced by them.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Whatever you do, please<em>, </em>find some quality in some person to emulate. Expose yourself to that quality, to that person (without exposing yourself in the criminal sense) and you'll find yourself slowly gaining more and more influence over your future.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I will soon discuss <em>my</em> mentors, role models, and imaginary friends. I have dozens, if not hundreds. Literally <em>nothing</em> that comes out of my mouth or rattles around in my head is original, and I'd be a fool to pretend otherwise.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Do <em>you</em> have mentors, role models, or imaginary friends?</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Josh, I really enjoyed this. Particularly the bit about fiction &amp; literary "imaginary" friends. I spend a lot of time thinking about things like this: "who influences me? who has taken up the most space on my tabula rasa -- dead authors? imaginary friends? people worth emulating? people not worth emulating?" I also love having conversations about things like this. I might send you something I'm writing on fiction &amp; my faith right now.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>Cancel Your Cable. Seriously.</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/08/06/cancel-your-cable-seriously</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No one likes to waste money, right?
There are two things that are even worse to waste.</p>
<ol>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Energy</li>
</ol>
<p>Money can be earned, and if more is needed, you can spend less or earn more. Energy is what you need to bring ideas to fruition. Unlimited time with no energy gets you nowhere, as does unlimited energy with no time.<!--more--></p>
<p>Cable TV tricks you into making the wrong evaluation of the value proposition. If companies can get you to think that either <em>100 channels at $30 a month</em> or<em> 700 HD channels at $100 a month</em> is a better deal than the other option, they've won.</p>
<p>The real calculus is this: five to fifteen hours of my week wasted vs. spent intentionally. Really, you should be willing to pay your cable company the price of your bill if they could simply deliver to you additional time.</p>
<p>If the small cost of $100 month was all it took to get an extra five hours a week, I'd do immediately. I value my own time above $5 an hour, and you should to (This is why I've been trying to <a href="/blog/2013/04/22/becoming-an-early-riser" title="Becoming an Early Riser">wake up earlier every day</a>).</p>
<p><strong>If not cable, then what?</strong></p>
<p>Watching stuff is a lot of fun. I enjoy my fair share of movies, but I get them when I want them, and I don't have to watch commercials. Between Redbox, Netflix, and all the free options for watching <a href="http://www.cbs.com/shows/elementary">good shows </a>online, there's no reason that by cutting your cable you're missing out on entertainment opportunities.</p>
<p>Oh - and all commercials do is try to sell you stuff. We already know that <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/114031/money-happiness-and-new-science-smarter-spending#">things cannot buy happiness</a>. Experiences and relationships are what matter. So reject passive entertainment, spend less time exposing yourself to ads for cleaning supplies, cars, hair products, clothing, insurance, fast food, soft drinks, and all the rest of that crap. You will not go wrong.</p>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Thanks for the post. We have never had cable, too many channels, a time waster. My husband and daughter love movies so they go to Redbox or the library. They have to pick out a movie, go and pick it up from Redbox. They put movies on reserve at the library. Redbox is inexpensive,and they have to give some thought before reserving it. The library, hey, it is free. They have Friday night movie night, so it is special, not a lot of money and not a lot of time spent. We do have Tivo, so we can watch show without all the ads. Saves a lot of time and about $130 a year. Being frugal saves time and money.  Thanks for the post.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

Q: How do you know someone doesn't have a TV?
A: They tell you.</p>
<p>which is kind of funny, but they don't realize how much people with TVs tell everyone they have them in every conversation they have. They've come to think of having a TV as normal and the opposite as abnormal. I finally stopped using mine after the basic cable my building somehow gave me got cut off -- http://joshuaspodek.com/the-benefit-of-blocked-cable.</p>
<p>After you stop watching, so much changes about what you do at home and what relaxation means -- in particular, not turning your brain off.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>Rules for Fighting Fair</title>
      <link>/blog/rules-for-fighting-fair</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When a friend tells me they want to date someone, I ask them why. They always say "she's pretty, funny, and kind", or "he is handsome, funny, and cares for me". Obviously. Have you ever wanted to date someone because they are ugly, boring, and mean?</p><p>So, rather than asking more questions where they will wax poetic about the wonderful qualities of their prospective partner, I ask one simple question:</p><p>How do they fight?<!--more--></p><p>Anyone can be nice to someone when they are "in love", or when they feel it is good for them. It takes skill and character to argue fairly, and it will tell you a lot about a person in a very short amount of time. For the same reason you should pay attention to how someone treats waiters, janitors, and others who they don't <em>have</em> to be nice to. <em>It reveals a depth of character that you can't otherwise see.</em></p><p>This list I put down is the rules Kristi and I try to abide by. We don't always follow this list; but we do try. It dramatically improves the quality of our disagreements, helps us grow to love each other even more, and avoids causing damage to the relationship.</p><h2 style="text-align:center">Rules for Fighting Fair:</h2><ol><li><em>Don't yell</em>. If you start yelling, call off the discussion and come back later.</li><li><em>Don't yell</em>. If you yell, they will dig in and fight harder.</li><li><em>Don't yell.</em> If you yell, you are causing far more damage in one minute than can be undone in twenty.</li><li><em>Stop </em>fighting<em>, and start </em>discussing<em>.</em> People <em>can</em> discuss things with angry tones and mean looks. Tell the person you were arguing with that you don't want to fight, you want to figure out what's going on and make it right. A discussion can be productive, a fight cannot be.</li><li><em>Don't be so blinded by the topic at hand that you cannot listen for what heart issues are operating beneath the surface.</em><br /><br />Example 1: Her reaction to your feedback on her driving is not about driving, it's about a sense of control, and a desire to not feel out of control. She knows how to drive, but feels like her life is out of control, and your feedback makes it feel like one more thing - driving - is out of her control.<br /><br />Example 2: His procrastination is not about being lazy, but a deep, deep fear of rejection and a sense of perfectionism, which is motivated by a fear of rejection. You can nag about doing something, or you can help him understand why he is equipped to go forth and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2009/11/19/what-makes-an-entrepreneur-four-lettersjfdi/">JFDI</a>.<br /> </li><li><em>You cannot talk about "heart issues" if you are yelling and arguing</em>. So stop yelling and arguing. You are now talking in normal voices, and discussing.<br /><em>Reaffirm long-term goals.</em> (Also known as "keep your eye on the prize".) Are you trying to score rhetorical points and tear them down? If so,&nbsp;<em>you</em> are the problem, not them. Are you trying to love them and you want good things for them? Let them know. When you're fighting, it's easy to think they hate you, and that they are a miserable excuse for a person. Inform them that they are wrong. You do, in fact, love them and are committed to them. (That's true, right?)<br /><em>Don't call them names, or ascribe negative character traits.</em> They are not stupid, they <em>did something that you need help understanding</em>. They are not disrespectful, they did something that <em>seemed</em> disrespectful. Encourage them even in the way you bring up "problems". Give them the benefit of the doubt.<br /><em>You bring just as many warped perspectives and screwed up ideas to the table that they do.</em> Don't put the blame all on them.<br /><em>Arguments are frustrating.</em> Verbally "pause" the argument, and ask for a hug. Then keep talking. Or shelve the discussion and come back later.</li></ol><p>These are Kristi's additions to the above list:</p><ul><li>Don't interrupt</li><li>Don't yell (Do you see a theme here?)</li><li>Don't make sweeping statements like "never" and "always"</li><li>Phrase things like "this is what I'm seeing" or "this is how I feel" instead of "this is what you did"</li><li>Don't say "why did you do that" say "can you help me understand where you're coming from"</li><li>Listen!</li><li>Genuinely try to put yourself in their shoes</li><li>Give each other the benefit of the doubt</li><li>Never hang up on each other</li><li>Pause - remind each other that you love each other.</li></ul><p>This entire list can be summarized in one rule: <strong>When fighting, be respectful and loving.</strong></p><p>This is a tall order, for the record. We certainly don't have it figured out, but we're working on improving the quality of our fights. Already they are pretty good, and we want them to be better. I would recommend you talk with your significant other <em>regularly</em> about the quality of your arguments. It is time well spent.</p><p style="text-align:left"> </p>]]></content:encoded>

We have enjoyed reading Christian marriage books in an effort to grow our relationship with each other and with God, but there&#8217;s a lot of junk out there. Instead of wading through books containing legalism and self-help formulas, check out our list of the top 5 Gospel-centered marriage books. [&#8230;]</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>Why I use a Kindle</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/07/22/why-i-use-a-kindle</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Ereader-ebook-reader/dp/B007HCCNJU">Amazon's e-reader</a> is extremely functional. Most reasons to <em>not</em> use one focus either on practical issues (depending on something with a battery) or on aesthetic reasons. These are valid issues, of course, but these pale in comparison to the many, many reasons <em>to</em> use a Kindle.<!--more-->
<ol>
<li>Extremely portable</li>
<li> Quite compact</li>
<li>Can hold near-infinite number of books</li>
<li>Instantly acquire new books.</li>
<li>Purchased books are cheaper on Kindle than physical books (usually)</li>
<li>You can "rent" books on your Kindle from a library - without ever going to the library.</li>
<li>Easy to use one-handed, either lying down (in bed) or standing up (metro).</li>
<li>Built-in dictionary for all those words you don't know how to use. (Oh, and you can have dictionaries in just about any language.)</li>
<li>No page-turning - just tap a convenient button that is ambidextrous.</li>
<li>You can read while eating without your book falling shut.</li>
<li>You can hold it with one hand <em>and</em> turn pages. Simultaneously. Difficult to do with a regular book.</li>
<li>When not in use, fold the cover shut, and drop it in the thinnest pocket of whatever bag you're carrying with you. (You <em>do</em> have a cover for it, right?)</li>
<li><em></em>It weighs less than just about any book you could buy.</li>
<li>It takes up less space than just about any book you could buy.</li>
<li>While it does require charging, I find myself charging it less than once a month. (And I use it a lot.)</li>
<li>You can play games on it, if you're so inclined.</li>
<li>You can have it for $69.</li>
<li>It uses the Amazon bookstore. Amazon is awesome.</li>
<li>It makes reading fun, so you read more than you would otherwise.</li>
<li>It can hold over a thousand books simultaneously, so you can start slimming down your library.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a short list of how I do most of my reading. If you don't have a Kindle yet, look into it. It could change your life.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Dream Big, and Build Optionality</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/07/31/dream-big-and-build-optionality</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all can dream big. I have dreams, and you probably do to.
For example: Travel, location independent living, being wealthy/choosing to do work that interests you, enjoying "simple" things. The list could go on, and on, and on.</p>
<p>But then we go right along doing all the normal things, wishing and wishing, but never taking any action.</p>
<p>I don't want to spend the next ten years of my life wishing for lots and doing nothing - that is one of the reasons I started this blog. I want to do epic stuff, and writing about my progress helps me do that.<!--more--></p>
<p>And then I came across another phenomenon. I wrote down a <a href="/epic-quest" title="My Epic Quest of Awesome">huge list of things I want to do</a> and learn, and I have made progress on many of them. I've experimented with a Dvorak keyboard layout, I'm learning to write in italics, I set aside enough time to <a href="/read-along-with-josh" title="Read Along with Josh">read at least two books a week</a>, I'm learning Krav Maga, and my wife and I are slowly sorting out how to cook.</p>
<p>But here's the problem: None of these things will produce disproportionate rewards. Even if I could type at 150 wpm, write at 55 wpm, read four books a week, cook amazing meals, and was amazing at Krav Maga, I'm no closer to my really big goals. (Travel hacking, having an awesome job, eventual location independence/self-employment, etc.)</p>
<p>I derive significant value from the things I'm learning, and I'd rather invest my time in something that produces returns, rather than spend another hour a day commuting, or watching TV, but right now, my  efforts at self-improvement lack direction.</p>
<p>My attitude has changed as I've read and integrated information from <a href="http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/the-tripod-of-stability/">two</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CC8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAntifragile-Things-That-Gain-Disorder%2Fdp%2F1400067820&amp;ei=LE_5Ub6UN8zE4AON04GoCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNE4XmEtQRlZGKiCKv4qdJTY2uDylg&amp;sig2=KT6p_4Tj9TN3u7jgeJAo7g&amp;bvm=bv.49967636,d.dmg">sources</a>. I am not currently working on specific plans to achieve my strategic goals, because there are so many different ways to those ends, and its pretty foolish to predict what may be happening in six months.</p>
<p>I am currently working on building stability in a few important areas of my life, so I can expose myself to limited risk that could have tremendous payoff.</p>
<ul>
<li>If I can achieve significant financial security, I can experiment more with self-employment, if a good opportunity comes along.</li>
<li>If we can reduce our monthly expenses to just a few hundred dollars (not including rent), Kristi and I can experiment with extended international travel.</li>
<li>If I can build a strong network of professional relationships, I can learn from experts and expose myself to really cool job opportunities.</li>
<li>If I can achieve a fairly high level of fitness, I can enjoy opportunities to by physical, as they arise. (Have you ever run all the way up the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;docid=872fAOzMkt0TrM&amp;tbnid=7kH6HH-1NrxcVM:&amp;ved=&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fcommons.wikimedia.org%2Fwiki%2FFile%3A2008_04_21_-_Bethesda_-_Medical_Center_Metro_Station_2.JPG&amp;ei=JVD5UcjZJLXk4APWsICgDQ&amp;psig=AFQjCNEoza2nDjWsL18oS0PPf-BlYyug3A&amp;ust=1375379877670791">Medical Center metro escalator</a>? I've tried a few times, and last time I went up it, I ran the whole way. It was awesome.)</li>
<li>If I can build a strong, trusting relationship with my wife, we can do hard things without experiencing as much <a href="/blog/2013/07/18/rules-for-fighting-fair" title="Rules for Fighting Fair">relationship stress</a> as we would if it were a weak relationship.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where on this list does <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard">Dvorak typing</a> fit in?</p>
<p>It doesn't.</p>
<p>How about <a href="http://lifehacker.com/how-i-taught-myself-to-code-in-eight-weeks-511615189">learning to code</a>?</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>I want to build<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/anti-fragility.asp"> antifragility </a>into our lifestyle. We're getting there, but have a ways to go yet.</p>
<p>I don't yet know exactly how to make my big goals happen, but I do know I can take steps to be prepared. I cannot let my uncertainty prevent preparation, so right now, we are figuring out how to reduce our possessions, reduce our living expenses, possibly grow our income, and expose ourselves to cool opportunities and relationships. Then, when something amazing comes up, we will be able to jump on it.</p>
<p>How about you? What big dreams do you have? Are you putting yourself in a position to be exposed to these opportunities, and take advantage of them when you encounter one?</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>I'm pretty sure you're a mind reader lately... This post describes my life in the past 2 months.
Moving to Bosnia (and deciding to go back to the U.S.) has been the scariest, craziest, most stressful and awful but also the single most rewarding and revealing experience of my life. After this, I KNOW I can do ANYTHING. Fly the Space Shuttle? Sure, no problem, just give me the flight manual &amp; I'll figure it out!</p>
<p>The point I'm trying to make (not all too well) is that doing scary things will FREE YOU. Right now, I don't care about leaving all my possessions behind. My attachment to "stuff" is gone. Instead of feeling sad and depressed, I am more psyched and excited about life than I've ever been. Moving back is going to be even scarier. We don't have a place to live, no car, no job (me at least), and all we'll have is 2 bags each. TERRIFYING, but I know we'll figure it out somehow. I will eventually find a rewarding job. We will live a spartan, minimalist lifestyle. Hopefully, we'll get to travel too. But at least we'll be ON OUR OWN. Without interference or meddling of any kind. </p>
<p>Maybe we can even start a meet-up once we get back.... In the meantime, all I know is, if anyone can do it, YOU CAN DO IT. Just don't stress about it. You are very similar to Amir (I think, maybe my assessment is wrong) in that you often tie your self-worth to the achievement of goals that sometimes tend to be pretty rigid. RELAX. Don't be so hard on yourself. Sometimes, "letting go" can change your life.... I hope all that made sense....</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>Waking Up Early, Part 3</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/08/02/waking-up-early-part-3</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've written about my attempts to <a href="/blog/2013/05/07/how-to-wake-up-early" title="How to Wake Up Early">wake up early before</a>.</p>
<p>Most recently, I <a href="/blog/2013/07/15/waking-up-early-2-0" title="Waking Up Early 2.0">promised</a> to take a sleep log, to track trends. Fortunately, I did not intend to try to wake up early, because I didn't.</p>
<p>Here's what I learned in the last three weeks:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Benadryl messes with your ability to wake up.</strong> <!--more-->I got poison ivy all over my leg a few weeks ago, and have been taking antihistamines pretty regularly. I'm not sure the Benadryl directly contributed to making it hard to wake up at 5:30, but I can't imagine that it helped.</li>
<li><strong>It is <em>extremely</em> hard to go to bed early.</strong> I spent a week on a family vacation in Rehobeth Beach, Delaware, and I had a great time. I also rarely made it to bed before 12:30a. I would try to get out of bed at 6:30 or 7:00, but couldn't get up until about 8:00, most days. (This is still early in terms of early-20s vacation standards - I did not once sleep in until 9, let alone noon, so I'm counting this as a win. But I'm far from my goal.) Even after my vacation, I still really struggle to get to bed at a good hour.
<p>For example, I am typing this at 10:00 pm. Ideally, by 10:00 pm, I would have not looked at my computer for two hours. Yet here I am. I hope to be in bed in less than an hour, but that still has me not falling asleep until after 11:00 pm. Not good enough.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>I don't need to focus on getting up early anymore. I need to master my bedtime. </strong>I have very real minimum sleep requirements, and it is foolishness to skimp on sleep, and <em>then</em> being my day at 5:00am. I may be getting only six hours of sleep, and by the time the end of my work day rolls around, I would have been going for twelve hours. That math, while not terrible, is not sustainable.</li>
<li><strong>I am a level two sleeper.</strong> I can get up early if I have properly rested. <a href="http://couloircreative.com/">Jeff Chrisler</a> sent me <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/07/31/207319883/want-to-be-a-morning-person-take-a-few-tips-from-campers">this article</a>. It covers how backpackers naturally adapt to being early risers, synching their circadian rhythm with the sun. It's not rocket science, but it helped me realize that <em>there are some who believe it is physically impossible to wake up early, feeling rested, without being a "morning person". </em>Well, I can stand here and confidently say, in the words of the great entrepreneur <a href="http://www.guykawasaki.com/">Guy Kawasaki:</a> "Bull shiitake. It's possible. I did it."
<p>A level one sleeper is one who, in the words of <a href="/">Josh Thompson</a> is "a 'night owl' and cannot comprehend the <em>possibility</em> of being an early riser." This is, to him, not a lack of will power. It's a lack of imagination. Note that there is nothing inherently wrong with being a level one sleeper.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, I didn't move much in the direction I had hoped, these last two weeks, but I did come to some important realizations, and more importantly, I didn't completely waste my time. I'm going to spend the next two weeks recording my time up and my time asleep, and I'll present my findings here to you, my kind, generous, and supremely intelligent readers.</p>
<p>I have a two-part call to action:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you want to be an early(er)-riser, track when you go to bed and when you get up every night for the next two weeks.</li>
<li>If you plan on doing step one, tell me. I'll pester you in a few days to see how you're doing.</li>
</ol>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>20 Things 20-Year-Olds Don't Get</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/08/12/20-things-20-year-olds-dont-get</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jason Nazar recently wrote an article titled <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/29/20-year-olds-dont-get-anything_n_3670651.html">20 Things 20-Year-Olds Don't Get. </a></p><p>Please read it, but with a big grain of salt.</p><p>Nazar opens with the statement "I made a lot of mistakes along the way, and I see this generation making their own."</p><p>This seems to be an aspirational list, rather than scolding, but it sure does feel like scolding.</p><p>I thought I'd give my own feedback, as a member of the "20-somthings club" for four years.</p><p>In Nazar's defense, he has two challenging constraints - brevity and clicks. He covers a lot of ground in just a few words, and his article is posted to generate clicks, not necessarily to deliver nuanced perspective to the reader.</p><p>Here we go.&nbsp;<em>Italicized words are mine:<!--more--></em></p><p>1. Time is Not a Limitless Commodity – I so rarely find young professionals that have a <a target="_hplink" href="http://premium.docstoc.com/c/46/ch/236/l/1163/Urgency-and-Momentum">heightened sense of urgency</a>&nbsp;to get to the next level. In our 20s we think we have all the time in the world to A) figure it out and B) get what we want. Time is the only treasure we start off with in abundance, and can never get back. Make the most of the opportunities you have today, because there will be a time when you have no more of it.</p><p><em>Partially right - time is the most important resource, and can be easily wasted or squandered on dumb things, like obsessing over achieving "the next level" in your career. No one has said on their death bed "I wish I spent more time at work." Time is valuable, and must not be wasted, but all your time should not be spent on your career; you'll be worse at your job, bad at relationships, and have nothing to remember about your life but disliking your commute.</em></p><p><strong>2. You’re Talented, But Talent is Overrated</strong>&nbsp;- Congratulations, you may be the most capable, creative, knowledgeable &amp; multi-tasking generation yet. As my father says, “I’ll Give You a Sh-t Medal.” Unrefined raw materials (no matter how valuable) are simply wasted potential. There’s no prize for talent, just results. Even the most seemingly gifted folks methodically and painfully worked their way to success. (Tip: read “<a target="_hplink" href="http://www.amazon.com/Talent-Overrated-World-Class-Performers-EverybodyElse/dp/1591842948">Talent is Overrated</a>”)</p><p><em>Nazar is 100% right - but for most people, they've grown up in a school system that relentlessly rewards existence, not results. It is not fulfilling to be rewarded for existing - people are fulfilled when doing meaningful work, and a lot of young folks have been kneecapped by being told (usually be an older generation) that "they have what it takes" and "everyone is unique". This disconnect from producing hurts everyone. </em></p><p><strong>3. We’re More Productive in the Morning</strong>&nbsp;– During my first 2 years at Docstoc (while I was still in my 20’s) I prided myself on staying at the office until 3am on a regular basis. I thought I got so much work done in those hours long after everyone else was gone. But in retrospect I got more menial, task-based items done, not the more complicated strategic planning, phone calls or meetings that needed to happen during business hours. Now I stress an office-wide early start time because I know, for the most part,&nbsp;<a target="_hplink" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/successful-early-risers-2012-1?op=1">we’re more productive</a>&nbsp;as a team in those early hours of the day.</p><p><em>Again, 100% right, but he belies his priorities - what's the problem with working until 3am? It's not just a <strong>productivity</strong> issue, it is a <strong>priority</strong> issue. I love mornings, and usually get up before 6am to do the "complicated strategic planning" things I need to do for my life. I once worked 90 hours a week for a business - not only did my work quality suffer, I abdicated all sense of priority in my life to my employer. I will never do this again - I have a wife, and a life.</em></p><p><strong>4. Social Media is Not a Career</strong>&nbsp;– These job titles won’t exist in 5 years. Social media is simply a function of marketing; it helps support branding, ROI or both. Social media is a means to get more awareness, more users or more revenue. It’s not an end in itself. I’d strongly caution against pegging your career trajectory solely to a <a target="_hplink" href="http://memeburn.com/2013/05/21-ridiculous-social-media-job-titles/">social media job title</a>.</p><p><em>20-somethings are not the only ones guilty of this. Also, since we were just talking about delivering results (and therefore value) if you can deliver value to a business via social media, get to it. I've come across dozens of small businesses that have no Facebook page, or any other web presence. You'll never get paid to just tweet for a company, but if you can help them enter the arena in which most of their potential customers do business, you're growing their bottom line. </em></p><p><strong>5. Pick Up the Phone</strong>&nbsp;– Stop hiding behind your computer. Business gets done on the phone and in person. It should be your first instinct, not last, to talk to a real person and source business opportunities. And when the Internet goes down… stop looking so befuddled and don’t ask to go home. Don’t be a pansy, pick up the phone.</p><p><em>I have nothing to add to this. He hits it on the head. You can connect with people over the phone in a way you cannot in an email. Since business is about relationships, you should figure out how to build relationships. Relationships can be built over the phone. They are hard to build over email.</em></p><p><strong>6. Be the First In &amp; Last to Leave</strong>&nbsp;­– I give this advice to everyone starting a new job or still in the formative stages of their professional career. You have more ground to make up than everyone else around you, and you do have something to prove. There’s only one sure-fire way to get ahead, and that’s to work harder than all of your peers.</p><p><em>This is wrong, and it is t<strong>he most damaging item on the list</strong>. Again, we have been talking about adding <strong>value</strong> to a business. If you can add 3 units of value/hour to a company for 10 hours a day, or add 6 units of value/hour for 8 hours a day, which is better for your company? That is 30 units of value vs. 48 units of value. Excuse my arbitrary measuring, but the emphasis is not </em><em>"work longer", it's work smarter. Obviously, don't slack off, but don't hand your soul over to your business. Work hard at meaningful work. Simple as that.</em></p><p><strong>7. Don’t Wait to Be Told What to Do</strong>&nbsp;– You can’t have a sense of entitlement without a sense of responsibility. You’ll never get ahead by waiting for someone to tell you what to do. Saying “nobody asked me to do this” is a guaranteed recipe for failure. Err on the side of doing too much, not too little. (Watch:&nbsp;<a target="_hplink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz0o9clVQu8">Millennials in the Workplace Training Video</a>)</p><p><em>You should never have a sense of entitlement, even if you have a sense of responsibility. Yes, do too much rather than too little. If you watch that video and find it anything but condescending and not that funny, you can probably stop reading now. </em></p><p><strong>8. Take Responsibility for Your Mistakes</strong>&nbsp;– You should be <a target="_hplink" href="http://premium.docstoc.com/c/38/ch/191/l/1015/Repeat-Own-then-Make-New-Mistakes">making lots of mistakes </a>when you’re early on in your career. But you shouldn’t be defensive about errors in judgment or execution. Stop trying to justify your F-ups. You’re only going to grow by embracing the lessons learned from your mistakes, and committing to learn from those experiences.</p><p><em>Agreed. This holds true for all ages, and <strong>not taking responsibility for mistakes</strong> afflicts everyone, regardless of age. Be someone who takes responsibility, not someone who avoids it.</em></p><p><strong>9. You Should Be Getting Your Butt Kicked</strong>&nbsp;– Meryl Streep in “The Devil Wears Prada” would be the most valuable boss you could possibly have. This is the most impressionable, malleable and formative stage of your professional career. Working for someone that demands excellence and <a target="_hplink" href="http://premium.docstoc.com/c/38/ch/191/l/1019/Kaizen---Improve-Everyday">pushes your limits every day</a>&nbsp;will build the most solid foundation for your ongoing professional success.</p><p><em>He's wrong. You should be growing, but Streep would be a terrible boss. If her direct reports (terrible word) manage her staff the same way she manages them, it'll turn the entire company into picking on everyone one rung down the ladder. That's toxic to the success of a company. If Nazar is down with this management style, I feel sorry for his staff.</em></p><p><strong>10. A New Job a Year Isn’t a Good Thing</strong>&nbsp;­­– 1-year stints don’t tell me that you’re so talented that you keep outgrowing your company. It tells me that you don’t have the discipline to see your own learning curve through to completion. It takes about 2-3 years to master any new critical skill, give yourself at least that much time before you jump ship. Otherwise your resume reads as a series of <a target="_hplink" href="http://premium.docstoc.com/c/23/ch/80/l/328/Red-Flags-to-Look-Out-For">red flags on why not to be hired</a>.</p><p><em>I am confident that Nazar hires the best employees he can, and I bet even he has broken this implicit rule when hiring. Since a business is (or should be) interested in delivering value, if a candidate has moved around every year or so, but delivers value and understands the implications of that rapid movement, there shouldn't be any concerns.</em></p><p><strong>11. People Matter More Than Perks</strong>&nbsp;– It’s so trendy to pick the company that offers the most flex time, unlimited meals, company massages, game rooms and team outings. Those should all matter, but not as much as the character of your founders and managers. Great leaders will mentor you and will be a loyal source of employment long after you’ve left.&nbsp;<a target="_hplink" href="http://scottberkun.com/2013/pick-your-own-boss/">Make a conscious bet</a>&nbsp;on the folks you’re going to work for and your commitment to them will pay off much more than those fluffy perks.</p><p><em>Good people will take care of their staff, and provide appropriate "fluffy perks" when it matters to staff. Staff deliver value, happy staff deliver more value. Take care of your staff. </em></p><p><strong>12. Map Effort to Your Professional Gain</strong>&nbsp;– You’re going to be asked to do things you don’t like to do. Keep your eye on the prize. Connect what you’re doing today, with where you want to be tomorrow. That should be all the incentive you need. If you can’t map your future success to your current responsibilities, then it’s time to <a target="_hplink" href="http://lifehacker.com/5948908/how-to-know-when-its-time-to-quit">find a new opportunity</a>.</p><p><em>Yes. But don't be a pushover. Don't do 90 hour weeks. Work harder than your coworkers, and deliver more value, but don't be a pushover. Life is too short to spend three years sucking up s**t work for a jerk of a manager - and doing this will change who you are. You will <strong>become</strong> one who does that which you do not want to do. Draw the line.</em></p><p><strong>13. Speak Up, Not Out</strong>&nbsp;– We’re raising a generation of sh-t talkers. In your workplace this is a cancer. If you have issues with management, culture or your role &amp; responsibilities, SPEAK UP. Don’t take those complaints and trash-talk the company or co-workers on lunch breaks and anonymous chat boards. If you can <a target="_hplink" href="http://premium.docstoc.com/video/102271314/How-to-Address-Problems-in-the-Workplace">effectively communicate what needs to be improved</a>, you have the ability to shape your surroundings and professional destiny.</p><p><em>Conflict is inherent in relationships, and conflict management/resolution/however you want to label it is possibly the most valuable skill you can have. As you learn to get stuff done and deliver value, you will inevitably run the risk of stepping on toes. You can either complain about the stick-in-the-mud that can't handle your amazing money-making ideas, or you can figure out how to work within the framework of your business to make change happen. There are people that do this all day for the government, so if you work in the private sector, it's totally possible. If it's still not possible to make change happen, leave your job. </em></p><p><strong>14. You HAVE to Build Your Technical Chops</strong>&nbsp;– Adding “Proficient in Microsoft Office” at the bottom of your resume under Skills, is not going to cut it anymore. I immediately give preference to candidates who are ninjas in: Photoshop, HTML/CSS, iOS, WordPress, Adwords, MySQL, Balsamiq, advanced Excel, Final Cut Pro – regardless of their job position. If you plan to stay gainfully employed, you better complement that humanities degree with some applicable <a target="_hplink" href="http://premium.docstoc.com/article/154782656/Online-Courses-for-Small-Businesses">technical chops</a>.</p><p><em>True. Learn to <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">code</a>, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">design</a>, or <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">whatever</a>. </em><em>Learn things. If you don't have time to learn things, make time. </em></p><p><strong>15. Both the Size and Quality of Your Network Matter</strong>&nbsp;– It’s who you know more than what you know, that gets you ahead in business. Knowing a small group of folks very well, or a huge smattering of contacts superficially, just won’t cut it. Meet and stay connected to lots of folks, and invest your time developing as many of those relationships as possible. (TIP: Here is my <a target="_hplink" href="http://www.jasonnazar.com/2010/06/29/networking-tips-for-entrepreneurs/">Networking Advice</a>)</p><p><em>It's not just "networking", but it's "relationship building". Unless you know everything there is to know about anything you'd like to know about, you stand to benefit from building relationships. As you build these relationships, deliver value. Sometimes (especially if you're young) the experience and knowledge ratio is so one-sided the only thing you can deliver is a heart-felt "thank you for your wisdom, and your time." This counts as delivering value, so get out there and meet people. Learn from them. </em></p><p><strong>16. You Need At Least 3 Professional Mentors</strong>&nbsp;– The most guaranteed path to success is to emulate those who’ve achieved what you seek. You should always have at least 3 people you call mentors who are where you want to be. Their free guidance and counsel will be the most priceless gift you can receive. (TIP: “<a target="_hplink" href="http://blogs.wsj.com/accelerators/2013/05/24/jason-nazar-the-secret-to-getting-and-keeping-mentors/">The Secret to Finding and Keeping Mentors</a>”)</p><p><em>If you don't yet have mentors, just go meet professionals and experts. Even a mortician (if they are really good at what they do) has a lot to tell you about building a business, empathizing with customers, and mastering a craft. If you can't see past the dead people, you probably are not ready for a professional mentor anyway.</em></p><p><strong>17. Pick an Idol &amp; Act “As If”</strong>&nbsp;– You may not know what to do, but your professional idol does. I often coach my employees to pick the businessperson they most admire, and act “as if.” If you were (fill in the blank) how would he or she carry themselves, make decisions, organize his/her day, accomplish goals? You’ve got to fake it until you make it, so it’s better to fake it as the most accomplished person you could imagine. (Shout out to <a target="_hplink" href="https://twitter.com/tonyrobbins">Tony Robbins</a>&nbsp;for the tip)</p><p><em>Again, yes. <a href="/blog/2013/07/25/my-good-friends-who-dont-know-me">Have mentors, friends, and role models</a>. It's OK if they are imaginary.</em></p><p><strong>18. Read More Books, Fewer Tweets/Texts</strong>&nbsp;– Your generation consumes information in headlines and 140 characters: all breadth and no depth. Creativity, thoughtfulness and thinking skills are freed when you’re forced to read a full book cover to cover. All the keys to your future success, lay in the past experience of others. Make sure to <a target="_hplink" href="http://www.goodreads.com/">read a book a month</a>&nbsp;(fiction or non-fiction) and your career will blossom.</p><p><em>He speaks truth. If you like what you read here, <a href="/read-along-with-josh">you may enjoy these books.</a></em></p><p><strong>19. Spend 25% Less Than You Make</strong>&nbsp;– When your material needs meet or exceed your income, you’re sabotaging your ability to really make it big. Don’t shackle yourself with golden handcuffs (a fancy car or an expensive apartment). Be willing and able to take 20% less in the short term, if it could mean 200% more earning potential. You’re nothing more than penny wise and pound-foolish if you pass up an amazing new career opportunity to keep an extra little bit of income. No matter how much money you make, spend 25% less to support your life. It’s a guaranteed formula to be less stressed and to always have the flexibility to pursue your dreams.</p><p><em>The last four points are worth this entire article. Even the dumb stuff is far outweighed by these items. Please apply these to your life, starting today. Read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Will-Teach-You-To-Rich/dp/0761147489">I Will Teach You To Be Rich</a> to get started.</em></p><p><strong>20. Your Reputation is Priceless, Don’t Damage It</strong>&nbsp;– Over time, your reputation is the most valuable currency you have in business. It’s the invisible key that either opens or closes doors of professional opportunity. Especially in an age where everything is forever recorded and accessible,&nbsp;<a target="_hplink" href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/w/warrenbuff108887.html">your reputation has to be guarded</a>&nbsp;like the most sacred treasure. It’s the one item that, once lost, you can never get back.</p><p><em>Rather than treating your reputation as a finite, delicate item like fine china, get out there and make honorable choices with courage. If you always try to do the right thing, care for others (especially if they are "below" you), and focus on serving customers and staff, you will not be damaging your reputation, you'll be improving it. If you are one to cheat, steal, and beg, maybe you should keep that on the DL, but it's not exactly a sustainable lifestyle. </em></p><p><em>There was useful stuff in this article, but I wanted to add my two cents. Thanks for reading, and let me know if you agree or disagree. I'm open to it all!</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Quite a long entry Mr. Thompson.  I am wondering whether you or Mr. Nazar is more absolute in your positions.  As some on on the other side of the curve, I can assure you that your perspective may change as you experience more of life.  I would bore even myself if I addressed each of the above points however, as an example, your statement that no one has said on their death bed, "I wish I had spent more time at work," is a phrase that I have heard for decades and isn't exactly accurate.  As I meet and learn from more people in there 80's and 90"s, I find that many of them, both men and women, wish that they had spent more time at work.  The happiest and most vital are those that continue working until their 70's 80's and even 90's.  I have observed this in people with menial jobs and also in highly trained and skilled workers.   They did not so much did what they enjoyed but rather enjoyed what they did (yep that is a tough sentence to read the first time).. Trust me on this, we are wired to work..   I love the opportunity go to the Old Testament.  It has some really good rules to live by. . I suggest .Ecclesiastes 5:18-20  It is quite a bit briefer than Nazar.  I hope that it clicks.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>I completely agree with your sentiments here Josh- solid post.  I read through the list and really felt like he almost ruined with with "Be the first in and last to leave."  This is the opposite of what he should be teaching his young workers.  They should be working smart and hard, but not for lengthy periods of time when many times working over 9 or 10 hours will simply mean that your output goes right down the drain and you are less fired up to get in the next day.  I would add one more thing to this list- don't be afraid to ask a question or for something.  In college I was always annoyed at the people who asked questions because most of the time I got the material.  It's not just about getting it, but it's also about making yourself known.  Of course, don't ask a silly question.  Also, I always felt like certain people got what they wanted and I started to notice why... they simply asked for it.  In the past few years, I have asked to do this or that at my job and I have for the most part gotten what I wanted.  In my 20s, I would have been too afraid to ask, but as the old saying goes, what's the worst they could say... no?  Plus, a no isn't always a bad thing;  asking for something as small or large as it may be can also garner respect.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Thanks for the feedback Jeff - it's interesting you mention "asking for things". I think you're right on, there - asking for things is actually a great way to go, as long as it's reasonable and you're not entitled. I've been working on that for myself lately, and I've had great success (Free upgrades to exit rows on planes, for example). 
And yeah - never be first-in, first-out. If that is the attitude of the company someone works for, they need to get out ASAP. It will suck their soul.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>On Feedback</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/08/15/on-feedback</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of what makes us who we are is based on some sort of feedback obtained earlier in our life.
By my best estimation, there are two types of feedback:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Explicit feedback</strong>, which comes in a little box labeled "this is feedback", and is hard to miss.</li>
<li><strong>Implicit feedback</strong>, which is unlabeled, and but for your attention to it, goes unnoticed.</li>
</ol>
<p>By my age (mid-20s) most of my life has been guided by explicit feedback. As a baby, I was rewarded for doing things like crawling and disciplined when I tried to lick power outlets; as a young child I was rewarded for doing what I was told to do, and disciplined when I didn't. As a student, I was rewarded with good grades when I did what I was told ("Learn this material in such a fashion that you can regurgitate it on a test with unique but similarly structured questions.") or when I synthesized old ideas in old ways ("Make an assertion, defend it using intelligible thought and a passing understanding of the English language. No less than twelve pages.")</p>
<p><strong>Jobs come laden with explicit feedback.</strong> Being given a job usually comes with explicit feedback: "we are happy to bring you on board because of X, Y, and Z, and we think you're a good fit for the role." Ditto with raises, promotions, and "employee of the month" awards. More explicit feedback is available in the form of reprimands, and of course, being fired.</p>
<p><strong>Relationships have explicit feedback.</strong> Someone verbally agreeing to be your friend or (in the case of my wife) agreeing to marry me is providing explicit. When they say "I hate it when [x]" or "I love [Y]", this is explicit feedback. They are verbalizing their feelings.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about all this, though, is<strong> </strong>this: <strong>implicit feedback can lead to so much growth. </strong>So much more growth than explicit feedback. If you are sensitive to others around you and have a sincere desire to learn, you can figure out how to kick butt at work, or in a relationship, or a lot of other things. Implicit feedback allows you to <em>infer</em> what is going on under the surface.</p>
<p>There are a lot of areas this applies to. Relationships, jobs, friendships, self-monitoring... I've hardly thought of them all.</p>
<p>If you apply this method to all areas of your life, I think the results could be quite interesting. This is an idea that has been rolling around in my head for a few days, and I want to keep fleshing out. There are some specific situations that this applies to me, and I'll talk more about that soon.</p>
<p>Your feedback is welcome! (pah. of course it is.): In what areas do you wish you had more feedback in? In those areas, could you possibly be more attuned to implicit feedback?</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Feedback pt. 2</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/08/23/feedback-pt-2</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Traditional Feedback is Explicit</h3>
<p>Feedback is the means by which any system makes changes. From the gene pool to the swimming pool, feedback works to eliminate the insufficient and improve the sufficient. (See what I did with the "pool" thing?)</p>
<p>Your car gives you feedback if the oil is running low - this allows you to take corrective action before ruining your action. Your computer gives you feedback if its running hot - this allows you to save your work before your computer automatically shuts down, to cool off. Just about any system that can break has feedback mechanisms built in, so the user can evaluate the individual components of that system <em>before</em> the effect of poor performance ruins the whole thing.</p>
<p>Coaches and teachers give feedback, too. If your not throwing the ball right, or moving in exactly the right way, a good coach will give you feedback so you can improve. If your paper is not shaping up as it should, your teacher will give you feedback.</p>
<p>Here's the problem - in each of these examples, there is a <em>built-in</em> system for feedback. If your car says the oil is low, or your gas is running out, you don't get angry and stomp off. If your coach tells you how to do a specific move better, you (hopefully) don't take it as a personal dig.</p>
<h3>When It Is Not Explicit</h3>
<p>In most areas of life, however, feedback is not <em>built it</em>. It just happens, if you happen to be looking for it or not. Users complaining about a problem (real or perceived) constitute feedback, even though they didn't fill out a survey. If everyone you are talking to ends up leaving the conversation, they are giving you feedback, even though they'll never tell you why they're leaving.</p>
<p>These subtle forms of feedback are extremely valuable, and if you are attentive, you can learn a lot about how people relate to you, your product, and your ideas. <em>I am not advocating reshaping yourself based on the subtle indicators of</em><em> others</em>, but you would be wise to be aware of the messages that are being sent. You can then pick and choose which to be attentive to.</p>
<p>Here are three areas where I'm trying to wrap my head around explicit vs. implicit feedback:</p>
<ul>
<li>At my job, I talk with the users of our product regularly. They usually get in touch with us only when they are confused or their expectations have not been met. I could pass this off as user "confusion" or "user being disconnected from reality", or I can think "their reaction is because <em>something</em> is not being communicated as it should be. Let me figure out what that is."</li>
<li>I am intentional about trying to meet with people that I respect, so I can learn from them. Sometimes these attempts do not pan out - I could either dismiss the unsuccessful attempts as "he's being a jerk" or "he must be really really busy", or, I can think "Someone could figure out how to get in touch with this guy - what does that person know that I do not? How can I learn that too?'</li>
<li>Here is a reversal of implicit vs. explicit feedback: My wife is a source of tremendous joy to me. Her favorite things are different than my favorite things, however. She feels very loved if, as we're driving somewhere far away, I pull over and make a spontaneous date out of a meal, rather than eating in the car. Whenever we've done this, she tells me in very plain words "This makes me feel loved. Thank you." No matter how well I know this, I still regularly try to trick myself into thinking she doesn't care that much, so we'll just grab food while driving.
In this last instance, I try to make explicit feedback ("This makes me feel loved") into implicit feedback ("That was fun") and then dismiss it. Not something I'm proud of, but its what I do, in order to get my way.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is my thoughts on feedback. There is a lot of growth that can happen quickly if you pay attention to how things are received, and adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>Get at it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Things You Can't Do from Behind a Computer, pt. 1</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/08/20/things-you-cant-do-from-behind-a-computer-pt-1</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Meet people.</h2>
<p>Over the last nine or ten months, I can clearly remember a handful of conversations I had. I initiated each conversation with someone that I wanted to learn from. Most I had some prior relationship with (I.E. I had met them, or I knew someone who knew them). This was all precipitated by a <a href="http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/video-how-to-use-natural-networking-to-connect-with-anyone/">useful and provoking post by Ramit Sethi.<!--more--></a></p>
<p>These conversations were not social events, although in each conversation I have enjoyed myself. Each meeting was an opportunity for me to learn more about how these people have done what they have done. I framed them in my mind as "informational interviews". In other words<em>, I interviewed them.</em></p>
<p>I've met with a company-leading salesman, two business consultants employed by one of the "big three" consultancies, a freelancer who runs a very successful production studio, a CEO, a CMO/Marketing Director, a UX designer, another UX designer/web developer, a senior project manager in the banking industry, and a lawyer. In every instance I asked similar questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What challenges have you faced, first in your career, and second on your job, in the last few months.</li>
<li>How has your career developed, and led you to this place.</li>
<li>How did you achieve X (x=prior mentioned achievement, or something on their LinkedIn profile - yeah, I stalk.)</li>
<li>What is the most enjoyable part of your day/job?</li>
<li>Where do you see your self in two or three years?</li>
</ul>
<p>I ask more questions. I always ask for just fifteen or twenty minutes, and I stick to whatever time limit I've set, unless they want to go longer. Half of these conversations have been over the phone, the other half face-to-face. I have derived so much value from these conversations. They have contained plenty of career advice, actionable suggestions, and encouragement.</p>
<p>Here's a few gems that have been consistent across all of these "informational interviews":</p>
<ul>
<li>Career growth is not sexy - spend time cultivating useful skills, and then spend time figuring out <em>how</em> to use those skills in a way that can benefit your company or your career.</li>
<li>Get out and meet people and learn from them.</li>
<li>Learn to solve problems for others, <em>but be sure to communicate this in a way that makes sense to them.</em></li>
<li>Sometimes the best option is to quit a specific job ASAP.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of these informational interviews is <em>not</em> self-promotion or trying to get hired. I think this is the quickest way to ruin a conversation, and, oh yeah - COMPLETELY MISSES THE POINT OF AN INFORMATIONAL INTERVIEW!</p>
<p>Finally, here is how I benefited, and why you can never possibly achieve the same benefit until you get out there and do the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>Now, when meeting with <em>anyone</em> (stranger at a BBQ, long-lost family members, friends) I try to guide the conversation with two ideas in mind: How can I learn more about them, and what wisdom might they have to share. Believe me - this makes more a much more interesting conversation than weather and football.</li>
<li>I am getting better and better at engaging in mature conversation with competent people. <em>This is a skill that can compensate for lack of technical depth, and can open up doors that otherwise would not be open. </em></li>
<li>I am able to hear very specific bits of advice and wisdom, consider how to apply it to my own life, then immediately ask if my interpretation is correct.</li>
<li>I am getting better at reading subtle indicators of how a conversation is going. (Hint - you should know when to end a conversation, and it should be <em>before</em> the other person is thinking about ending the conversation.)</li>
<li>I've had a number of job offers/offers to connect me with people who are hiring.</li>
<li>I still sometimes get indescribably nervous, and can feel my chest tighten and it feels like my voice must be shaking and I'm about to fall over. Insane, and embarrassing. I'm working on it. This happens sometimes in other situations and is intriguing. The more time I spend "there", the more I'll be able to handle it.</li>
<li>I have decided very concretely a few career options that I certainly do <em>not</em> want to pursue. (Consultant with Deloitte? What was once a dream now sounds like hell. No thanks.) The time savings <em>alone</em> of not wasting hours or days (or months, years, and thousands of dollars) are incalculable.</li>
</ul>
<p><em></em>You don't need impressive networking skills to set up a meeting. Here is the FIRST email I sent out, asking to meet up with someone:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Hey R,  </em></p>
<div><em>This is Josh, from [company where I had met R]. N, a friend there, recently gave me your contact information and said I should get in touch with you. </em></div>
<div><em> </em></div>
<div><em>I would love to take advantage of your offer to get in touch with you by chatting with you for fifteen or twenty minutes about the work that you do with [company], what led you to work with them, and what has led you to stick with them. </em></div>
<div><em> </em></div>
<div><em>I will, of course, work around your schedule for a time to meet. If it is convenient  I would love to buy you a cup of coffee at a location and time of your choosing. </em></div>
<div><em> </em></div>
<div><em>Are you willing to set up a short meeting?</em></div>
<div><em> </em></div>
<div><em>Thanks for your time!</em></div>
</blockquote>
<p>Short, sweet, and it was so scary to send. This was what I sent, redundancies and all. I guess I should get a copy editor. The conversation I had with R was extremely helpful, encouraging, and still impacts me today. That was the first.</p>
<p>If you're not sure what you want to do with your life, go start talking to people. I did not even know that User Experience and Design was a thing. I found out about it after some informational interviews and reading some books.</p>
<p>This is all I have for now, but please - take a step. Write down a list of three people you'd like to learn from. Make it happen. They'll be flattered. Wouldn't you be?</p>]]></content:encoded>

Sounds like you've been reading (and applying) Dale Carnegie's "How to win friends and influence people". :) Once you show genuine interest and ask others to share their life experience with you, you'd be surprised how much they open up and LIGHT UP. It's a basic human need - to share of ourselves and to be known. I'll definitely try to set up something like this once I'm back...</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

I still do all the same things with people I don't know (it makes the conversation interesting) but in all of these instances, I was nervous before reaching out to the person in question, because they seemed so accomplished and wise. </p>
<p>But - the more I did it, the more I realized they're normal people. And willing to talk with me. It's been great.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>Mentors and Attitude</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/08/28/mentors-and-attitude</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having a mentor is equal parts "having a mentor" and "being one who can be mentored". If I am too thick-headed to evaluate things that someone tells me and figure out how to apply that to my life, both of us are wasting our time.
Having a mentor is life-changing because you have intentionally adopted a teachable disposition. It is a commitment to growth. If you have a conversation with your mentor, and that conversation is live-streamed to a friend who is not interested in getting mentored, but wants to hear what nuggets of wisdom come from that conversation, you will get far more out of the conversation than he, even though you both heard the exact same thing.</p>
<p>I don't have any formal mentoring relationships but there are a few people in my life who consistently share wisdom, insight, and sometimes tell me "That would be a bad way to go about X - how about this other way?"</p>
<p>I am thankful for these relationships, and I have been deeply impacted by them.</p>
<p>Do you have any mentors? If not, why not?</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Content but Restless</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/09/03/content-but-restless</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is tension between being content with what you have, and striving for more.
We have all heard the “serenity prayer”:</p>
<blockquote><p>God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
The courage to change the things I can,
And wisdom to know the difference.</p></blockquote>
<p>This prayer is supposedly common in Alcohol Anonymous and other 12 Step programs. A little farther down in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_Prayer">Wikipedia article</a>, however, the whole prayer (attributed to American theologian <a title="Reinhold Niebuhr" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhold_Niebuhr">Reinhold Niebuhr</a>) is printed, and it is different:</p>
<blockquote><p>God, give me grace to accept with serenity
The things that cannot be changed,
Courage to change the things
Which <strong>should</strong> be changed,
And the Wisdom to distinguish
The one from the other.</p>
<p>Living one day at a time,
Enjoying one moment at a time,
Accepting hardship as a pathway to peace,
Taking, as Jesus did,
This sinful world as it is,
Not as I would have it,
Trusting that You will make all things right,
If I surrender to Your will,
So that I may be reasonably happy in this life,
And supremely happy with You forever in the next.</p></blockquote>
<p>So there is the original. The difference between the original and the shortened version is <strong>deciding what to change</strong>.</p>
<p>If you sat around and changed <em>only</em> the things you could, you’d change easy things, and insignificant things, because changing hard things and meaningful things is hard. It is hard to change things that <em>should</em> be changed, but those are the only changes worth making. And, the original prayer says nothing about changing what you <strong></strong><em>can.</em> It talks about changing what you <em>should.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action is empowering, and it leads to taking more action.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Action implies making things happen.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Making things happen will eventually lead to failure.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There is great hope in taking action, and there are great lessons to be found in failure. You know how every motivational poster ever to be seen in a school talks about how “You have what it takes” and “You are a beautiful and unique snowflake”?</p>
<p>In addition to being so stupid it hurts, these are wrong. They <em>should</em> say:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Get Shit Done – it will make you feel better about yourself.”</li>
<li>“You are not unique. Millions before you have wrestled with your problems. Some have surpassed you, some have fallen far behind. Until you are dead, there is hope for you.”</li>
<li>Take action. Keep going until you fail. Then try again.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not sure where I am going with all this. But please, go do something meaningful. It is the <em>only</em> thing that matters. Money, your job, your hobby, your friends – none of these matter without something meaningful being done with it or through it.</p>
<p>The good news is you can define what is meaningful. Then you have to do it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Books have been written about a fear of failure. I keep somehow thinking that I can figure things out without failing, but alas - I've not been so lucky. I am slowly dipping my toe in the waters, and I'm finding it is not so bad… few failures are totally unrecoverable, and you can do a lot to mitigate the downsides of failure.
I bet even you have met a few failures along the way to success. :) </p>

      <title>Train Hard</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/09/10/train-hard</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When's the last time you participated in a sporting event? (Football, Ultimate Frisbee, rock climbing, running biking, wrestling, whatever)
When's the last time you <em>trained</em> for that activity?</p>
<p>Finally:</p>
<p>When is the last time you trained for that activity <em>with someone else</em>? <!--more--></p>
<p>There are a few levels of engaging in an activity. You can observe, you can participate, and you can make investments to improve in that pursuit. (Think watching YouTube videos of sky diving, paying to skydive, but doing it tandem, and finally pursuing your skydiving license.)</p>
<p>I am learning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krav_Maga">Krav Maga</a> right now. Every week we cover a new topic, and every few months, you have the opportunity to take a test to advance to the next level, or belt. I am right now in level one (watch out, world...) and am looking forward to the test at the end of the month.</p>
<p>I've been getting bored in the classes of late, because I felt like the material was not pushing me from a technical perspective, and I just wasn't working as hard as I wanted to be during the class. I'm a big fan of pushing myself hard and trying hard, but I was often working with partners who did not inspire me to really push myself.</p>
<p>I recently had the chance to train with another level one student who pushed me very, very hard. Inspired by how hard he was making me train, I made him train just as hard. We both acknowledged at the end of class (after I managed to not throw up) that the perceived quality of the class dramatically improved when being paired with a dedicated training partner.</p>
<p>He and I will not always be able to train together, but I have been reminded of the power of <em>being the guy that pushes you to train hard.</em> He pushed me hard, and I had an opportunity to get a lot out of that hour because of it.</p>
<p>This makes me think of training for climbing - I've climbed with a lot of people, and the instances where we have decided to spend the session training hard always feels vastly more productive than a relaxed climbing session. Sometimes I've been the guy that surprised my partner by pushing them way harder than they expected, sometimes my partner forced me to dig deep and train harder than I thought I could.</p>
<p>The take away, however, is this: <strong>don't settle for simple participation</strong>. Drive improvement and change. Most of that improvement and change comes from wanting it. If you are hungry for improvement, that will rub off on your training partner. If it doesn't wear off, get another partner.</p>
<p>Be the guy (or girl) that inspires others to train hard.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>I just wasted twenty five minutes</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/09/12/i-just-wasted-twenty-five-minutes</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever sat down at your computer, intent on knocking out one specific task, then finding yourself wondering how you spent the last 20 minutes, and you <em>still</em> did not finish what you tried to do?
I sat down fifteen minutes ago with an idea about something to write. It wasn't a blog post, but it involved writing. I started writing this thing first a few weeks ago, and have touched on it here and there since then. I planned on doing a lot more tonight.<!--more--></p>
<p>But then I checked Facebook. And read some articles from the <em>excellent</em> <strong></strong>Signals vs. Noise blog. (<a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1619-theres-always-time-to-launch-your-dream">This is a good read</a>, but ironic, sort of) and <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1748-forget-the-resume-kill-on-the-cover-letter">this</a> (especially if you're looking at getting hired somewhere), and <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2671-at-tedxmidwest-jason-explains-why-the-office">watch this</a>, and if you manage people, read <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3461-b-environment-merits-b-effort">these</a> two <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2888-real-time-vs-slow-time-and-a-defense-of-sane-work-hours">articles</a>.</p>
<p>So... I just wasted the time I set apart of doing a quick burst of creative work.</p>
<p>PS I just read <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/11/how_elite_firms.html">this article about super-competitive jobs</a> at top-tier financial and management consulting companies, and had to adjust my title from "I just wasted twenty minutes" to "I just wasted twenty five minutes".</p>
<p>PPS I want to feel guilty, but I'm fighting that. I'm not sure why.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Persistence</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/09/18/persistence</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Persistence. It's worth far more than any finite sum of money. Actually, it's worth more than an unlimited amount of money, because an unlimited amount of money would complicate my life (and probably yours) far more than we can possibly imagine.
Persistence. I keep trying to think some people are born with it, and others (me) didn't. Or I prefer to think that it can be had only if it were shaped properly by my parents from a young age. If that didn't work, it's sure not through lack of trying. (Thanks for not disowning me at 17, mom and dad!).</p>
<p>I can easily start fifteen different projects. Statistically, thirteen of them are crap. Two of them may have weight. I'll make motions to work on both for a little while, and then I give up. I just drop it. I've done it a lot of times. It's not going to stop until I make it stop.</p>
<p>I've spent at least a few hours learning over a dozen different things in the last few months, but have not stuck with many of them. This may be good or it may be bad. I certainly can't tell which of my fifteen ideas are crap, and it would behoove me to drop the bad ones, or I could be demonstrating a lack of persistence and stick-to-it-iveness.</p>
<p>It's refreshing to not be required to all this sorted out. I thought once I graduated college I'd not be wrestling with this stuff.</p>
<p>Hah.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Value Nuggets</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/10/03/1062</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My most recent <a href="/blog/2013/09/18/persistence">blog</a> <a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/5586fe4be4b0278244ce9f01/5586fe9ee4b0278244ceab74/1434910366292/?format=original">posts</a> were a pile of steaming something. I was trying to get something published that week, because I committed myself to doing just that.
And then I felt terrible - all I did was waste people's time. I had wasted my own time, and now I was multiplying the damage many times, by wasting other's time as well.</p>
<p>Never again will I post something that wastes your time. Those of you subscribed via email, or who come in via twitter, I value you. I apologize for pushing out crappy content.</p>
<p>I read a great article called "<a href="http://thinktraffic.net/write-epic-shit">Write Epic S**t!</a>". The premise is simple. If you want to have a blog that people read, produce things worth reading.</p>
<p>To that end, I am evaluating every article I post on if I think it will produce value for those who read it. If I don't think it will, I won't post. I'd rather have zero content for three weeks than six junky articles that help no one.</p>
<p><strong> Today's value producing nugget:</strong></p>
<p>Sweet potatoes. Of the mashed variety.</p>
<p>I <i>love</i> sweet potatoes, but cooking them is a pain. I don't like running my oven in the summer because it heats up our entire apartment, and I don't like chopping and handling every single stick of sweet potato. I want something mass-produced, that scales well.</p>
<p>And I found it. I've had it before, but had never made it myself. Mashed sweet potatoes.</p>
<p>The recipe is easy, and the product is delicious. If you never cook for yourself, this is still worth doing. The recipe calls for three pounds of sweet potatoes - that's one bag worth. This allows you to create a LOT of food with very little effort.</p>
<p>Here's the recipe: <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/rachael-ray/mashed-sweet-potatoes-recipe/index.html">Mashed Sweet Potatoes</a></p>
<p>Use chicken broth if you can and brown sugar if you can. Even if you skip everything else, it will be amazing.</p>
<p>Go forth and be changed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How to fly… like a boss</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/10/07/how-to-fly-like-a-boss</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am in a quest to <a href="/epic-quest" title="My Epic Quest of Awesome">level up my life</a>. Free flights is a big part of this. I've not gotten too many of those yet, but the next best thing is free seat upgrades. I'm not talking about first class - that's beyond me, at the moment. I'm talking about getting stuck in the back of the plane, jammed against someone else, with zero space.
There's plenty of room for improvement.<!--more--></p>
<p>Short of being moved to first class and getting a personal waiter to attend to every creature comfort, you're best option is getting bumped up to an exit row. After seven hours of your knees bumping into the seat in front of you, an extra six inches of leg room would be better than a four course meal.</p>
<p>When you buy your ticket, you can usually choose what seat you want. Except exit row seats. Those cost extra. No one wants to shell out an extra $40 or $100 for that, so you accept the back-seat-middle option, and head to the airport.</p>
<p>Here's how I've managed to upgrade, for free to the exit row (with it's extra leg room, and often no one sitting beside you) on six of the last seven flights I've taken.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Inquire at the ticket counter, if there is one. (The ticket counter will be near your gate, but is <i>not</i> the kiosk sitting beside the gate.)</p>
<p>Be polite. Put yourself in their shoes. Then act like a decent human being. It's not hard.</p>
<p>Here's the script:</p>
<p><em>You: "Hello - is this the right place to ask about a seat upgrade?"</em>
<em> Them: "Yes."</em>
<em> You: "Awesome. I was wondering if there are any exit row seats available on 1107 to Dallas."</em>
<em> Them: "Let me check"… typing… "Yes, there are. You may upgrade for $40 dollars."</em>
<em> You: "OK - thanks for checking. I'm trying to spend as little as possible on this flight, so I'll pass on the upgrade right now, but thanks again for checking."</em></p>
<p>OK - no luck at the ticket counter. This isn't a surprise, because the ticket counter is sort of like upgrading via the website - if they'd charge you on the website, they'll charge you at the ticket counter.</p>
<p><strong> Step 2</strong>: Inquire at the gate-side kiosk. Again, be friendly. Even if the answer is no, you should have still brightened their day a bit.</p>
<p>There are three options here:
1. No seats available. Walk away. The seats are all full, so no dice today.
2. Seats available, but you have to pay. Walk away - there's still hope.
3. Seats available, but the agent has to either let everyone else board, or needs to finalize the roster before giving you the upgrade. Let them know you're interested, give them your ticket if needed, and wait until they call you back up or everyone has boarded.</p>
<p>This last option has been the most common for me. I have to wait a few minutes, or let everyone board, and the ticket agent hands me a new ticket for the exit row. Success!</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Make the switch once you're on the plane. By this point, you should know for sure if there is an exit row seat, and if you asked, you'll know which one. (If it's the middle seat between two people, and you're assigned an isle seat elsewhere on the plane, it may not be worth making the switch.</p>
<p>But if it's a desirable seat, here's what you do…</p>
<p>Take your assigned seat, and wait for everyone to get on the plane. As soon as flight attendants start shutting the overhead compartments, locate one and say "I noticed an open exit row seat. Would you mind if I swapped into that one real quick?"</p>
<p>They will <i>probably</i> say "go for it."</p>
<p>Success! Sitting in an exit row seat, possibly with no one besides you. I'm writing this right now in an exit row seat with an empty seat beside me. It's great, and quite worth while.</p>
<p><strong>Why Bother?</strong></p>
<p>There are two reasons why this is something worth doing:</p>
<p>First, flying is uncomfortable. Any extra room for comfort increases the quality of the hours you'll spend sitting there. This upgrade hurts no one, so why not try for it?</p>
<p>Second, you will start learning to ask for things in a polite but reasonable manner. <a href="http://www.entresting.com/blog/100-days-of-rejection-therapy/">I have suspicions that a <i>lot</i> of things can be had by just asking kindly</a>, so why not start learning to do so?</p>
<p>Please give this a shot next time you take a flight. Let me know how it goes!</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Good tips!I have also learned that a little kindness goes a LONG way in the airport - why?  Because NO ONE is nice to the janitors, the people behind the counters in the food court, the ticket agents, the gate agents or even flight attendants.  Everyone is in a hurry and thinks the world revolves around them.  </p>
<p>I recently was very kind to a ticket agent ("Hi _(insert their name - just look on the name tag)_, looks like you guys sure are busy.  Thanks so much for helping me today.  How are you?" - and then wait until they answer...and then smile while looking them in the eye.) who waived the astronomical "heavy bag" fee because my bag was a few pounds over the limit.  This was an international flight, so the cost could have been HUGE.  The icing on the cake was when the pushy customer behind me had to pay a baggage fee :-)</p>
<p>Also, on another flight, a storm had cancelled ALL flights out of the airport and we were stuck.  After waiting in line for almost 2 hours...yes, 2 hours in the wee hours of the morning, it was finally our turn.  We approached the ticket agent with a smile, praised him for all of his hard work and were very gracious with his "suggestions" of how we could get home (his suggestions were unhelpful, to say the least...but it wasn't his fault all flights had been cancelled.)  We stood out in stark contrast to the customer yelling at the next agent about how they needed to pay for his rental car.  I asked my agent how long he had been at the airport that day, "Almost 24 hours."  WHOA!  As soon as he said this I realized that while I was majorly inconvenienced, this guy really as working his tail off, was more exhausted than I was, and had probably been verbally abused more than anyone else I have ever met over the previous 6 hours dealing with unruly travelers.  The result of my kindness?  He upgraded us on each of our connecting flights home.  I tweeted the airline praising him (by name), to which they responded that he would be rewarded and praised at their next meeting.  The next morning he was at our gate getting the plane ready.  We went out of our way to greet him and he remembered us!  He had gotten a few hours of sleep, but still looked pretty exhausted.  He thanked us for being so patient and wished us a good trip home.  It took us a long time to get home, but we made it, upgraded multiple times in a single day simply because we were kind to this man in the middle of a very stressful situation.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>Redefining Success</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/11/06/redefining-success</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's been pretty quiet around here lately. It's been almost a month since my last entry. I thought about writing something here almost every day, but here is why I didn't:
<strong>I want to produce "content" that is helpful and relevant to those who might read it. </strong>I felt like nothing I had done or experienced in the last few weeks, even if expertly documented, could help anyone. I have a few big projects that will be <em>awesome </em>when they are done, but that requires that 1) I finish them, and 2) they are awesome.</p>
<p>Here's why this is still worth reading: <strong>No one can be a failure for failing to meet a few specific goals, because failing is a necessary component of success. </strong>I have often felt like I have failed. Failures don't have anything interesting to say, right?</p>
<p>I had that attitude that I should pipe up only when I've figured out some cool way to make money on the side, or when I've created this really cool website. (I can't code worth crap, by the way. "Creating a really cool website" is <em>not</em> around the corner.)</p>
<p>I am human, but I want to create this persona that looks like me, <em>but has no weaknesses and makes no mistakes. </em>Fortunately, everyone that knows that this is not true.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>The title of this post reminded me of the title of one of my favorite posts on my site "Redefining Possibility" -- http://joshuaspodek.com/redefining_possibility -- which inspires nearly everyone.
The text reminds me of a passage from one of the most inspiring books I've read, Gimp, by Mark Zupan (http://joshuaspodek.com/?s=zupan), a main character in the also inspiring movie Murderball. You can read the book or watch the movie for context, but it will probably stand on its own anyway.</p>
<p>"Rather than fight an impossible battle, one that was beyond my ability to win, I chose instead to focus on the life that was within my grasp, and that life happened to be in a chair. You can say I was surrendering to my injury, but I chose to look at it another way. I was surrendering to my desire to live a happy, fulfilling life. I found I could now align my expectations with my abilities. Instead of concentrating on what I couldn't do, I tried to focus on how far I had come. When I first arrived in the hospital, I was almost fully paralyzed. Two years later, I could bench two hundred pounds. I could walk close to three-quarters of a mile with my crutches. I had skydived. I had crowd surfed. I had realized that most roadblocks existed only in my mind. But my physical limitations were different. They were real. By accepting them, I wasn't admitting defeat. In fact, I was doing the exact opposite. I was realizing I had done everything in my power to overcome them. And if I related all this back to my old ideas of winning and losing, I guess I was declaring myself a winner once and for all. It had just taken me some time to recognize what victory was going to look like for me."</p>
<p>Damn, still chokes me up.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>Monthly Review: October</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/11/08/monthly-review-october</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is my first monthly review. I'll spend some time fleshing out the why and the how, and then get right to it. If you don't want to read a lot of introspective Josh, stop reading. I use the word "I" dozens of times. Consider yourself warned.
For a long time I have feared life passing me by, and after years have passed, I will be largely the same person that I was years ago. I know my temptation is to be passive, so these reviews are an experiment to encourage me to be proactive.<!--more--></p>
<h2>Categories for Monthly Review (and why they made the list)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>My marriage</strong> (Kristi is more important to me than everything else on this list, and as my marriage is strong, these other projects go well. If my marriage saps my energy, nothing else moves forward. My marriage brings joy. Everything else can make me happy, but not joyful.)</li>
<li><strong>Significant relationships</strong> "Josh, there are two kinds of people in the world. Those who pick up the phone and call people, and those who don't have long-term relationships with their family." - Paraphrase of my uncle, who called me every Thursday while I was in college. I want to build that sort of intentionality into important relationships in my life.</li>
<li><strong>Side projects</strong> Side projects are the most significant method of personal development a person can do, without making it their full-time gig. It is a "safe" way to test ideas, and if any pan out, they can turn into extra forms of income. Money is not, however, the primary goal. This blog is a side project.</li>
<li><strong>My job</strong> My job provides my primary income, and I need to do well at it. I also should figure out how to develop myself as much as possible within the role, but my job is hardly the most important thing in my life. That would be bad for me <em>and</em> my employer.</li>
<li><strong>Physical goals</strong> I enjoy being physically active, and I like improving/learning, so I'm going to always try to have a tangible goal on the horizon. (Right now I'm working on learning handstands, for example.)</li>
<li><strong>Finances </strong>Money is sort of like oxygen. You notice when it's gone, but more than a certain amount and it doesn't do much for you. Kristi and I want to be wise stewards of our resources, and be generous. It is obvious that finances (no matter how much or how little we earn) are important.</li>
<li><strong>Debt reduction (student loans, car loan) </strong>A sub-component of finances. I want to be debt-free, and I want it badly. Since I don't want to reveal tons of details of our finances (I'm not sure why) I will talk about debt reduction as a decimal based off of payments made:minimum payments. If we <em>have</em> to make a $100 payment, and do so, we are 1:1 on debt for the month. If we make a $200 payment on a $100 minimum payment, we're 2:1 on debt, or 2.0. The higher the number the better. As we reduce our debt, we should be able to sustain higher and higher numbers.</li>
<li><strong>My monthly reviews</strong> I've never done a monthly review before. I need to make them effective, so I'll always reflect on the quality and utility of the review.</li>
<li><strong>Habits</strong> Habits are the way we live at least 95% of our life. It's foolishness to try to make big changes to your life without looking at your habits. I want to make big changes, so I'm monitoring my habits.</li>
<li><strong>Significant events </strong>Sometimes big things happen. I don't want to live my life from big event to big event, but I'm not going to skip over it either.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How do I remember my month?</h2>
<p>Since I don't remember my day-to-day very well, I will rely upon pretty regular entries in <a href="http://750words.com/">750words.com</a>. It's a tool that simply encourages you to write 750 words a day. I don't always write every day, but for the last two weeks, I've missed only a few days. It's an accurate snapshot of my day.</p>
<p>I plan projects (sometimes) in a physical journal, and will refer to that as well.</p>
<h2>October Review</h2>
<p><strong>My marriage</strong> Kristi and I did well. Few memorable disagreements, and we handled those while still being loving to each other. (<a href="/blog/2013/07/18/rules-for-fighting-fair" title="Rules for Fighting Fair">Conflict management is a key quality indicator</a>, remember?)</p>
<p>Our relationship is so much more than just not arguing, though. She felt like I delighted in her, and we did a lot of things together. Kristi's picked up running, as she's training for a five mile race in a few weeks. We went to Krav Maga together at least once a week. We went on dates. All-in-all, we have enjoyed each other and are growing together. I am blessed to be married to her.
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Side Projects</strong> Lots of progress here, but I have too many, which allows me to follow one side project until it gets hard, then I'll jump to another project until THAT gets hard, then move to another one. I "consulted" a few times with the Krav Maga DC Training Center (it's ongoing) and I'm working on tools to help people learn to belay, and deal with fear in lead belaying. I want to keep my projects to just those.</p>
<p><strong>Significant relationships </strong>I made almost zero attempts to reach out to those important to me. There is infinite room for improvement here. Stay tuned for November's review, where I will have progress to report.
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>My job</strong> I have learned my roll just fine, and I've been able to teach a lot of what we do to two newly-hired staff. I had lunch with one of them, and really enjoyed building that relationship. There's room for improvement, though. I struggle with feeling content when it feels like key elements of my job are completely out of my control. Stay tuned.
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Physical goals </strong>I went to the New River Gorge for a weekend, and while I have lost a lot of strength, I managed to send Toxic Hueco (11d), and was pretty happy about that, since I've not trained or done a pull-up almost since June.</p>
<p>I have started learning handstands. I can hold a handstand against a wall for a minute and a half, and I can do little mini-pushups. I want to do a free-standing handstand pushup. So far, I have to build a lot of strength, but I'm ready to take the next steps. I need to learn how to fall out of a handstand, so I can get away from the wall.
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Finances </strong>More money went out this month than came in, because I put a fair chunk of change into paying off our car loan.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Debt reduction (student loans, car loan)</strong></strong> 3.5 (ratio of debt paid off:minimum payment) This is a great number. Definitely not going to happen this month.
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>My monthly reviews </strong>This is my first review. It's been helpful so far. Probably tons of room for improvement, but I'm not concerned.</p>
<p><strong>Habits </strong>I've been using 750words regularly. It's helpful in me planning my day. I've done ~5 minutes of hand-stand training every day. I have been in Krav Maga twice a week, but I'd like to get that up to three times most weeks.</p>
<p>I am trying to get back into using my "hangboard" door frame, but have not systematized that yet. This coming month we'll see improvement, I hope.</p>
<p>I've not been able to reliably wake up early (before 6:00), especially after Krav Maga in the evenings. I'm still experimenting with how to firm up my morning routine.</p>
<p><strong>Significant events </strong>Nothing major here. A few minor things that caused me great elation followed by disappointment, so the lesson learned is either 1) be wary of false expectations or 2) don't get so excited and disappointed. I don't like squashing my emotions, though, so this is not a good option.</p>
<h3>Summary, and going forward</h3>
<p>October was a good month, but not very intentional. Everything I did just sort of happened. I really want to make progress with building intentional relationships with my family (by calling them. Hi Mom!) and I want to drill down my focus on building the climbing-related tools. More on that later.</p>
<p>And here ends my first monthly review, only a week after the end of the month. This has been a useful tool, just writing and categorizing and thinking hard about my month. This makes it easier to make good choices going forward, knowing that I'll be analyzing my decisions in three weeks. If any of you are thinking about doing a similar review, I strongly recommend it!</p>

      <title>Processes Vs. Goals (or, Systems vs. Accomplishments)</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/11/14/processes-vs-goals-or-systems-vs-accomplishments</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this <a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/why-having-no-goals-in-our-lives-might-make-us-happier-and-more-successful">excellent article on systems vs. goals</a>, James argues that even if you did not pursue any specific goals, with the right <em>system</em>, you will still go a long way.
This idea has been floating around my head for over a year, now, and I think it's slowly coalescing into something useful.</p>
<h2>Ten Lessons About Systems</h2>
<ol>
<li>Systems are awfully close to habits.</li>
<li>If you can modify, create, and eliminate habits, you can build any sort of system you'd like. (Start this process here: http://tinyhabits.com/)</li>
<li>Reading about things is <em>completely different</em> than doing things. They don't even belong on the same continuum.</li>
<li>Reading about things is still a great way to learn and shape your character.</li>
<li>A goal of "habit change" fails to meet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria">the criteria for setting a good goal.</a></li>
<li>Failure is not absolute. Extract the useful, discard the rest.</li>
<li>Create, don't just consume. This will sharpen you in many ways.</li>
<li>Personal observation: I am most defensive when others do not carefully consider my points of view. I've grown to see this better in recent months. Don't know what to do with it, but I'm happy to have noticed!</li>
<li>A good system, even without a goal, is powerful.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/2013/05/03/intentional-habit-building" title="Lifestyle Design (AKA Intentional Habit Building)">Create a space where the desired habit/system is the easy route</a>, and you'll be successful. Struggling to build a habit = failure.</li>
</ol>
<p>I struggle with systems. I am writing this blog post as an excuse to avoid working on a project. Ironic, yes?</p>
<p>Rather than beating myself over the head for failing to work on a goal that I want to work on, I'm stepping back. What makes this project so distasteful to me? I pursued on my own accord, and still want to go through with it. I think I'm fearful of the undefined, which this thing is. I don't know an obvious next step. Which means the next step is obvious:</p>
<p>Determine the next step. Or the next five steps. Then break each one down into little tiny goals. I've been using <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> for this, and it's been helpful.</p>
<p>Phew.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Monthly Review: November</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/12/01/monthly-review-november</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is my second monthly review, and I'm hooked.
I've thought this coming review frequently, but I thought about that as I was conducting my month. This proactive review is in line with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Frankl">Viktor Frankl's</a> admonition to "live every day as if it were your second chance to live it." This simple piece of advice, and another one, are packaged for free and available in the <a href="http://storylineblog.com/sps/">Storyline Productivity Schedule</a> (it's free, and worth reading).</p>
<h2>November Review</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>My marriage</strong> Kristi and I are growing, and as any relationship does, go through ups and downs. The trend is up, and as I have thought and prayed about our relationship, we have both been able to identify a few specifics that we want to work on and improve. We can (usually) converse easily about the health of our relationship, and work together to love each other better. This month we have both gotten to spend time with our respective families, and we have enjoyed ourselves. There had sometimes been friction with each others families, so this is a big win.</li>
<li><strong>Significant relationships</strong> I write this from my parents house in TN, where more of my family has assembled then has been together in at least three years. I called each of my grand parents once last month, which is one time more than I'd called them in months. Positive progress.</li>
<li><strong>Side projects</strong> I've been so excited about two side projects I've sometimes been unable to fall asleep at night. One is still under wraps, but the other is one I need help with (from all you climbers). I'm writing an e-book about dealing with fear while lead climbing. Last month I said I had to have my edits done by this coming month, and so it's done. I want to get out and get more feedback, then release it to the world.
<p>This side project has quickly morphed into a complicated beast, but I've allowed the total complexity to hinder progress in the small but important ways, like... you know... writing the book. I'm done with the first draft. This is a big deal.</li>
<li><strong>My job</strong> At work we had some of our busiest days of the hear, and in some important ways, at least one day was an almost total failure. It wasn't my fault at all, but it's frustrating. I've found that working in short bursts with a little break is good (when I'm in the office, a sprint up and down the ten flights of stairs is a life changer). I've struggled with hopelessness there, so... I'm still wrestling with that in my head.</li>
<li><strong>Physical goals</strong> My current project is <em>handstands</em>. I can hold myself in the handstand position against a door for about 90 seconds, and I can "hold" a freestanding handstand for, at best, five seconds. But that's five seconds longer than last month. I started with <a href="http://chrissalvato.com/">this blog</a>, and have branched out from there. I've never spent more than five minutes a day practicing. You should give it a shot too.
<p>I've encountered another interesting issue - I fear the opinions of others when practicing this kind of stuff. Seriously. Even practicing at home around my wife, I feel like I had to prove I wasn't insane. She stopped me and said "Josh. You can practice what every you want. You're not in trouble."</p>
<p>Practicing outside is even harder. I've also noticed I don't want to do sprint training in a field by myself, because it will look weird. It's strange, having all this fear, but it's nice recognizing it. Onward!</li>
<li><strong>Finances </strong>Still an important factor to us. Kristi and I had fun conversation when it turned out our credit card was not automatically synching with our money tracking tool, so all of our non-debit spending was not being accounted for. We've fixed that, but we're still nailing these details down.</li>
<li><strong>Debt reduction (student loans, car loan) </strong>Debt reduction ration of 1.0. Sufficient, but far from ideal.</li>
<li><strong>My monthly reviews</strong> On my second monthly review, I've felt that this is extremely good for me. I don't like waiting for a full month, though, so I may toy with a bi-monthly review. Every two weeks. Or maybe a bi-monthly review on some select topics (side projects, finances, and habits being the top candidates). Either way, this reflectivity is extremely helpful. I'd encourage y'all out there to try it. Blogging can be free (I pay $18/yr for the domain, and that's my only cost. So... we'll call it $1.50/mo. Pretty cheap) but can encourage a lot of good things.</li>
<li><strong>Habits</strong> I've struggled to <a href="/blog/2013/04/22/becoming-an-early-riser" title="Becoming an Early Riser">get up early</a>, because I'm struggling to go to bed early. My evening routine is not a routine at all, and I think this is part of the problem. I also lose control of my early-rising habit when traveling. I think it'll help me to lay my clothes out in the morning, and have a clear reason for why I am trying to get up early. That will help get me out of bed. (This all ties back to the PM routine.)
<p>Sometimes I get up at 5:30, feeling great. Sometimes I can't get out of bed before 8:00. Not consistent at all.</p>
<p>For my entire adult life, I've been convinced I don't have dreams, because I never have been aware of any. Then I read <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2009/09/21/how-to-lucid-dream/">Tim Ferris's article on lucid dreaming</a>, and I decided to give it a shot. I'm still in the "write down what you can remember when you wake up" phase, but I'm now aware that I dream, and have vague memories of them.</p>
<p>I've picked up <a href="/blog/2013/05/09/daily-exercise-russian-kettlebells" title="Daily Exercise – Russian Kettlebells">kettlebell swings</a> again. I feel like I'm not challenging myself physically, so I'm back at them. I need more weight - I want to get to 100lb swings, but only have 60lbs of weight to work with. I'll check out local gyms for discarded plates to see if I can get any more weight.</li>
<li><strong>Significant events </strong>Nothing life changing happened in the last few weeks, but there have been lots of little shaping experiences. Serendipitous conversations with important people, or feeling on-the-spot when I didn't have time to prepare. Opportunities to surprise my wife, or be kind to a stranger. These incidents are the stuff of life, and I don't want them to pass me by.</li>
</ul>
<p>This concludes my monthly review. Stay tuned for updates on side projects. If you climb, I will need your help!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Make Hard Things Easier by Removing Friction</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/12/07/make-hard-things-easy-removing-friction</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Friction</em> resists movement.
Lots of things count as (negative) friction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Anything that consumes resources (time, energy, money, physical goods.)</li>
<li>Anything that causes negative feelings (shame, doubt, guilt, fear.)</li>
<li>Anything that could have a downside (losing money, respect, your job.)</li>
<li>Anything that may have no benefit. (Joy, money, respect, a better job.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to make something happen in your life, chances are good that you're not doing it already because of friction.</p>
<p>Think about it - if you wanted to do something, the benefits were obvious, and the barriers non-existent... wouldn't you already be doing it?</p>
<p>So - if you are not content with where you are now, and you have an idea of where you want to be, examine hard the possible sources of friction. If you can eliminate most of that friction, you'll suddenly find it much, much easier to make that thing happen.</p>
<p>I have two examples of changes I wanted to make that were impeded by <em>lots</em> of friction.</p>
<h3>Creating a digital product</h3>
<p>I've wanted to create a digital product that sells itself for a long time. Sounds perfect, right? People give me their money and, after initially setting everything up, it doesn't take any additional work on my behalf.</p>
<p>Here's <em>all </em>the friction I've run into:</p>
<ul>
<li>I've never done this before. Everyone out there who <em>has </em>done it, has, by definition, done it. So I am quantifiably different from those folks that have done this thing.</li>
<li>I don't have any customers. What if I put all this work out, and can't get anyone to buy it?</li>
<li>I've never built a website, or earned money outside of "normal" jobs.</li>
<li>There are 1000 different things I could spent my time on related to this project. How do I know I'm spending my time effectively?</li>
<li>Most people want to do this, and most people never try. Those that do... most of them fail, right? Why would I do anything different.</li>
<li>I already have a full-time job. Why should I spend my limited time finding even <em>more</em> work?</li>
<li>I don't know anything that unique about anything.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's how I got over all of this friction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every single action I take is a learning experience. If something doesn't work, I've learned. (Along those lines - there is no good way to do cold calling.)</li>
<li>If I hit a barrier, I figure out a way to either not need it, or get around it. (Call people, get email addresses, email them, <em>then</em> call again. It's no longer a cold call.)</li>
<li>If I feel out of my element and outside of my comfort zone, I'm doing it right. That stress is now encouragement.</li>
<li>My wife is encouraging, That helps a lot.</li>
<li>All great products and entrepreneurs have sucked or been unsuccessful at one time (or many times!). I'm just running with it - it's OK to feel like I'm making it up as I go.</li>
<li>I'm not done, and I don't think I ever will be. But it is all a learning experience.</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How to complete a project</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/01/01/how-to-complete-a-project</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of us have goals. And we usually don't reach any of them.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">Minimum Viable Product</a> "concept" has helped me with some goals, and it could be helpful to you.</p>
<p>It's a simple concept: When starting something new, figure out what the minimum investment would get you the required return.</p>
<p>Here's how it played out for me in the last few weeks:</p>
<p>I've wanted to write a book about lead climbing, and how to deal with fear. It was so daunting of a project, I put off any progress for a long time, and then once I <em>did</em> start making progress, I easily sidetracked myself down a thousand different rabbit trails.</p>
<p>The only time I have made progress was when focusing on the <em>minimum</em> required investment, and what next step would get me there.</p>
<p>I am far from done, but it's gotten me this far.</p>
<p>Check out www.belaybetter.com to see the results of this particular project. You can download a sample chapter for free, and of course, buy the book if you're interested.</p>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>This is a great tip! It came in handy already when on Monday I had to write a curriculum for teaching a Vacation Bible School on the mission field. I've done it the last three summers, so I was asked to put it in a "box" so that others can replicate it, but how? It has so many moving parts. So I put one step in front of the other, and now it's done!I once heard another tip that has been helpful to me in doing hard things, and which I'll share with you! I learned that our most energized, productive time is in the morning. so if we have a "hard" thing to do, we should do it in the morning! The procrastinator in me would want to do it after doing all the easy things that I need to do that day, but by the end of the day, I'd have no creativity left to do the hard thing! So that is my tip, do those hard things in the morning (which is when I started MY project! By the time the afternoon came around, I was on a roll, but the key was to start it in the morning!)...</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>Talent is Overrated</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/01/09/if-you-can-learn-anything-should-you</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Talent is Overrated</h2>
<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Talent-Overrated-Separates-World-Class-Performers/dp/1591842948">Talent is Overrated</a>, the author argues that world-class performers are <em>not</em> genetically gifted. The difference between world-class performers and the rest of us? Lots of <a href="http://lifehacker.com/what-mozart-and-kobe-bryant-can-teach-us-about-delibera-1442488267">deliberate practice</a>. (Read the article.)</p>
<p>I have no interest in becoming Mozart, or Tiger Woods (oh, and that ship has sailed <em>long</em> ago) but it's not to late for <em>anyone</em> to do one of two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Achieve proficiency in a current skill</li>
<li>Learn something completely new<!--more--></li>
</ol>
<p>Since no one attempts to master or dominate most things that they do, there is tremendous opportunity for <em>you</em> to separate yourself from your peers. Or make big improvements in something because you want to.</p>
<p>The key to either of this is learning how to apply the concept of deliberate practice to the field.</p>
<h2>The First 20 Hours</h2>
<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-First-20-Hours-Anything/dp/1591845556">The First 20 Hours</a>, the author lays out a framework for achieving proficiency in a new field in twenty hours of deliberate practice.</p>
<p>He lays out a reusable approach to any skill. Learning a skill <em>with skill</em> is extremely appealing to me. Taking the "talent is overrated" approach</p>
<p>Ten practices of rapid skills acquisition:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a lovable project</li>
<li>Focus your energy on one skill at a time</li>
<li>Define your target performance level</li>
<li>Deconstruct the skill into subskills</li>
<li>Obtain critical tools</li>
<li>Eliminate barriers to practice</li>
<li>Make dedicated time for practice</li>
<li>Create fast feedback loops</li>
<li>Practice by the clock in short bursts</li>
<li>Emphasize quality and speed</li>
</ol>
<p>He covers a lot in the book, but it is a quick read.</p>
<p>I'm eager to apply these methods to some projects soon. My first project? Programming. I've been messing around with programming for a while, but I'd like to make a small but dedicated push on it.</p>
<p>My first task is getting an environment set up on my computer where I can do the things required to create and publish anything I create, no matter how simple. It's <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">not the easiest to install</a>.</p>
<p>More soon!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Five Days to Inbox Zero: How to Get Control of your Email</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/02/07/five-days-to-inbox-zero-how-to-get-control-of-your-email</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Email is a constant in our lives, yet it can be so overwhelming that it becomes almost 100% ineffective.
I discussed with a friend the other day why they should switch from Yahoo to Gmail, and how to reduce the useless emails they receive. Below is how I suggested they move from one account to another, and how to leave all their crappy emails behind, and how to get to <a href="http://inboxzero.com/video/">Inbox Zero</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If you already use Gmail, save yourself some effort, and sign up for <a href="http://unroll.me" target="_blank">unroll.me</a>, then read <a href="http://klinger.io/post/71640845938/dont-drown-in-email-how-to-use-gmail-more">this article</a> on managing important emails.</strong></p>
<p>If you don't already use Gmail, why should you make the switch?</p>
<ul>
<li>You can <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6576?hl=en" target="_blank">archive</a> any email, and it will be gone from your inbox, but still searchable. (For example, my inbox has four emails in it, but if I look at ALL the email in my account, I've got almost 9000 emails. I can archive it, forget about it, and then use Google's amazing search tools to find it later.)</li>
<li>Google calendar is extremely versatile. Y'all can each plan things, share calendars, and stay on the same page.</li>
<li>Google Drive is a nice way to keep all your files in one place - you can use it on your phone, and do plenty of other things with it.</li>
<li>You can sign into websites using your google accounts.</li>
<li><a href="http://klinger.io/post/71640845938/dont-drown-in-email-how-to-use-gmail-more" target="_blank">You can set up a simple system to keep your email inbox to ZERO!</a> (It is life changing. Seriously. That little article has changed everything about how I manage email.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I've convinced you, here is how to take the plunge: (Substitute "yahoo" with your own service provider.)</p>
<p><b>Day one:</b> Sign up for <a href="http://unroll.me" target="_blank">unroll.me</a>. You'll unsubscribe from everything in your Yahoo account. Could be hundreds of subscriptions. It is life changing.</p>
<p><b>Day two: </b>Head over to <a href="http://gmail.com" target="_blank">gmail.com</a> and sign up for an email account. Some variation of <a href="mailto:firstname.lastname@gmail.com" target="_blank">firstname.lastname@gmail.com</a> is ideal, but I couldn't get anything close to <a href="mailto:josh.thompson@gmail.com" target="_blank">josh.thompson@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<div><b>Day three</b>: Time to clean out your Yahoo inbox. Gmail will automatically import all email in your inbox, so get rid of everything in your inbox that you don't want to keep.I would temporarily move the last three weeks of emails in your inbox to a separate folder, then delete EVERYTHING else in your inbox.</p>
</div>
<p><b>Day four: </b>Follow <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Switch-from-Yahoo%21-Mail-to-Gmail" target="_blank">these steps</a> to import contacts to your gmail account, forward all new email, and get your basic settings tweaked in gmail.</p>
<p><strong>Day five: </strong>Sign up <a href="http://unroll.me" target="_blank">unroll.me</a> for your new Gmail account. Email me when you're done.</p>
<div><b> </b></div>
<div><b>What you've accomplished so far:</b></div>
<div>1. Signed up for gmail.</div>
<div>2. Deleted thousands of emails, and unsubscribed from dozens of news letters.</div>
<div>3. Started fresh with a new email account.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Using the above tools, this is my inbox today: (The things on the right are "to do" "waiting for reply" and "to reference in the next week", respectively. Nothing in the inbox. It's all been processed.)</div>
<div><a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe58e4b0278244cea0e1/1434910436190/inbox_-_thompsonjoshd_gmail_com_-_gmail-10.jpg"><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe58e4b0278244cea0e1/1434910436190/inbox_-_thompsonjoshd_gmail_com_-_gmail-10.jpg" alt="Inbox-thompsonjoshd_gmail_com_-_Gmail-10" class="wp-image-1125 aligncenter" /></a>If you're not controlling your inbox, it is controlling you.<a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/5586fe58e4b0278244cea0e1/1434910436190/inbox_-_thompsonjoshd_gmail_com_-_gmail-10.jpg">

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Yep, my inbox is definitely controlling me, in that it is something I feel compelled to do everyday so that it doesn't get away from me. I resisted getting an email account for many years, but I have no regrets about finally getting an account! You won't remember this era, but when I started in the work force thirty-five years ago, we had secretaries who took phone calls to our office and left messages for us on pink slips if we were out of the office, and we'd return those calls and sometimes have to leave our own pink slips at the other end. Telephone tag in spades. No, email is MUCH more efficient! A tip that has helped me is something I learned from a home organizer who spoke once at a ladies' conference I attended. She spoke about how to tame the paper tiger- she said handle each piece of mail only once. Pick it up, decide what to do with it, and do it when you bring in the mail each day. That tip has helped me tame the email tiger as well! It is definitely a problem that didn't exist thirty-five years ago, but it's a much better one to have than the pink-slip dilemma! So far it hasn't become unmanageable, but if it ever does, I will have to adopt your own successful system! Tons of love, Dear!</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>The Present You</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/07/12/the-present-you</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems most of the decisions in life are made in favor of the <em>present</em> you, or the <em>future</em> you. I wish the future me could sit beside the present me, and discuss how I was going about my day. Instead, it's a rather one-sided conversation.
There are obvious choices, like food, spending money vs. saving, going to bed early - these are all clear calls, and would be even more clear if the future me was here to advocate on his behalf.</p>
<p>There are subtle choices, too. Things like how to engage in relationships with others, how to invest in myself and others. These would benefit the most from a pocket-sized future me.</p>
<p>If anyone invents this, I'll buy.</p>

      <title>Act a Fool, or: Motion vs. Action</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/03/16/act-a-fool-or-motion-vs-action</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you've started reading this article, but have only two minutes, don't read what I'm writing. Go read <a href="http://jamesclear.com/taking-action">this article</a> by James clear. It's called "<a href="http://jamesclear.com/taking-action">The Mistake Smart People Make: Being In Motion vs. Taking Action</a>". I've linked it a third time <a href="http://jamesclear.com/taking-action">here</a>. Go read it.
James starts with a simple definition:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Motion</strong> is when you’re busy doing something, but that task will never produce an outcome by itself. <strong>Action</strong>, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will get you a result.</p></blockquote>
<p>Motion, as defined, obviously won't get you to your goals. It is, be definition, those things that you do that don't produce.</p>
<p>Action, as defined, gets you where you're going. The difference between the two is that you don't get criticized for motion. You can get a ton of criticism for action.</p>
<p>We humans are a cautious bunch - we're more likely to do small things that return small but predictable benefits. Those large things we may do can fail nine times out of ten, and that failure <em>can be</em> devastating.</p>
<p><strong>Applied</strong></p>
<p>We all speak to each other, and the quality of our speech matters. When I think "public speaking", I don't imagine giving a speech to hundreds, I imagine how I carry myself in front of groups of people I don't know well. Incidentally, this is most of the people I interact with.</p>
<p>I wanted to get better at public speaking. So, I read a few articles and watched a few videos. This was all <strong>motion</strong>. I quickly realized this, and thought "the one thing I really don't want to do is give a speech to strangers". So... using that fear as an arrow towards the path of greatest growth, I gave a speech.</p>
<p>[youtube=http://youtu.be/LXbIO3QSeAc]</p>
<p>I read about two paragraphs from "<a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2009/07/11/manvotional-self-made-men-by-frederick-douglass/">The Self-Made Man</a>", a speech by Frederick Douglass and, if you watch the video, you can see that absolutely no one even noticed me. This was an extremely short way to get a little closer to fearlessness in these situations.</p>
<p>Not only does this short exercise exemplify the difference between motion and action, but if you want to get more confident in public, this is a ridiculous but effective method.</p>
<p>I'm trying to keep my eye out for other equally effective short cuts to obtain real-world experience doing difficult/uncomfortable things. If you have ideas, send 'em my way. I won't commit to anything, but I'm open to just about everything.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Excellent. I love the simplicity of looking at things as "motion" v "action" - pretty accurate terms if you ask me.
I also love that you went out into a park and read Douglass. That's action, baby!</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Worked great! How wise of you to have your film crew (KET, no doubt!) stand far away so you'd have to speak loudly! Great step of motion toward a hard thing! Reminds me of how I bought an eggplant a few weeks ago, just to sit in my vegetable bowl. Easy. Then I looked for a recipe. Easy. Then I put it on the menu schedule for dinner. Easy, but when I went to cook it it was rotten! So I will have to overcome my fear of cooking eggplant another day! The important thing is I will HAVE to. Just like your determination will propel you toward YOUR goal too. I'd heard this concept years ago in different terms- the URGENT sometimes crowds out the IMPORTANT. They must BOTH be done! Rock on!</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>I would like a "short cut to real-life experience"  Did you really write that on a blog? Now that is a real life experience.  If you wish to modify the above experiment.   Don't read someone else's writing,  Write your own thoughts. Make them personal and revealing read them in a place where someone you know could rear them and then post them on the internet.  The opportunity for real shame and real failure is a great real life experience but a bad career choice so perhaps the above anonymous reading the writings of an eloquent dead man is a bit safer.  Seriously, caution is advised as the only things that are forever are death and twitter posts.
May I suggest a compromise.</p>

<h3 id="limited-mental-resources.">Limited mental resources.</h3>
<p>There's a point in time when after spending a few weeks or months working on one project/goal, your ability to switch tasks to another project diminishes.</p>
<p>There's plenty of evidence that humans can't multi-task, and those who try just end up doing a lot of things poorly.</p>
<p>On the flip side, if you're working on a project, being familiar with it allows you to hold the whole thing in your head. If you put it down for two months, when you come back you have to refamiliarize yourself with the project.</p>
<p>Over the last few months, I've been on a low-level job hunt. A job hunt (if your me) is mentally draining. Not exhausting, but it took enough of my energy that I put my active side projects on the back burner. Writing regularly being one of those side projects.</p>
<h3 id="big-news">Big News</h3>
<p>This low-level job hunt has ended. I am happy to announce that I'm joining <a href="https://litmus.com/" rel="nofollow">Litmus</a> as a customer success advocate. This opportunity is really exciting because:</p>
<ul>
<li>I get to work with really talented people</li>
<li>The specifics of my role is <em>exactly</em> how I've been developing my skills at my last job with <a href="http://razoo.com" rel="nofollow">Razoo</a>.</li>
<li>This allows me to refocus energy on doing really good work (at Litmus) and building out my side projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>This new role allows a number of key pieces to fall into place in other areas of my life.</p>
<p>I'll get to those next time.</p>

      <title>Falling into Place</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="document_container">
<div>
<h3 id="falling-into-place">Falling into Place</h3>
<p>I recently announced that I got a job with <a href="www.litmus.com" rel="nofollow">Litmus</a>.</p>
<p>A key component of this job search for me was that it be <em>remote</em>.</p>
<p>At my last job, I worked remote regularly, at least one day a week, but the rest of the week, I was in the office.</p>
<p>Remote work is becoming established around the world, but not without some hiccups. Most notably, the CEO of Yahoo <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/02/25/technology/yahoo-work-from-home/" rel="nofollow">ended their remote work policy.</a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://automattic.com/">team</a> behind Wordpress (you know, one of the most trafficked site on the internet) works remotely. Matt Mullenweg <a href="http://ma.tt/2012/09/future-of-work/" rel="nofollow">writes</a> about remote work not just being a "perk", like any other company perk, but gives employees an opportunity they could not otherwise have:</p>
<blockquote><p>We give people the perk and <em>the luxury</em> of being part of an internet-changing company from <em>anywhere in the world.</em></p></blockquote>
<h3 id="what-a-job-cannot-provide">Why Work Remote</h3>
<p>When working remote a certain percentage of my time (as I did at Razoo) there were two distinct perks to the arrangements.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Zero commuting time</strong> It takes me an hour, door-to-door, to get to and from work. That's two hours of my day, and 12% of my <em>conscious</em> day. (Approx. 16 hrs.) Every day I worked from home, it's like I got an extra two hours just handed to me. Since I count commuting time as work time, even though my job doesn't, that brings my percentage of billable hours per day from 80% to 100%. (In other words, not having to commute is an instant pay-raise of 20%, and its tax-free.(Admittedly, I think about these things in a strange way. But why shouldn't you count commuting time as part of your work day? You're not doing it for fun, that's for sure.)</li>
<li><strong>Much more effective work time</strong> Remote work gets a bad rap because of <em>distractions</em>. Sure, you could watch a movie in your bunny slippers and unbrushed teeth, but if that's how you engage with your work, being in an office won't help.<a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried">Jason Fried</a> contends that "<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/jason_fried_why_work_doesn_t_happen_at_work">work doesn't happen at work</a>", because of the factors surrounding them at the office. The "distractions" that managers fear will bog you down at home are actually unavoidable and pervasive <em>only</em> in the office.In short, when I work from home, and had control over distractions, I can dig into projects and move them forward. When I'm constantly interrupted, I struggle to get meaningful work done. I get plenty of busywork done, but nothing substantive.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Luxuries A Business Cannot Provide</h3>
<p>Here's why I'm most excited about remote work. I can live almost anywhere in the planet without impacting my job. There are only two constraints: Internet access, and time zone. Since it's 2014, all of America is wired up with broadband. Same with (to the best of my knowledge) many other urban areas around the world. So - internet access is easy.</p>
<p>Second - time zones. America spans only three, and that's plenty for healthy overlap with your co-workers shifts. So, with remote work, you can easily live anywhere in the USA. Add a time zone, and you can live any where in the Americas. Whoa.</p>
<p>These are luxuries businesses cannot provide at an office, or with extra pay.</p>
<p>And, for at least some people, these are the kinds of opportunities that make an employee want to stick around.</p>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Yes!! The option to telework is the number one reason I've stayed at my job at the USPTO. Thus far I've only been allowed to work one day per biweek from home, which is certainly better than nothing, but I'm really excited because I just got the promotion I needed to be eligible to work from home full time! And I agree completely with your analysis of eliminating commuting time :) Congrats on the new job!!</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>How to Move</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/03/27/how-to-move</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kristi and I are moving to Colorado in July.
We've taken three broad steps to make this move happen:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>We both are in process with new jobs</strong>. I just started working remotely for <a href="http://www.litmus.com">Litmus</a>, which means I can seamlessly transition to Colorado this summer. Kristi spent a few days last week interviewing with public schools and attending a teachers fair in Colorado. We're moving, and we may even be gainfully employed!</li>
<li><strong>We're shedding as many of our possessions as we can</strong>. We're moving to Colorado and don't want to drop $2k for a u-haul truck. We'll be towing the smallest enclosed u-haul trailer available behind our Toyota Corolla. This means limited cargo space. We're both excited about this, because as mentioned before, <a href="/blog/2013/07/04/simplify-simplify-simplify" title="Simplify, simplify, simplify">we're moving in the direction of minimalism</a>. We have a sofa bed that we love, and I really love our kitchen knives and one cast-iron skillet. Everything else is replaceable, so we're trimming down our wardrobes, getting rid of kick-knacks, ditching almost all of our physical books, and <a href="http://www.becomingminimalist.com/sample-living-with-less/">experimenting with less</a>.</li>
<li><strong>We're putting our money where our mouth is</strong>. Moving is not <em>cheap</em>, but it certainly doesn't have to be expensive. Beyond that, we're moving to Colorado for the lifestyle benefits, so we're putting our money in that direction as well. We have a few financial benchmarks that we're working on. We're almost done paying off our car, which we were unexpectedly forced into buying late last year. When we get to Colorado, we'll be able to enjoy the opportunities it offers to the fullest.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Why Move?</h3>
<p>Almost every time we mention we're moving to Colorado, we hear two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>"That is AMAZING! Colorado is great. "</li>
<li>"I wish I could do that."</li>
</ol>
<p>Well - you can. If you accept certain sacrifices, and hustle to line up your cards right, you can do it. There is the spectrum of what it takes to move across the country:</p>
<p><strong>One one end, you could quit your job tomorrow, load up your car, and move.</strong> This would probably leave a few loose ends, and would be better if you just committed a crime and had to hustle out of town. Maybe you should just drive to Mexico if you're in this situation.</p>
<p><strong>On the other end of the spectrum, you may never move until someone offers you a job, a place to live, a relocation bonus, pays for your things and your time, and finds you a friend-group to plug into without any work on your behalf.</strong> This bar is pretty high, and I wouldn't hold my breath.</p>
<p>So - we picked something in the middle. Kristi worked on getting a teaching job, and I worked on getting a remote job. These are both working out, and now we're figuring out what to do with our things and our money. That's it. We're leaving behind friends and family, but these relationships are important enough to invest time and money in maintaining. The rest (casual friendships) can be rebuilt in our new location.</p>
<p>Boom. It's that easy. And so much more complex.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>YOLO stands for "You Only Live Once". It's usually used in a different context as an excuse to make bad decisions, like skip school or drink a ton, but Kristi likes to commandeer it for "serious" uses.

      <title>Playing Pranks</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/04/01/playing-pranks</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My wife played a brilliant prank on me today, as she does every year. Here's a partial list:
<ul>
<li>Convincing me that I was about to eat a slice of carrot cake; it was a sponge covered with toothpaste. I bit into it.</li>
<li>Convincing me that she had, in anger and frustration, cut off almost all of her hair, and had pictures to prove it; unflattering camera angles + bobby pins = confused Josh</li>
<li>Feeding me soapy water</li>
<li>Convincing me she had a <em>very</em> forward suitor who wouldn't take no for an answer; she and I were engaged, and it fell to me to do something about it.</li>
</ul>
<p>She has gotten me many other times. I love April fools day, but I'm not sure why. I don't generally enjoy being tricked, but I love seeing the many things Kristi thinks up, and how she tricks me.</p>
<p>It requires trust. I won't be so easily tricked by most people, but my guard is down (obviously) when I'm with my wife. And this is healthy. I think part of the reason I love April Fools Day is because she couldn't trick me if I didn't trust her. That vulnerability is freeing.</p>
<p>It takes work, though, building a relationship in which you can be vulnerable. I (and I think the rest of humanity) instinctually recoils from vulnerability. And this cheapens our relationships, robs us of opportunities for joy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Why I Eat Bacon Every Day (And You Should Too)</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/04/08/why-i-eat-bacon-every-day-and-you-should-too</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love breakfast.
Almost every morning for the last three years <strong>I have had a frying pan full of bacon, and three eggs</strong>.</p>
<p>There are plenty of reasons I do this. Every one knows protein is good for you. But that fat... that grease. That cholesterol. I'm going to die young, right?</p>
<p><strong>I don't think so.</strong></p>
<p>Before you dismiss me out of hand, just look through two articles.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2013/02/19/the-definitive-guide-to-bacon/">The Definitive Guide to Bacon</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2013/01/18/how-to-increase-testosterone-naturally/">Art of Manliness "Boost Your Testosterone - Naturally" </a></li>
</ul>
<p>I won't go into it all here, but know this: <strong><em>There is a group of intelligent, scientifically literate people who believe it is good</em><em> for you to eat bacon and eggs every day.</em></strong></p>
<p>If you love bacon, but it's too much work every day to cook - tune in on Thursday. I'm going through my method to remove all friction from the cooking process, and make it the best part of your morning.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Josh, I too have been learning that a high fiber/low fat diet is just the OPPOSITE of what our bodies need, not to mention what tastes good, to which you can testify! I myself eat three eggs, an avocado, full-fat yogurt, coconut oil, and cod liver oil -everyday! I am glad you have defied the conventional, misguided food mantra of the day- you are healthier for it!CAY
PS I just today bought you two pounds of bacon to eat for breakfast when you visit next week! :) Can't wait!</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

<p>"The more things change, the more they stay the same."
Or something like that. Sometimes change is for the better, and sometimes its for the worse. I don't know if there's always a difference.</p>
<p>Recently, Kristi and I have seen lots of change; I'd say its for the better, but it's not without difficulties. We've both gotten new jobs, and moved to Colorado. Each of those could take up a few thousand words a piece, but I consider it sufficient to say "things have changed".</p>
<p>And in other ways, things have not changed. We are part of a wonderful community that is not tied to a specific location. We have our family, and good friends. The Gospel continues to be true.</p>

      <title>Accomplishments and Achievements</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/07/02/accomplishments-and-achievements</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We're encouraged to accomplish and achieve, yes? From birth, we pass milestones. Generally these milestones grow in complexity as we add to our abilities - it's been a while since I've been rewarded for not wetting myself - but they are usually on par with our abilities.
For example, we expect high school graduation of high schoolers, college graduation of college students, etc. Most (<em>most</em>) middle-schoolers are not forced into college prep. I pity those that are.</p>
<p>Maybe it's my imagination, but there is a subtle tension between <em>accomplishments</em> and <em>achievements</em>.</p>
<p>Accomplishments seem to be external. Achievements seem to be more internal. Graduation, a job - this is an accomplishment. But would you say "Graduating college is an achievement"? Maybe.</p>
<p>How about feeling peace, or joy? <em>Achieve</em> seems more tied to a state of being. An accomplishment is related to a task, or a state of doing.</p>
<p>Here's my question - we strive for accomplishments, and encourage others to do the same. But does this happen at the expense of achieving a state of joy, or peace, or contentedness?</p>
<p>Here's some definitions of these words. They didn't clear it up for me:</p>
<p><strong>accomplishment</strong> |əˈkämpliSHmənt|
noun
something that has been achieved successfully: the reduction of inflation was a remarkable accomplishment.
• the successful achievement of a task: the accomplishment of planned objectives.
• an activity that a person can do well, typically as a result of study or practice: long-distance running was another of her accomplishments.
• skill or ability in an activity: a poet of considerable accomplishment.</p>
<p><strong>achievement</strong> |əˈCHēvmənt|
noun
1 a thing done successfully, typically by effort, courage, or skill: to reach this stage is a great achievement.
2 the process or fact of achieving something: the achievement of professional recognition | assessing ability in terms of academic achievement | a sense of achievement.</p>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Was reading in Deuteronomy the other day; 28:47 says "...serve the Lord your God with joy and a glad heart." Accomplishment is, as you say, the doing, like the "serving" in this verse. Perhaps achieving is the same "doing," but a doing that produces peace, or joy, in the doing. Something akin to the "joy and a glad heart" described in this verse. You are asking a good, deep question. You have always been quite good at that!Love,
Mom</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

The wander around all morning eating. I get to watch." class="size-large wp-image-1180" /></a>
Kristi and I moved to Golden, Colorado. We've been in our new apartment for five days. I'm trying to quickly settle into a routine that makes sense for both of us.</p>
<p>For example - I work for a company in Boston. While I could keep local working hours (Mountain Time) I prefer to free up my afternoons and evenings by keeping Eastern time. So my work day starts at 6:30am. I don't want to be rushed in the morning, so I'd like to be getting up by about 5:30.</p>
<p>So far, I've been getting up when I want, but I'm getting very tired by the early evening. I'm not going to bed early enough.</p>
<p>My priority right now is to figure out 1) How to go to bed early and 2) how to incorporate naps into my day.</p>
<p>Both of these take thought, and are not something I'll just throw myself into.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Josh, let me just tell you I CANNOT tell you how happy I am with your new lives in Colorado!  Secondly, let me give you an idea for resolving your afternoon fatigue problem without having to get to bed earlier in the evening or take naps in the afternoon: Set your circadian rhythm! I get to bed by 11:00 every night, without fail, and wake up no later than 6:00, without an alarm clock and well rested. (You can of course adjust the times to meet your needs.) Key to setting your circadian rhythm is getting full sun for fifteen to thirty minutes in the morning to signal "daytime" to your body (I go out around 10 AM), and shutting down all electronics and bright lights an hour before bedtime to signal "nighttime" to your body (use only yellow lights, read, wind down to signal your brain to start producing melatonin, the sleep hormone). I hope this helps!Love,
Mom</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>Corollas and U-Hauls</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/07/05/corollas-and-u-hauls</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These last few posts have a theme. We moved. I'm writing about it a lot because I thought about it a lot, and a lot of work went into it.
When moving across the country, you have a few options. You could higher a moving company, who comes and boxes up your house, packs a truck, drives the truck, and unpacks it when you arrive. This is expensive.</p>
<p>You can also get a movable storage container, like a POD. This is expensive.</p>
<p>You can rent a truck that fits all your things, and tow your car behind it. This is expensive. It would have been about $2300 for us to go this route.</p>
<p>So, we towed a U-haul behind our Corolla.</p>
<p>The total price, including getting a hitch installed, was about $500. It was 4x8x4. 128 cubic feet.</p>
<p>Because of the weight, we didn't go much faster than 60 mph the entire drive out. Nineteen hours of driving the first day, sixteen the second.</p>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Josh, I am replying here because my untechno whizzy self doesn't know if my attempts at posting my comments to your blog are working. You'll have to let me know! This way I can be more personal, too!  Dad and I are so amazed, impressed, and proud of your adventurous and ambitious spirit. I think Kristi got it directly from her parents and you got it from your grandparents! Kristi told me of the encouragement her folks gave her, that they had considered temporarily moving to Switzerland after they got married, but when they got involved with life they were never again free enough to to it, so they were all for you two pursuing your dreams early in your marriage. Then, of course, your grandparents left on a great adventure by coming to the United States shortly after they got married, because they, like you, were looking for a better life. So you both come by this spirit honestly. Then, of course, growing up, moving for you was second nature! Well done, and congratulations!!!  I love you!  CAY</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>Independence Day</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/07/04/independence-day</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today is Independence Day. We celebrate gaining freedom from Great Britain.
I wonder what countries might celebrate gaining freedom from oppressors today. Perhaps Ukraine? How about Tibet? Taiwan? North Korea? Syria? These all make sense, and we'll talk today about taking freedom to these nations. Bad things happen to them, and we (the world) want to make it stop.</p>
<p>What about Yemen? Iraq? Pakistan? Mexico? It is naïve to think these nations have the same view of our presence as we do.</p>
<p>If we want to end suffering in other countries, why not open our borders to their fleeing refugees? Lebanon is home to a few million dislocated Iraqi refugees, and they're not happy about it. Oh, and now Syrians.</p>
<p>Last election cycle Ron Paul had the highest percentage of the military vote, and he advocates non-interventionism. If we support our troops, why not bring them home. (I know I'm off on holidays at the moment. It was on my mind.)</p>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Freedom for me would selfishly look like an empty inbox (yes, I should go back and read your blog post "Five Days to Inbox Zero: How to Get Control of your Email." I am using the holiday to catch up! What freedom REALLY looks like is what we celebrate today, the anniversary of the decision to declare freedom from OUR oppressor two hundred eight years ago (I am so glad France helped us!) and what it looks like today would be freedom from those who would muzzle our hard-fought freedoms, among which are freedom of religion (think "mandatory abortion coverage") and freedom of speech (think PC police). Thanks for offering me the opportunity to exercise that latter freedom here! Happy Independence Day, Dear!Love,
Mom</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>The Power of an Audacious Goal</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/07/06/the-power-of-an-audacious-goal</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I generally try to hedge the risks I face. I'm no daredevil, nor do I love danger, but I do love pursuing opportunities that take me beyond my comfort zone. The funny thing about going beyond your comfort zone is that once you've done it once or twice, you redefine your comfort zone to encompass that thing.
Public speaking is an easy example. Many people are terrified of it, but once they've done it a few times, it is no big deal. They would have to speak in front of a larger audience to feel nervous, but once they have done that, they now find that comfortable.</p>
<p>For this reason, I recommend you start building an audacious goal. Who knows what it is? You probably don't even know what it is yet. Kristi and I had one, and just knocked it off the list. We moved to Colorado. Last night we were sketching out our next one. It's invigorating, to be working towards a goal.</p>
<p>Anxious and overwhelmed? That means you're doing it right. Here's a way to move forward: http://chrisguillebeau.com/what-to-do-when-you-feel-overwhelmed/</p>

      <title>What Do You Do?</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/07/07/what-do-you-do</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I enjoy meeting new people. Usually, one of the first questions I'll ask them is "What to you do?"
They usually respond with their occupation, or their status in school. My follow-up question is "When you're not doing that, what do you do?"</p>
<p>Sometimes this is a conversational dead-end. Sometimes they really light up. This is always exciting. We're not our jobs, but we are some component of what we do. So do something that's exciting, and be excited about it. Do you like knitting? Then knit up a storm. If you like video games, well... maybe that's exciting. Some folks have monetized their video-game playing. That's exciting. Do exciting things. Then come tell me about 'em. I want to hear.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Typing in Colemac 2.0</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/07/11/typing-in-colemac-2-0</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I want to learn to type in Colemak, but I'm afraid to try to invest twenty hours in it. That's a long commitment, and I'm afraid I would not follow through, and feel like it was a failure, because I didn't allot enough time, nor reach a desired level of skill.
My hope is that as I outline this approach, it could be helpful to others (or to a future me) who are trying to add to their skillset. Obviously few people are going to learn an alternative keyboard layout. But learning how to learn... the audience is wide for that one.</p>
<p>Here's my rethought out approach:</p>
<p><a href="http://joshkaufman.net/">Josh Kaufman</a> suggests ten principles of Rapid Skills Acquisition, and I'm <a href="http://www.first20hours.com/typing/">copying him shamelessly</a>. Here they are below:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Choose a loveable project</strong><strong>. </strong>I've tried before to learn. I was excited then, am excited now. It's perfectly nerdy, and has the potential to boost my typing speed while reducing finger strain. I work behind a desk for a living - carpal tunnel would be a bummer.</li>
<li><strong>Focus your energy on one skill at a time. </strong>Let it be known - I will spend five hours practicing, and will finish less than a week after the first session. I'll be focused.</li>
<li><strong>Define target performance level</strong><strong>.</strong> In five hours I would like to be up to 20 wpm according to <a href="http://type-fu.com/">Type Fu</a>, one of the programs I'll be using.</li>
<li><strong>Deconstruct the skill into subskills.</strong> Set up new keyboard. Learn new letters. Learn words. Learn sentences. Learn common bigrams and trigrams.</li>
<li><strong>Obtain Critical tools. </strong><a href="http://colemak.com/Mac">Change layout</a>. Change CAPS LOCK to Backspace. Start with <a href="http://first20hours.github.io/keyzen-colemak/">this tool </a>to learn the letters. Move to <a href="http://type-fu.com/">Type Fu</a> once I have letters down at 98% accuracy. Move <a href="https://code.google.com/p/amphetype/">here</a> for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigram">bigrams</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigram">trigrams</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Eliminate barriers to practice. </strong>I will start <a href="http://selfcontrolapp.com/">SelfControl</a> for one hour whenever I start training. I have blacklist of all social media sites, Reddit, Hacker News, and a number of news aggregates. All the things I am distracted by on the internet. I will turn my phone off and put it in another room.</li>
<li><strong>Make dedicated time for practice.</strong> I will practice twice a day, for twenty minutes each session. Once when I finish working, and again in the late evening, before bed.<strong>
</strong></li>
<li><strong>Create fast feedback loops.</strong> Every tool provides accuracy and speed metrics. Very fast feedback loops.</li>
<li><strong>Practice by the clock in short bursts.</strong> Like I said - twenty minutes minimum, thirty minutes max. Short, focused bursts.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasize quantity and speed.</strong> Done.</li>
</ol>
<p>Below is my "setup", ready for practice. I'll outline the modifications I made to my system in later posts. (Remapping your CAPS LOCK key to backspace is fantastic. I did it about six months ago, and will never go back.)</p>

      <title>STOP YELLING ON THE INTERNET, or, A Better Use for the Caps Lock Key</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/07/16/stop-yelling-on-the-internet-or-a-better-use-for-the-caps-lock-key</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My current project is to learn to type using an alternative keyboard layout called Colemak.
QWERTY has problems. Here are a few, shamelessly borrowed from <a href="http://colemak.com/FAQ">Colemak.com</a></p>
<ul>
<li>It places very rare letters in the best positions, so your fingers have to move a lot more.</li>
<li>It suffers from a high same finger ratio that slows down typing and increases strain.</li>
<li>It allows for very long sequences of letters with the same hand (e.g. "sweaterdresses")</li>
<li>It was designed to prevent the keys from sticking, without any consideration to ergonomic or efficiency aspects.</li>
<li>It was designed so the word "typewriter" could be typed on the top row to ease demonstrations.</li>
<li>It suffers from an extremely high ratio of home-row-jumping sequences (e.g. "minimum")</li>
</ul>
<p>Devorak is the most commonly known alternative keyboard layout (citation needed) but, for a number of reasons, Colemak wins the race. Mostly because Colemak keeps common keyboard shortcuts, like CTRL+V, C, B, X, Z, Q, and others. Less letters move around in Colemak, so it's less of a hassle to learn.</p>
<p>That said, it's still quite difficult! I never realized how powerful muscle memory was until I remapped the caps lock key to delete.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend making this modification on your keyboard, even if you never plan on switching away from QWERTY. It makes such a difference. Here are a few of the benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Faster use of backspace</strong>. The delete key is ten times as far from your hands as the caps lock key. This takes time.</li>
<li><strong>Less finger strain</strong>. Since you're not stretching, it's easier on your hands.</li>
<li><strong>Use the mouse while deleting</strong>. This is a big one. Without this modification, if you want to click&gt;delete, click&gt;delete you need one hand on the mouse, and the other reaches across the keyboard. It's annoying. It's even worse on a laptop, where you have to move your right hand from mouse pad to delete and back, every time.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, how do you make the switch? I will give Mac users instructions. PC users, you are more or less <a href="http://bit.ly/1t1nCS0">on your own</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install <a href="https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/seil.html.en">Seil</a>. Run it.</li>
<li>Under "Caps Lock" check the "Change Caps Lock" option. Set the new behavior to "Delete".</li>
<li>Open up your System Preferences. Navigate to Keyboard Settings.</li>
<li>On the "Keyboard" tab, open "Modifier Keys". Under "Caps Lock Key" choose "No Action". If you don't do this, your new Delete key won't repeat. It would just delete one character per keystroke.</li>
</ol>
<p>OK. Now your caps lock key deletes. This was the easy part. Now you have to train your brain to use it. The only way I was successful was by remapping <em>another</em> key. I changed the normal delete key to "Left Shift" This way, <em>I could not use it any more. I HAD to use the caps lock key if I wanted to delete anything.</em></p>
<p>Let me warn you - this is is frustrating for the first few days. You'll think hard about using caps lock, you'll be successful, but as soon as you start thinking about something else, you'll start using the normal delete key.</p>
<p>So - Set this up. Give it a shot. I'm thrilled that I did, and I use both delete keys interchangeably. I also YELL LESS ON THE INTERNET!</p>
<p>Next, I'll cover what I've learned about typing while learning Colemak!</p>

      <title>Learn to Type - Again</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/07/16/learn-to-type-again</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, we talked about why the <a href="/blog/2014/07/16/stop-yelling-on-the-internet-or-a-better-use-for-the-caps-lock-key">Caps Lock key should be converted into a delete key</a>.
<h4>What I've learned from learning Colemak</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Short, focused practice yields great results.</strong> When I start a timer for twenty minutes, I feel a sense of urgency, rather than defeat. Time boxing practice seems to be fantastic.</li>
<li><strong>I get mentally drained very quickly. </strong>It's difficult to fight my muscle memory so much. It's frustrating to be constantly hitting the wrong key. I find myself fading and becoming apathetic sometimes in less than twenty minutes. My accuracy and speed go down dramatically when I'm tired.</li>
<li><strong>Immediate feedback is crucial. </strong>All the programs I've used give immediate visual and audible feedback when I hit the wrong key. This means I don't have to watch what I'm typing, and am able to focus just on what I want to type.</li>
<li><strong>I need to focus far less on speed, and far more on accuracy.</strong> When I'm "lazy", I type "quickly" (30-40 wpm) but have an accuracy rate of only 90%. That would be great if it were a test, but that means I'm making an error every ten characters. When I slow down, and get closer to 20 wpm, my accuracy goes up, and I'll start hitting 98%. One error every ten characters is very different from one error every 48 characters.</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Process</h4>
<p>Started with <a href="http://first20hours.github.io/keyzen-colemak/">KeyZen</a>, to learn the finger positions. I struggled (and still do) to get R and S straightened out. I keep hitting the wrong one. I finished the KeyZen stage after about 45 minutes of practice, or two sessions. (I just went through the whole lower-case alphabet.</p>
<p>Next, I went on to <a href="http://type-fu.com/">TypeFu</a>. I started with words for one session, and went to proverbs the next. I was feeling like I was not making much progress, since I kept making the same mistakes, over and over, and was typing slowly.</p>
<p>So I went to <a href="https://code.google.com/p/amphetype/">Amphetype</a>, to focus on the most common words in the English language. This was my first lesson:</p>
<blockquote><p>the of and the of and the of and the of the of and the of and the of and the of the of and the of and the of and the of</p></blockquote>
<p>Pretty basic, but quite effective. I stayed on each lesson until I could type it with 98% accuracy, and above 20 words per minute. This has been, by far, the most effective way of learning Colemak. I've stayed with Amphetype for the last four sessions, and am not planning on stopping for a while. The process to populate the lessons took a bit of researching, because it's a now-defunct side project of a Python programer.</p>
<p>The interface is ugly, but it works.</p>
<p>As a side note, I think the above process would work splendidly for anyone that is hunting-and-pecking. You already know where the keys are, you just need to train yourself to stop looking at the keyboard. Also, you wouldn't have to be un-training yourself from using the wrong keys.</p>
<p>Does anyone here hunt and peck, or know anyone who does who wants to learn to type? I bet that with a total of two hours of practice, spread out in small chunks over a few days, anyone can be typing above 60 wpm without looking at the keyboard.</p>
<p>Anyone who already touch types and wants to get better - the above method should work! The difference between typing 50-60 words per minute (or less) and typing mostly at the speed at which you can think is astounding. Typing at around 20 words per minute is frustrating.</p>
<p>As you can probably guess, I've typed this in QWERTY. But I'm off to practice Colemak!</p>

Yesterday, I was struggling to be engaged in my work. I was easily distracted, and didn't feel very efficient during the day.

Turns out I was running a fever of almost&nbsp;102 degrees! My wife took such good care of me. She practically jumped out of her chair and ran out the door for medicine and crackers and soda and soup when I took my temperature.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_169388">I felt so pampered and cared for. From evening till morning, and through the day. I worked a half-day today at work, and spent a lot of time sleeping. Kristi has been attentive, caring, and encouraging throughout. My wife is incredible. Now I hope to not make her sick...</p>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Dear Ones (Josh, I am sending this to Kristi too since she is your nurse!),  Such a sweet thing to read.  Josh, even when you are sick you write well!  Nurse Kristi: You, who are so into nutrition (I love it!), I must tell you that your patient will heal faster if you don't give him sugar. Sugar slows down the healing process because it feeds the bad bacteria in the gut (whether one is sick or not!), and hence fights against your immune system doing the wonderful things it was designed to do! Studies exist on how however much sugar you eat it extends the sickness by so many hours, but I can't put my finger on that stat right now. I'm in Maryland and my notes are in Tennessee!) (By the way, when caring for your patient, don't pinch his stomach! Josh will explain!)  Love,  CAY</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

Me thinks that there is not only one doctor in the family but there are many which is good because each one has a different approach  do to different sources of information, and everything helps. Today I am not going to add to the information but it may come a day that I will too. Hope you are recuperated and did not pass the bug to Kristi in which case it will be you Josh who will have to demonstrate your abilities and procedures as a doctor.

      <title>Winter on Two Pairs of Socks</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/07/23/winter-on-two-pairs-of-socks</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We're <a href="http://www.theminimalists.com/minimalism/">minimalists</a>, mostly. We try to not have a bunch of stuff. This naturally extends to the wardrobe.
I'll cover more about what we wear another time, but for now, I want to give you an idea. With the right socks, you can go an entire winter with just two pairs of socks. You wear one, and the other sits in your drawer. When one pair is dirty (which can take some time, with the right socks) you wash 'em and switch.</p>
<p>Packing is easy. You wear on pair. To cover all sock-wearing needs, you put your other pair in your bag. Done.</p>
<p>These are not normal socks, of course. I have been wearing <a href="http://us.icebreaker.com/en/mens-socks/lifestyle-ultra-lite-crew-stripey/100113K90L.html?prefn1=activity&amp;start=18&amp;cgid=mens-socks&amp;prefv1=Travel%20%26%20Lifestyle">Icebreaker Stripey</a> socks for about a year, now. When not wearing those, I wore some old wool socks until my Icebreaker socks dried. (I didn't wear them only when they smelled foul, which took usually at least four days of daily use).
I've not been extremely thrilled with the Icebreaker socks, and recently wore a hole through them. (Daily use for a year could seem excessive, but I have high standards.) Icebreaker Customer Support kindly sent me a replacement pair, and it seems the problem I had with the first pair will not be a problem with the second.That said, I'm still interested in trying a pair of <a href="http://darntough.com/men/mens-lifestyle">Darn Tough </a>socks as my "other" pair. Two good pairs of socks cover all my cold-weather <em>and </em>dress-sock needs. (I wear these in formal occasions, too. Anytime I wear long pants, one of these pairs of socks is on my feet.So - washing. What's up with that. How I do it?Yes. In a sink. Or in the shower. Or in a washing machine. (But do <em>not </em>put them through the drier). The wool used by Icebreaker or Darn Tough is not like cotton. It doesn't pick up odor, it dries quickly, and it easily releases any stink it does pick up. So, when in the shower, soak the socks, maybe add a little soap, get them wet, rinse them out, hang them up, and they'll be dry and stink-free in the morning.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Benefits of helplessness</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/07/23/benefits-of-helplessness</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last few days were rough, strangely enough. I live in beautiful Golden, Colorado with my best friend (who I happen to be married to), and I've got a pretty cool job to boot. That's the "big three", right? (Relationships, work, location.)
Yep. Except from Thursday through Monday, I was more or less sick as a dog. I could barely talk, slept extremely poorly, and had a fever that was usually north of 101. I spent a lot of time sleeping, and the rest of the time wishing I was asleep.</p>
<p>We spent a lot more at Rite Aid than we normally would, I watched a lot of movies, and played a fair amount of video games. (More accurately, I existed in the same physical spaces as a movie that was turned on. My attention wandered, as did my consciousness.) I read about six paragraphs, over those six days, and worked at least a few hours of them.</p>
<p>So - what good came from these five days?</p>
<p>Plenty. I just have to look for it.</p>
<ol>
<li>I was loved by my wife. I didn't have to lift a finger in my own aid. It's rare that I'm totally bedridden, and it was good let myself be served, free of guilt and trying to serve back. Marriage isn't 50/50. These last few days it was 100/0.</li>
<li>I was forced to do nothing. &lt;Insert rant about American-style business.&gt; It was harder than I first expected, mostly because a lot of the things I normally would do I was unable to do.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am blessed. These last few days helped that really sink in.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Injury Impedes Improvement</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/09/24/injury-impedes-improvement</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_100899">Kristi and I have&nbsp;been in Colorado for three months, I've been climbing regularly for two, I am back in shape and it feels good.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_100902">I am tempted&nbsp;to throw myself into climbing again. To climb every day, or maybe every other day, and finish every session with training. But here's the thing... I want to take the "long view" of climbing.&nbsp;I want to be climbing way harder in ten years than I am&nbsp;right now. I have every reason to think that this is totally possible, as long as I stay injury-free.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_100905"><strong>Injury Impedes Improvement</strong></p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_100909">The biggest barrier to continual improvement is injury. We all actively avoid injury, but other than trying to not hit the ground too hard, I've never been systematic in&nbsp;this pursuit.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_100912">In taking the "long view",&nbsp;I'm trying to think more in training <em>cycles</em> rather than just <em>training</em>.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_100921">Previously, I would climb every other day, or sometimes every day, and try to work hard (and haphazard) training into every session. I'd spend time on the campus boards until I felt elbow tendonitis creeping in. Next, I'd spend a few weeks on the finger board, and then back to campusing, and I'd always just move to the next thing when I had pain&nbsp;in one area of my body or another.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_100924">This method of training is a great way to get full-blown elbow tendonitis, or damage a tendon, or pull a muscle. Assuming we are all humans, we could get injured in two ways:</p><ol id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_100927"><li><strong>Overuse injury</strong>. Your shoulders, fingers, and especially elbows seem sensitive to tendonitis. We've all&nbsp;felt the onset of elbow tendonitis (some more often than others).</li><li><strong>Too strong injury</strong>. As humans, we are quite adaptive to our environment.&nbsp;This adaptivity is <em>usually</em> great (Thanks, great great great great grandpa for living long enough to have some kids!) but if our muscles get stronger faster than our tendons get stronger, we expose our tendons to unsafe forces. (Our muscles have a lot of blood flow. Tendons have almost none. That should tell you that one can develop faster than the other.)</li></ol><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_100940"><strong>Cycles are your Friend</strong></p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_100944">If your muscles can grow strong faster than your tendons, this allows you to plot out what your improvement could look like. Rather than being a smooth up-and-to-the-right line, your strength should look more like stair steps. Get stronger in a short period of time, and then remain at that level for a period of time, to give your body time to catch up. If you skip this "waiting" period", you'll just outpace your tendon's capabilities by a larger and larger margin. Inevitably, you'll be psyched on some move you can do that you couldn't do before, give it 100% effort, and POP, something's strained, at best, or, at worst, ruptured/torn.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_100947">I don't want to do this. So I'm thinking a lot about what these cycles will look like. More to come.</p>

      <title>Don't Focus on the Present</title>

<p>If you accept the premise that training <em>cycles</em> are the method by which you will improve your climbing, you <em>should</em> be able to focus less on the day-by-day fluctuation in your performance.
At least, I should be able to, since I accept that premise. Yet I still struggle to not be moderately disappointed if I don't perform as I hope. The antidote is thus:</p>
<p>Build a plan. Evaluate success on how hard that plan pushes you, while still being possible. Then follow that plan.</p>
<p>I missed the mark in a recent session because I couldn't put together a plan that was challenging <em>and</em> possible. One or the other was easy, but I couldn't get both.</p>
<p>My goal was a ten-move sequence on a systems board that was very challenging, but could be barely be done repeatedly with 60 seconds of rest between attempts.</p>
<p>Next time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Letter to Two Climbers (Part 2)</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/10/18/letter-to-two-climbers-part-2</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello again, it's me! We met climbing a few days ago.<a href="/blog/2014/10/12/letter-to-two-climbers-part-1" title="Letter to Two Climbers (Part 1)"> I wrote you a letter</a>, but didn't want to leave it on such a pessimistic note.
First, I commend you both for getting out there. You both invested a lot in making that weekend happen. You acquired the correct tools, and spent money to do so. You spent time learning how to use your gear, and building the skills you needed to climb outside. You spent a lot of <em>time</em> driving to the crag, spending a night or two out there, and climbing for a few days. (Oh, and gas money, food, and all that.)</p>
<p>Now - not only did you do all those things, but you <em>limited</em> your other options. You could have spent that money on anything else. (Literally. That's what's cool about money! You can spend it for just about anything. Even weed!) You could have spent your <em>time</em> doing anything<em> </em>else. You truly had a universe of options to spend your time and your money, and you spent it on climbing.<!--more--></p>
<p>A lot of climbers get pretty uppity and exclusive, and I'm just as often an offender, but I sincerely thank you. Climbing's pretty rad, and I'm <em>thrilled </em>to see others getting after it! (And who am I to claim exclusive rights to the sport? I've not done anything amazing. If all I've got on someone is being <em>older</em> or having done it <em>longer</em>, that's a pretty weak case.)</p>
<p>I'm also quite glad you are both safe. No one wants to get injured, or watch someone get injured.</p>
<p>I've been around the block a few times, made plenty of dumb (and not so dumb) mistakes, and learned from some pretty smart people, so, please, carefully consider what I share.</p>
<p>If we keep a few principles in mind, we will stay safe. And, we'll have fun. And we'll get better at climbing.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fear can keep you alive. </strong>Fear is a little (or big) alarm going off saying "Danger! Danger! Something bad can happen!" Last I checked, just about everything we do while climbing has the potential for disaster. We spend minutes or hours at a height where an unrestrained fall would be 100% fatal. I'd say if you <em>don't</em> have an alarm bell going off, you've got something wrong with you. So, pay close attention to your fear. It monitors much more than your conscious attention can, and consequently picks up a lot more from your environment than you could ever consciously identify. Don't poo poo the universe's most impressive bit of biology giving you a warning. This would be arrogance, not bravery.</li>
<li><strong>Never go too far beyond your comfort zone. </strong>Want to know what happens when you go too far beyond your comfort zone? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=fail+videos" target="_blank">Best case, you end up on YouTube</a>, and everyone laughs. Worst case, you are dead. (Or very close to dead.) Public speaking can be scary, but it's unlikely you'll end up dead. Screwing up a technical ascent of K2 will leave you dead nine times out of ten. Sport climbing is closer to climbing K2 than it is to public speaking.</li>
<li><strong>Always go beyond your comfort zone. </strong>You know what happens when you don't go beyond your comfort zone? Nothing. And that should scare you just as much as going too far beyond your comfort zone.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it for now. Soon, I'll cover how to stay in that sweet spot of a comfort zone. Stay tuned.</p>
<p>Affectionally yours,</p>
<p>-Josh</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>A Small Goal is Better than a Grand Plan</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/10/20/a-small-goal-is-better-than-a-grand-plan</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all have grand plans. Who's future projection of themselves goes something like this: "One day, when I'm rich (goal one), location independent (goal two), and married to a fabulous woman (goal three), I will travel the world (goal four) while exploring my hobby of _______ (goal five)."
Sounds nice, but this narrative assume so much, and is so ill-defined. With such a disconnect between <em>here</em> and <em>there </em>, why wouldn't you just go play video games all evening. Again. We'll work on that stuff later.</p>
<p>I suspect many of us struggle with the above problem. Great big grand goals completely disconnected from reality. No clue where to begin, and it's all daunting anyway. So lets go do something else.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, I've grown less-bad at breaking big problems into little problems, and dealing with those small things. I've made progress towards some big life goals (I married a fabulous woman!) and have plenty of progress to make towards other goals. (I don't yet own a jet/boat/villa.)<!--more--></p>
<h3>Motion is Easy, Can be Pointless</h3>
<p>The last two years have been marked by completely disconnected, insignificant bits of progress towards over a dozen different goals. I've learned a little Excel, basic HTML and CSS, Python, Ruby, database management, SEO optimization, amateur-at-best handstands, a little bit of business consulting skills, public speaking skills, amateur-at-best running skills, intermediate-at-best Krav Maga skills, too many hours of Call of Duty, a bunch of books, a brief foray into meditation/mindfulness, "mental math", learned a few chords on the Ukulele, spent far too many hours on Reddit, wrote (and than abandoned) a small book, filmed (but never edited) climbing instructional videos, own (and have ideas for) a half-dozen domains, read a few books on stock investing, then real estate investing, spent a ton of time on work-related side projects, and who knows what else.</p>
<p>The above represents a tremendous amount of activity, but zero progress. I can carry on a half-intelligent conversation on a few different subjects, but in none of the above areas have I had a significant impact on anyone's life, except for my own.</p>
<p>There are two items on the list that belong in a category of their own. I've undertaken only two things with consistency and intentionality, and I (if no one else) have derived significant benefit from these things... and I just spent twenty minutes on Twitter. Where was I?</p>
<p>Oh, right. Important things, consistency, impacting lives. Climbing and writing. Climbing is, well... it's climbing. Writing does, occasionally, bring a clarity to my own thinking. I sincerely hope to be helpful/useful to others, but writing is without peer for solidifying my own thinking. So I write. About one in three times I hit the "publish" button.</p>
<p>So what's the solution? How does any of us resolve the tension between the <em>what is </em>and the <em>what could be</em>.</p>
<h3>Think of the Slope, not the Y-Intercept</h3>
<p>Stanford Professor John Ousterhout had a reputation for lectures categorized as "thoughts for the weekend". One of his most memorable was titled <em><a href="http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-profound-life-lessons-from-Stanford-Professor-John-Ousterhout">A little bit of slope makes up for a lot of y-intercept</a>. </em>Please, read his lecture. It's very short. His summary paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>I often ask myself: have I learned one new thing today?  Now you guys are younger and, you know, your slope is a little bit higher than mine and so you can learn 2 or 3 or 4 new things a day.  But if you just think about your slope and don't worry about where you start out you'll end up some place nice.</p></blockquote>
<p>This quote, this idea, is the resolution between what is and what can be. Try to learn two or three new things a day, and you'll end up some place nice.*</p>

He performed the first successful separation of Siamese twins joined at the head probably thirty years ago. He grew up in a single parent home in the inner city, was poor and a bad student. One day his mom figured out that watching TV all day wasn't going to get him anywhere, so she made him and his brother read two library books a week and submit to her book reports about them (even though she couldn't read, but her sons didn't know that!). He hated the idea, but grew to love it! Through those books he learned that the key to success in life was HIM, he studied his way out of poverty, and became a brain surgeon! It is a fascinating book (Gifted Hands), a great movie (Gifted Hands), and supports this idea to learn something new everyday (in fact I went to hear him speak when he came to our area (he is retired now and very outspoken on health care, education, and other political issues and is being asked to run for president!). He ended by challenging each of us to read something new for thirty minutes each day!  Off to work at the polls this morning- and in my down time learning about American history! :)  Hope you enjoyed dinner last night!  Love you!  CAY</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Josh, your Lita, at 81, is still learning new things everyday and that is what makes life interesting. If you stop learning or interested in the world around you pretty soon everything becomes boring (especially for old people) Also. the more you learn, the more you could help yourself or other people as well.  Writing is great and sometimes when your ideas, of what you want in life, are not clear, write everything down and read them many times, that helps.My experience is that, having to many things on your plate at the same time is not a good idea because you are not able to concentrate  and do each thing right, all is done half way. Like I say, that is my experience, probably some people could do it but I doubt it. Start something and finish it, then proceed to the next.  Que tengas un buen dia!!!</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>I'm not surprised at all that you're still learning things, Lita! It's the best way to keep the world interesting!
I could not agree more about limiting the things on your plate. I'm actively trying to focus on just a few things, and it's so hard, but if I don't, I just waste time on a bunch of little, insignificant things. </p>
<p>Te amo mucho!</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>"A delicate mix of chess... and bear wrestling"</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/11/02/a-delicate-mix-of-chess-and-bear-wrestling</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last few weeks I've found myself needing to break down "why" of sport climbing (I'll refer to sport as "lead" climbing from here on out. Sorry, trad climbers).
If someone is enjoying top roping, (or bouldering) why should they take on the work of learning to lead climb, lead belay, and then deal with all the mental baggage that accompanies said switch.</p>
<p>Could you come up with more than ten reasons for someone to do start leading?</p>
<p>Here's my list:<!--more--></p>
<ul>
<li>Increase the challenge of climbing</li>
<li>Climb overhanging lines</li>
<li>Improve your overall abilities (resting, pacing, "flow")</li>
<li>Your friends lead climb, and you want to be like them.</li>
<li>You want to be a better climber, and good climbers seem to all lead climb</li>
<li>You don't want to have to walk to the top of the cliff again to set up a TR!</li>
<li>You want to avoid feeling like you're "holding back" friends that lead climb.</li>
<li>You think (for some reason) that big falls look exciting (and intimidating)</li>
<li>Every picture/video of any top climber (if they're using a rope) shows leading. Alex Honnold doesn't count.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, what may be the most compelling reason:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leading is a logical and necessary next step to improving your climbing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Honestly, I'm still struggling to build a case for leading. I'll just leave it at this - a segment of the general population climbs rocks (it's hard to say why). A segment of that population of climbers lead. They (you) don't need any convincing, they just do.</p>
<p>Isn't this line of reasoning similar to why we climb anyway? Explaining rock climbing to a non-climber is not as easy as you might think.</p>
<p>The academic "I enjoy the mental and physical challenges associated with this sport" both 1) applies to almost anything (golf, beach combing, unicycling) and 2) doesn't quite explain why you'll drive 12 hours to scare the living snot out of yourself just to get to the top of a piece of rock via one method rather than another.</p>
<p>Why do we rock climb and not hike, or run, or ride a bike? Why do we spend the money and time and blood, sweat, and tears, on this pursuit?</p>
<p>These are compelling reasons to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have pretty poor hand-eye coordination, and rock moves slow enough for most of us to catch it (Applies to just me? ok, then.)</li>
<li>Some of us are too short/small for football and basketball.</li>
<li>We usually enjoy the thrill of difficult moves high in the air</li>
<li>Climbers like being able to be delicate and graceful, without having to get into ballet or dance (but there is plenty of overlap between those activities and climbing)</li>
<li>We enjoy the overlap between thinking hard and trying hard. (A friend calls climbing "a delicate mix of chess... and bear wrestling")</li>
<li>We get to see things that we wouldn't otherwise see, and from perspectives we wouldn't otherwise get.</li>
<li>It's <em>extremely</em> motivating to see a return on investment of all the work and time spent climbing</li>
<li><strong>The community (as a whole) is encouraging, warm, and friendly.</strong></li>
<li><b>Our small group of climbing friends shares a bond we wouldn't otherwise have.</b></li>
<li>Be it an "easy" top rope or surviving a multi-pitch epic in freezing rain - climbing brings us together in a way that our day-to-day would <em>never</em> do. Similar to how boot camp builds bonds in soldiers, suffering together, working together, encouraging each other, and keeping each other alive (you do that when you belay - did you know that?) builds bonds.</li>
<li>Participating in a sport where you would die if you made a serious mistake sort of makes you feel alive. (Nor sure what this says more about: climbing, or the people who identify with this as a reason for climbing.)</li>
<li>Climbing is "easy" in terms of participation. The gear takes up minimal space (all my climbing gear fits in a single medium-sized plastic bin) and is easy to transport. (Kayaks, anyone?) Anyone can put up a hangboard and have an effective training tool. "Practicing" skiing away from a mountain, in the off season, seems a bit harder.</li>
<li>Climbing gyms. Lets be honest - as much as our community "discusses" proper gym-climbing ethics, grades, what people should/should not wear in the gym, setting, reachy and dynamic and "unfair" moves, sexism, tape vs. colored routes, and all that other stuff - we all care so much because we love our local climbing gym. The people there represent so much to us. I would not be a happy camper if I lost that community.</li>
<li>We love being able to get stronger, more technically proficient, or more mentally "strong", and all of those can improve our climbing.</li>
<li>We love being able to all participate in the same event, even if we climb at different levels. If I go for a run with my much stronger running friend, he'll leave me in the dust well before he finishes his 40 mile run. (Not kidding about the distance.) When we climb, no matter how big or small a difference in our climbing abilities, we can each find good routes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Phew. That's a lot of reasons, but I <em>still </em>think this is missing the point.</p>
<p>I turned to Google to solve this existential question. Here's the best I could find.</p>
<p>Question: Why climb?</p>
<p>Answers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because it's there</li>
<li>Because I can</li>
<li>Because it's good for me</li>
<li>Because it is "real" (raw, primal, etc.)</li>
<li>For the mental challenges</li>
<li>For the sense of accomplishment</li>
<li>To get exhausted</li>
<li>Because I must</li>
</ul>
<p>The above answers apply to many sports. Not just climbing. So, I'll close with this quote from George Mallory:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you have to ask the reason why...you won't understand the answer.</p></blockquote>
<p>There you have it - a completely non-conclusive reason for lead climbing, and climbing in general.</p>
<p>Why do you climb?</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Your "Community" Should Not Be Local</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/10/06/your-community-should-not-be-local</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Kristi and I were planning our move from Maryland to Colorado, the biggest challenge we anticipated was no longer being a short drive away from my sister, <a href="http://jenniferdthompson.com/">Jen</a>, and Kristi's brother, <a href="https://twitter.com/busterkeaton">Richard</a>. There are a few reasons, however, that we decided the benefits of moving outweighed the costs.
<h2>Your Community is Critical (Even if you don't think it is)</h2>
<p>First, it is not an option for us to be without these relationships. (There are a few other dear friends in our lives, but I'll get to that in a minute.) Even when we were in Maryland, we had to be intentional to spend quality time with Jen, Richard, and others. Why be intentional? We want to surround ourselves with people that encourage us to strive, in all areas of our lives, for more. I firmly believe that <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5926309/how-the-people-around-you-affect-personal-success">we will be the average of our five closest friends</a>, so it's important to choose wisely.</p>
<p>These relationships are critical to Kristi and I not because they're fun (they are) but because we can be vulnerable and open within these relationships. It takes work, and trust, to build that vulnerability into a relationship, and once it's there, we're not about to let it go.<!--more--></p>
<h2>Your Community Does NOT Need to be Local</h2>
<p>The very thing that makes these relationships significant is the thing that allows them to be relatively unaffected by distance and time zones. The vast majority of the time I spoke with Jen or her new husband Andrew was on the phone. It doesn't matter if I'm ten minutes away or 22 hours away - they are all just a phone call away.</p>
<p>The intentionality is still there, but now, instead of someone driving to someone else's house for dinner, we call them on Skype. If anything, we're even more intentional in our friendship with this distance. We've found a few good friends, and to us, it doesn't really matter where in the world they are. If they moved or we do, the relationship continues unchanged.</p>
<h2>Who is Your Community?</h2>
<p>If you could fast-forward to the end of your life, and knew that you'd be the average of your five closest friends, who would you choose to be those friends? Would you be happy with that average, or disappointed?</p>
<p>Of my closest friends, if I were to end up as the average of them, I'd be thrilled. I've been blessed with a small group of smart, hard-working, vulnerable men who invest in me regularly. To me, this group of friends is worth more than any job or accomplishment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Good thoughts. I would argue that at least one of those 5 SHOULD BE local. Why? A few reasons, but the biggest one being that it is easy to hide our true selves from those are are not geographically close to use.  It is not as easy when we have someone we trust that we will regularly bump into. Intentionally or unintentionally we continually put our best foot forward. This is part of the human condition, and even the closest of friends are not immune.I'd love to hear your thoughts on this and what to do when the intentionality of long-distance friendship wanes.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>A little bit of slope makes up for a lot of y-intercept</title>
      <link>/blog/2015/6/25/a-little-bit-of-slope-makes-up-for-a-lot-of-y-intercept</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The following is recounted on&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-profound-life-lessons-from-Stanford-Professor-John-Ousterhout">Quora</a>:</p><h1>A little bit of slope makes up for a lot of y-intercept</h1><p><br />From a lecture by <a target="_blank" href="http://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/home.php">Professor John Ousterhout</a>:<br /><em>Here's today's thought for the weekend. &nbsp;A little bit of slope makes up for a lot of Y-intercept. &nbsp;</em></p><p><em>[Laughter]</em></p><p> </p>

      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/558ca9b4e4b0391692169928/1435281858196/y-intercept.pngy-intercept?format=original" alt=""/>


<p><em><span style="font-size:15px">So at a mathematical level this is an obvious truism.&nbsp; You know if you have two lines, the red line and the blue line and the red line has a lower Y-intercept but a greater slope then eventually the red line will cross the blue line.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:15px">And if the Y-axis is something good, depending on your definition of something good, then I think most people would pick the red trajectory over the blue trajectory (..unless you think you're going to die before you get to the crossing point).</span><br /><br />[Laughter]<br /><br /><span style="font-size:15px">So in a mathematical sense it's kind of obvious.&nbsp; But I didn't really mean in a mathematical sense, I think this is a pretty good guideline for life also.&nbsp; What I mean is that how fast you learn is a lot more important than how much you know to begin with.&nbsp; So in general I say that people emphasize too much how much they know and not how fast they're learning.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:15px">That's good news for all of you people because you're in Stanford and that means you learn really, really fast.&nbsp; This is a great advantage for you.&nbsp; Now let me give you some examples.&nbsp; The first example is: you shouldn't be afraid to try new things even if you're completely clueless about the area you're going into.&nbsp; No need to be afraid about that.&nbsp; As long as you learn fast you'll catch up and you'll be fine.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:15px">For example I often hear conversations the first week of class where somebody will be bemoaning, "Oh so-and-so knows blah-blah-blah, how am I ever going to catch up to them?"&nbsp; Well, if you're one of the people who knows blah-blah-blah it's bad news for you because honestly everyone is going to catch up really quickly.&nbsp; Before you know it that advantage is going to be gone and if you aren't learning too you're going to be behind.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:15px">Another example is that a lot of people get stuck in ruts in their lives.&nbsp; They realize they're in the wrong job for them.&nbsp; I have the wrong job or the wrong spouse or whatever…</span><br />[Laughter]<br /><span style="font-size:15px">And they're afraid to go off and try something new.&nbsp; Often they're worried, I'm going to really look bad if I go..</span><br />[Laughter]<br /><span style="font-size:15px">I'm kidding about the spouse.&nbsp; But, seriously people will be afraid to try some new thing because they're worried they'll look bad or will make a lot of rookie mistakes.&nbsp; But, I say, just go do it and focus on learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />[Laughter]<br /><span style="font-size:15px">Let me take the spouse out of the equation for now.</span><br />[Laughter]<br /><span style="font-size:15px">Focus on the job.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:15px">Another example is hiring.&nbsp; Before I came back to academia a couple of years ago I was out doing startups.&nbsp; What I noticed is that when people hire they are almost always hire based on experience.&nbsp; They're looking for somebody's resume trying to find the person who has already done the job they want them to do three times over.&nbsp; That's basically hiring based on Y-intercept.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:15px">Personally I don't think that's a very good way to hire.&nbsp; The people who are doing the same thing over and over again often get burnt out and typically the reason they're doing the same thing over and over again is they've maxed out.&nbsp; They can't do anything more than that.&nbsp; And, in fact, typically what happens when you level off is you level off slightly above your level of competence.&nbsp; So in fact you're not actually doing the current job all that well.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:15px">So what I would always hire on is based on aptitude, not on experience.&nbsp; You know, is this person ready to do the job?&nbsp; They may never have done it before and have no experience in this area, but are they a smart person who can figure things out?&nbsp; Are they a quick learner?&nbsp; And I've found that's a much better way to get really effective people.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:15px">So I think this is a really interesting concept you can apply in a lot of different ways.&nbsp; And the key thing here I think is that slow and steady is great.&nbsp; You don't have to do anything heroic.&nbsp; You know the difference in slopes doesn't have to be that great if you just every day think about learning a little bit more and getting a little bit better, lots of small steps, its amazing how quickly you can catch up and become a real expert in the field.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:15px">I often ask myself: have I learned one new thing today?&nbsp; Now you guys are younger and, you know, your slope is a little bit higher than mine and so you can learn 2 or 3 or 4 new things a day.&nbsp; But if you just think about your slope and don't worry about where you start out you'll end up some place nice.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:15px">Ok, that's my weekend thought.</span><br /><br />[Applause]</em></p>]]></content:encoded>
      <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here's today's thought for the weekend. &nbsp;A little bit of slope makes up for a lot of Y-intercept. &nbsp;</p><p>So at a mathematical level this is an obvious truism. &nbsp;You know if you have two lines, the red line and the blue line and the red line has a lower Y-intercept but a greater slope then eventually the red line will cross the blue line.</p><p>And if the Y-axis is something good, depending on your definition of something good, then I think most people would pick the red trajectory over the blue trajectory (..unless you think you're going to die before you get to the crossing point).</p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

      <title>So you want to work remotely...</title>
      <link>/blog/so-you-want-to-work-remotely</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, I met a fantastic guy who is contemplating next steps for work. He is great at what he does, and is thinking about what direction to go in his life. He's young, and thought working remotely sounded pretty cool. I agreed, and then spent the next week or two thinking about what's required to work remotely.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's the email I sent trying to explain all of this.</p><p> </p><blockquote>Hi {redacted},</blockquote><blockquote>Prepare yourself for a long email. I’ve had a lot of thoughts rolling around my head related to this, and you’re getting them all. I’m going to work on cleaning this up and maybe sticking it online as a blog post for later. I’ve talked with many people about working remotely, so… here are some thoughts:</blockquote><blockquote>Glad you got the bug for remote working!</blockquote><blockquote>There’s lots of good things that come with working remotely, but there are lots of real and perceived barriers.</blockquote><blockquote>So, let me offer some more encouragement and advice.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>First, there’s the matter of framing how you go about working remotely. Obviously you want to work remotely, but put yourself in the shoes of a prospective employer. They don’t care if you work remotely or not - they want you to do great work for them and make them an effective, profitable organization.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>So, if I can make up the imaginary “Josh’s Rules of Getting a Remote Job”, this is what they’d be:</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Rule 1: Getting a remote job is exactly the same as getting a regular job, but a little harder</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Companies that hire remotely tend to be younger, agile-er, and smaller. So every employee matters. Making a bad hire can be catastrophic in terms of <a href="http://resources.dice.com/report/the-cost-of-bad-hiring-decisions/">money</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">opportunity cost</a>. Your job is to make it very, very obvious that hiring YOU is a great decision. In fact, you want to be so good at what you do that passing up on you is a <em>terrible</em>&nbsp;decision.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>This right here is the difference in mental approaches from an “average” job hunter and a high-performing job hunter.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>The average person talks about all the reasons that they’re qualified to do the work, how quick they are to learn, how happy they are for the opportunity, etc. None of this puts a CEO/hiring manager/team lead at ease.&nbsp;<em>Of course this person wants to work at my company. I have a kick-ass, quickly growing company and pay my employees well. I need more than a willing person.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Rule 2: A top-performing employee approaches a job opportunity the same way a consultant approaches a possible gig.</strong></blockquote><blockquote>First, qualify the opportunity. Is this something that you could do well?</blockquote><blockquote>Next, assuming it’s a job they could do well, get into “proposal” stage.&nbsp;“If I were hired to do this job, these are the things that I would do, these are the projects I would work on, and here’s the impact it would have on the company’s bottom line.”</blockquote><blockquote>^When you can walk someone down the path from “Hire me” to “I’ll help you make $$$/year more than you would otherwise”, if $$$ is 5x your annual salary, you’re in a pretty good place. All of a sudden, rather than the risk being “hire this guy and it might not work out” it becomes “If I don’t hire this guy, I might miss this opportunity”.</blockquote><blockquote>AND! By framing the conversation like this, you’re showing that you are aware of their needs as a business, and that you’ll hit the ground running. You don’t need your hand held, you’re able to execute ideas as appropriate.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>By the way - none of this is making up BS. There's tons of ways you can make contributions to a company and help them retain users, get new users, save money, earn more money, grow accounts, bring in new business, hire better people, keep existing employees longer, etc. This is another topic for another time, though. Just know that you need to focus on the value you provide to a company.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Rule 3: A top-performing employee has concrete numbers and stories showing their skill.&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><blockquote>You’ll be asked about your prior experience at your current job. Don’t just say “I did {job} at {company}”. That’s boring. That makes you a risky hire.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>You’ll say something like “When I was a {position} at {company}, I was tasked with {responsibility}. Not only did I do that task well, but I took on a few side projects to increase the effectiveness of the team, and decrease the friction of some processes. For example… {story showing how you made improvements that impacted the business, with figures to back it up}."</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Rule 4: Your online persona is the primary thing that will get you hired. Craft a good one.&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><blockquote>When you see a job opportunity go by, you don’t just submit a resume and let it go. You find the person in charge of hiring, or someone on the team, or the company CEO, and you send them a short email. In that email, you make it easy for them to discover how competent and skilled you are.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>That could be as simple as a link to your personal website in your signature. A personal website is extremely useful for showing a lot of things at once:</blockquote><blockquote>1. Tech savvy (it is simultaneously extremely complicated and unbelievably easy to set up a personal website. With a little googling, you can do it. This is good. Try to get <a href="http://firstnamelastname.com/">firstNameLastName.com</a>. If not, look for <a href="http://firstname.com/">firstName.com</a>, firstNameLastName.io, firstName.io,&nbsp;<a href="http://firstnamelastname.is/">firstNameLastName.is</a>, etc. Look around. Find people that have strong personal brands, see what their URL is, and try to get that.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>2. Room to show that you can communicate effectively. Remote companies live and die on the written word. Can you communicate something interesting via text? What do you write about? It doesn’t matter, as long as you might be helping someone. Before you publish anything, answer this question:&nbsp;“Does what I’m about to publish have the potential to help someone?”</blockquote><blockquote>If the answer is yes, publish.</blockquote><blockquote>3. Showcase your non-writing skills. Do you put cool stuff on Instagram and Twitter? Well, put those on your personal website. Do you read a lot? Make book recommendations and include a reason or two for why someone should read the book. Are you athletic? There’s ways to show that too.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>4. The skills required to work remotely tend to overlap heavily with the skills required to create a website.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">Software is eating the world</a>, so get conversant in the technology.</blockquote><blockquote>5. You don’t have to go full web-developer to put a website online, just as you don’t need to be a software engineer to work at a software company. But know the tools available to you that allow you to be effective at technical tasks. The idea behind using <a target="_blank" href="http://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a>&nbsp; or <a target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a>&nbsp;to publish a website is the same as using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kissmetrics.com/">KissMetrics</a>&nbsp;or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fullstory.com">FullStory</a>&nbsp;to gather customer data.</blockquote><blockquote>Phew. That’s it for now.</blockquote><blockquote>-Josh</blockquote><blockquote>PS All of this is general advice. You’ll need to become a specialist. That’s <em>hard work</em>. Holy crap, it’s hard. That is a whole other topic. But this is maybe a helpful starting point.</blockquote><blockquote>Want to soak in the wisdom of experts? Use <a href="https://feedly.com/">https://feedly.com</a>&nbsp;to subscribe to the websites of people that seem to know what they’re talking about.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>Read what they think about things, and you’ll be wiser for it. :)</blockquote><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Fry Your Pizza</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/04/03/fry-your-pizza</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here's a problem many of us first-worlders have: cold pizza.
There are two options. Microwave it, or throw it in the toaster oven or regular oven. A microwave makes it soggy, and a regular oven takes <em>forever</em> to heat it up.</p>
<p>(If you're willing to eat it cold, may god have mercy on your soul.)</p>
<p>Well, there's a solution to this problem. Here's how it works.</p>
<ol>
<li>Before you get your pizza out of the microwave, throw your skillet on the burner, medium heat.</li>
<li>Microwave your pizza for 45 seconds or so, until it's warm.
- This is the important part-</li>
<li>Place your pizza on the skillet</li>
<li>Cook it until it's crispy on the bottom</li>
</ol>
<p>This process is very quick. If you're lucky enough to have a gas range, it will add about two minutes to your 45 seconds of microwave time. If you're forced to work with a regular electric oven, it'll take a while to get the skillet hot. Sorry.</p>
<p>Guess what I had for dinner?</p>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Thanks Josh for your tips on how to avoid eating cold pizza which, by the way, is very bad for your stomach. I don't like soggy pizza so when I do not want to wait for the toaster oven do its job, I use a regular frying pan or skillet as you said, and heat it up, it's done in no time at all. Mind you, this is for Lido's pizza with a very thin crust, for other pizzas it might take longer and as you suggested, warming it up in the microwave first, will do the job faster.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

Ten minutes! Comes out crisp! (I got this tip off the side of a pizza restaurant box, so you know it works!)CAY</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, apparently I send a lot of email about people trying to get cool jobs.

      <title>On Fables: Finishing up Antifragile</title>
      <link>/blog/on-fables-finishing-up-antifragile</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm cleaning up some notes I wanted to jot down over the last few weeks</p>

<p>Nassim Taleb, in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083DJWGO/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">Antifragile</a></em>, says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The great economist Ariel Rubinstein gets the green lumber fallacy - it requires a great deal of intellect and honesty to see things that way.
  Rubinstein refuses to claim that his knowledge of theoretical matters can be transalted - by him - into anything directly practical. To him, economics is like a fable - a fable writer is there to stimulate ideas, indirectly inspire practice perhaps, but certainly not to direct or determine practice. </p>

  <p>Theory should stay independent from practice and vice versa.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rubinstein's injunction that <em>theory should stay independent from practice</em> has two implications:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It is easy to confuse theory <em>about</em> an outcome and the <em>practice</em> that led to that outcome. We're all guilty of building narratives around events in our lives, both good and bad. Sometimes our narratives match reality, and sometime they don't.</p>

<p>It's important to realize that it is difficult to distinguish the two. Nassim referenced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile#Green_Lumber_Fallacy">the green lumber fallacy</a> in which a very successful commodity trader <em>didn't understand what the commodity was that he was trading</em>. (The trader thought that "green lumber" was lumber painted green, when it is actually just freshly cut lumber)</p></li>
<li><p>When we dispense feedback, advice, or judgement, we should be acutely aware that <em>we probably don't understand events nearly as well as we think we do.</em> </p></li>
</ol>

<p>If someone asks me how to rock climb better, I'll tell them things that I think have helped me climb better. I could be entirely wrong about what matters. For example, I have tiny little legs. Barely any meat on them. I've got an ideal strength to weight ratio right off the couch. Does it really matter how much time I spend hangboarding? Sure, but probably not as much as I think it does.</p>

<p>If I never displayed an aptitude for rock climbing, I probably would not be a rock climber. The aptitude was helped along by a genetic predisposition to have small legs. I never chose this, and am barely aware of it, so my advice to others should never be blindly trusted. This goes for anything related to jobs, money, hobbies, relationships, etc. I can't imagine how many important components of each of those I'm entirely ignorant of. </p>

<p>What I say is at best a story, a fable. I want to stimulate ideas, and perhapse indirectly inspire practice, but not direct or determine anyone's decisions. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Two Things That Are Helping Me (Finally) Learn Spanish</title>
      <link>/blog/2-things-spanish</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kristi and I are in Costa Rica for the month of January. We spent two months in Buenos Aires this summer. That means in the space of six months, I'll have spent three months in a Spanish-speaking country, yet <em>I've not made significant progress on my spanish</em>. </p>

<p>That's not to say I've made <em>no</em> progress, just that I have not made as much progress as I'd have liked. I've got a big list of excuses ready to go for why I didn't improve, but those are meaningless to you and I.</p>

<p>Two things made a difference for me slowly making progress in the language:</p>

<ol>
<li>Anki.app's Spaced Repition Software  </li>
<li>Memorizing only what I understood, but then <em>memorizing it well</em>.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="ankiapp">Anki.app</h4>

<p><a href="https://ankiweb.net">Anki.app</a> is "Spaced Repition Software". It just works. Here's others arguing it more persuaviely than I:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/shakira/">Benny Lewis (using Shakira to learn spanish)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sivers.org/srs">Derek Sivers (using SRS for programming)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/life-tips/how-to-never-forget-anything-ever-again-5481606b087a#.gtp7ymytw">Mattan Griffel: How to never forget anything ever again</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I accepted the premise that SRS works, but I made a stupid mistake. I downloaded someone elses spanish deck, and started memorizing it.</p>

<p>This was a mistake because I was trying to memorize a collection of disperate words not connected to my life. Hard to drum up motivation for that, and then I never had occasion to practice the words. </p>

<p>After a month in Buenos Aires, I threw away the downloaded deck and started building my own. It was tedious, and slow. Not because creating cards is tedious and slow (it is. Anki's User Interface leaves LOTS to be desired) but because I had to figure out a few things for every card:</p>

<ol>
<li>What was I trying to understand?</li>
<li>What didn't I understand about it?</li>
<li>How can I now understand this thing that I didn't understand before?</li>
<li>How can I distill this new understanding into a short card?</li>
</ol>

<p>I'd then create a "card", and add it to my deck. I know I'm doing it right when most of the cards feel easy, if I stop and think about it. As I see the same card again and again, I can recall the information quicker each time. </p>

<h4 id="memorizeonlywhatiunderstandandanoteoncircularreasoning">Memorize only what I understand (and a note on circular reasoning)</h4>

<p>So, when I came across a word I wanted to learn, like "dispertarse", I had to make sure I knew several things about this word:</p>

<ol>
<li>The meaning of the infinitive. (Dispertar = to wake up)</li>
<li>all the conjugations in the present tense (five conjugations)</li>
<li>meaning of the ending "-se" (reflexive singular, but I need to know all the reflexive conjugations, so that introduces another six individual verb endings, <em>at least</em>)</li>
</ol>

<p>So, "dispertarse" means "to wake oneself up" but to really understand it, I chose to build a web of understanding that touches on at least twenty individual data points. </p>

<p>The good news is once you've built a small web, it's way easier to expand it piecemeal. It's a heck of a lot of work building it the first time, but thats what I did, and it helped enormously. </p>

<p>This all felt a bit circular at first (and still does). I want to memorize only what I understand, but since I don't understand much, I'm doing rote memorization. I'm not discouraged, though. I know I'm attacking the problem from two directions, and I'll get it eventually.</p>

<p>A small win under "memorize only what I can understand" is that I feel happy to <a href="http://www.hackingchinese.com/is-your-flashcard-deck-too-big-for-your-own-good/">delete cards as I see fit</a>. If I have not learned the card, am not learning it well, and don't want to learn it, <em>why should I learn it?</em> </p>

      <title>2015: The year I didn't think much?</title>
      <link>/blog/2015-the-year-i-didnt-think-much</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I generally think that if I write what I am thinking about, I can think about it a lot better. Writing has a clarifying effect (or is it affect?) on thought.&nbsp;</p><p>If that's the case, I just didn't think much in 2015:</p>

<p>I'm not sure why I wrote so much less in 2015. Much of what was on my mind I was reluctant to publish, because most of my extra brain power revolved around travel.&nbsp;Kristi and I have been traveling full-time for the last six months, and I didn't feel like I wanted to be a travel blogger, or run around tooting my own horn.

I'm hoping that writing begets more writing, as I've started working on another project (<a target="_blank" href="http://climbersguide.co/"><em>The Climber's Guide</em></a>)&nbsp;and picking up occasional freelance writing projects.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm also dialing back whatever imaginary standards I had in my head about what I should and should not write. It doesn't matter. This is my corner of the website, I can put whatever I want on it. My theme is still <em>deliver value</em>&nbsp;via my words, but that doesn't limit me exclusively to guides about how to do stuff.&nbsp;</p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Learning Spanish: Conversation connectors</title>
      <link>/blog/learning-spanish-conversation-connectors</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm learning Spanish right now,&nbsp;<a href="http://josh.works/blog/2-things-spanish">as I've mentioned</a>. The bad news is I've been in some state of <em>learning spanish</em>&nbsp;for the better part of the last 15 years. My mom's parents came here from Paraguay, and so she and her siblings are all native Spanish speakers, plus their spouses. Family get togethers are usually conducted in Spanish.</p><p>So, I've heard it and have passing familiarity with it, though never owned the process of improvement until a few months ago. I also tend to feel tremendous guilt and embarrassment that I don't speak it well. So that's caused me to steer well clear of it. (Why face what's uncomfortable, amiright?)</p><p>Benny Lewis is my go-to inspiration for language learning. He argues that he has no special skill at language learning, but thanks to <a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/goldilocks/">wise studying</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/skype-language-exchange/">speaking the language</a>&nbsp;as quickly as possible, being <a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/mistakes-matter/">fearless about making mistakes</a>, and a bunch of other things, he's picked up seven or eight languages quite well. He has written <a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/author/benny/">so much</a>&nbsp;about language learning.</p><p>If he can do it, surely I can muddle my way through to comfort in one language. And if I can do that once, I can do it again with another language. Right?</p><p>So, for the last two weeks or so, I've been learning spanish <a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/shakira/">via Shakira</a>, using <a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/spaced-repetition/">Anki SRS</a>&nbsp;to master vocabulary and rules once I understand them. (I don't spend much total time in Anki every day, but I can snag a few minutes here and there, or as a break from other projects/work, and rack up quite a lot of time spent <em>effectively</em>&nbsp;memorizing)</p><h2>The newest addition to the toolkit: Conversation connectors</h2><p>Since I want to be able to <em>speak</em>&nbsp;the language, and not just have a collection of rules and vocab, I've been learning <em>conversational connectors</em>. I was inspired to do this after reading <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/fluentczech/conversationalintimacy">this post about a guy learning Czech</a>, so I've added <a href="http://www.memrise.com/course/396749/spanish-conversational-connectors/">this list of conversational connectors</a>&nbsp;to my Spanish vocab.</p><p>Already, I feel significantly more comfortable in Spanish. It's going well.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>On Money (again)</title>
      <link>/blog/on-money-again</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently I posted <a href="http://josh.works/blog/thoughts-on-money-from-2013">thoughts about money</a>&nbsp;I'd written from back in 2013.&nbsp;</p><p>Money is hard to write about, because there are many different ways we can approach it. It's easy to feel judged when someone does something with their money that I don't do with mine.</p><p>That all said, there have been some books, articles, and ways of thinking that represent an internally consistent approach to earning and spending money,&nbsp;<em>and </em>have aided me tremendously in my own thinking on money.</p><p>I want to explain this approach, and share these resources. Hopefully they'll spark some thought, and you can read more deeply as you see fit.</p><h2>Money is a function of time</h2><p>In a normal "go to work, earn money, and spend it on things" world (which is the world we all live in) money is a concrete representation of time.</p><p>If you get paid $20/hr at work, and you buy a $20 t-shirt, that t-shirt cost you one hour of work. If you earn $40/hr, that t-shirt now costs you 30 minutes of work.&nbsp;</p><p>Its easy to convert between an annual wage and hourly wage. Assuming someone works about 40 hours a week, for 50 weeks a year (two weeks vacation) if you earn $xx,000/year, to get to your hourly wage, remove the "thousands", and cut the first number in half.</p><p>$30,000/yr &gt; remove thousands &gt; $30 &gt; cut the first number in half &gt; 15. $30,000/yr = $15/hr.</p><p>$100,000/yr = $50/hr</p><p>$24.50/hr = $48,000/yr.</p><p>If you earn $25,000/year, a $8 burrito from Chipotle costs 40 minutes of your time.&nbsp;</p><h3>The good news is, this math is quite easy. The bad news is, this method overstates your earnings.&nbsp;</h3><p>Your hourly wage includes not just your income divided by hours that you work - it equals (your income - work related expenses) divided by (hours worked + hours spent preparing for/ recovering from work.)</p><p>So an effective hourly wage of $30/hr (or $60k/year) drops quickly once you take out taxes, monthly gas/metro fare costs, business-casual clothing budget, food purchased while at work, retirement contributions, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>The hours that you spend working are probably more than 40. You have to count your time traveling to and from work, prep time in the mornings, rest time in the evening, and the drinking you do on weekends to recover from the stress of work. Oh, and you don't work JUST 40 hours, anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>All this works together to drop your effective hourly wage from what's listed on paper to something lower than that. My first out-of-college job, when I did this math when I had a particularly bad commute, I was earning not much more than minimum wage. Oof.&nbsp;</p><p>It's miserable math to do, because your current effective hourly wage may be really, really low. The good news is you can quickly improve your effective hourly wage in two ways:</p><ol><li>Spend less time doing work-things (less prep in the morning, or leaving every day after 8 hrs instead of 9)</li><li>Spend less money on work-things.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>I'm paraphrasing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052MD8VO/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&amp;btkr=1"><em>Your Money or your Life</em></a>, which you should read. Here's a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/RKC0S5T9HHK36/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B0052MD8VO&amp;channel=detail-glance&amp;nodeID=133140011&amp;store=digital-text">good Amazon review</a>&nbsp;to whet your appetite.&nbsp;</p><h2>Money is not the goal. Options is (are?) the goal.</h2><p>Why spend all this time and effort on money? Doesn't that make me seem really materialistic, scared, and untrustworthy of my job, God, my family, etc?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Off the top of my head, my goal with money is "create margin".&nbsp;</p><p>What is margin?</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>Margin is the space between our load and our limits. It is the amount allowed beyond that which is needed. It is something held in reserve for contingencies or unanticipated situations. Margin is the gap between rest and exhaustion, the space between breathing freely and suffocating.</em></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1576836827/fwis-20">Richard Swenson</a></p><p>Margin is the thing that allows us to absorb surprises, enjoy rest, and basically do the things that make us happy.&nbsp;</p><h2>You want to be rich, but getting there is slow, boring, and un-sexy</h2><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CLT31D6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&amp;btkr=1"><em>The Millionaire Next Door</em></a>&nbsp;looks at many, many millionaires in the United States. Guess what? Most of them are indistinguishable from non-millionaires. They drive inexpensive used cars, live in modest houses, and work normal jobs.</p><p>They start by saving a certain percentage of their income, and over time, never save less, and try to save more. Since income generally rises with age, if you're saving 10% of your income at 25, if you avoid lifestyle inflation, by 35, you could be saving 30% or 40% of your income, without feeling like you're living like a pauper.&nbsp;</p><p>Lets say you're earning $40,000/year at 25 years old. 10% of that is $4,000/year saved. Over the next ten years, you get raises to $75,000. If you let yourself spend $52,000 (that's $1400/month more than you spent at $40k/year-10% savings) you would be saving $23,000/year. This is why avoiding lifestyle inflation is a BIG DEAL!</p><h2>Friction will dictate most of your spending/saving habits. Don't fight it, use it.</h2><p>Money in your wallet wants to get spent, just as food in your refrigerator wants to be eaten. You know the rule "don't shop for groceries on an empty stomach"? This is because your willpower is affected by your emotional state.&nbsp;</p><p>I've got a "rule of thumb" that I follow, both in money and in food.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>Food: If I think I shouldn't eat an item of food, but it's easily available to me, I will eat it, and not spend willpower to resist it.<br /><br />Money: If I want to buy something impulsively, as long as I've budgeted for it, I'll buy it, and not spend willpower to resist it.</em></p><p>These rules may look insane, so here's the background:<br /><br />When getting groceries, Kristi and I almost never buy cookies/crackers/processed foods, and we don't drink soda.&nbsp;There are 21 meals in a week, and in a normal week, 20 of these meals are healthy, filling, and don't have much sugar. I "fight" for my diet in the grocery store. If I'm at a friends house and they have brownies, I'm loading up, because I know that the vast majority of the food I consume is healthy and good. There is <em>friction</em>&nbsp;to us eating poorly at home, because <em>unhealthy food doesn't exist in our house</em>. If it does, I gladly eat it, and feel no guilt. I follow the path of least resistance, and I'm fine with that.</p><p>Similarly, most of our finances are automated. Every time I get paid, a percentage of that money goes straight to retirement accounts. Every time I get a raise, that percentage goes up. It's difficult and time consuming to change that percentage, so unless we fell on very hard times financially, I will not ever decrease how much of my income goes to savings. There is friction between me and saving <em>less</em>&nbsp;money, so I follow the path of least resistance.</p><p><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004WL4BW6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">I Will Teach You To Be Rich</a>&nbsp;</em>opened my eyes to a whole new world. I read it right after I got married, and it heavily impacted me. (4.5 stars, 761 reviews.) I recommend you give it a read, and start thinking about how to apply that wisdom.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Friction cuts both ways. I've got some pending issues with our finances related to rolling over old retirement accounts that Kristi had in a prior job. I need to roll them into accounts that we manage, and then I need to get those accounts put under Vanguard. This all requires paperwork, and things that seem quite complex to me. So I've not done it. Remember - friction. I follow the path of least resistance.&nbsp;</p><p>But, once I get this done and the money in Vanguard, it will sit untouched for many years. And will grow. And this is good.&nbsp;</p><h2>Money is time, create margin, learn to love friction. Why does it matter?</h2><p>Why does this matter? Why save money?&nbsp;</p><p>Phew. Good questions. Others have said this better than me (I'll link out to the folks that inspire me below) but here is my perspective:</p><ul dir="ltr"><li>The difference between your income and your spending is related to how fragile you are to life changes. One who spends 100% of their income as soon as the paycheck clears is in a different spot from someone who has been saving 40% of their income for two years.</li><li>Spending less than you earn<em>&nbsp;</em>is a rejection of a lot of the unappealing part of our (USA)&nbsp;consumption-driven way of life</li><li>Saving money allows you to be generous to others when the opportunity arises.&nbsp;</li><li>Money isn't the point. Manage it well and with responsibility, and you can move on to other, more significant parts of life, like living.&nbsp;</li><li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill">Hedonic Treadmill</a>&nbsp;will suck all sense of happiness out of your life. Don't play that game.</li></ul><h2>Additional Reading</h2><ul><li><a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/02/22/getting-rich-from-zero-to-hero-in-one-blog-post/">Mr. Money Moustache</a>. Endlessly entertaining, a bit contrarian.</li><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/">r/financialindependence</a>. Lots of smart, motiviated people there will make this seem less crazy.</li><li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/">r/personalfinance</a>. Ditto.</li><li><a href="http://www.youneedabudget.com/learn">You Need A Budget</a>. This tool is a game changer. I actually <em>enjoy</em>&nbsp;managing money now. Whoa.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>This should get you a pretty comprehensive approach to a very non-traditional approach to money.</p><p>Good luck!&nbsp;</p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Circles of Influence</title>
      <link>/blog/circles-of-influence</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was listening to a podcast today, where they said if you have problems knowing what to write about, or you’ve hit a block, write about something that angers you.</p><p>This is easy. I could write about any number of things that we’ve all read in a newspaper, and get good and angry about that.&nbsp;</p><p>But I can’t do anything about it. If there is an event that we read about in a newspaper, it is, by definition, out of my circle of influence.</p><p>My circle of influence is pretty small. I live inside of it, as does my wife. Everyone else can pretty much choose if they want to be influenced by me.&nbsp;</p><p>By reading this, you’re becoming part of my circle of influence. You may choose to not be influenced by me, but you have to make that decision, you have to respond. So I’m influencing you.</p><p>The words on my screen are the extent of my circle of influence. I have thoughts, I jot them down on my computer, and hit publish. And you can then read them.&nbsp;</p><p>So, if you are inside of my circle of influence, how is it even remotely helpful for me to get angry about something and share it with you? That’s wasting both of our time.&nbsp;</p><p>I’d much rather use this opportunity to impart something of value to you.</p><p>So here’s a value-adding article for you: <a href="https://sivers.org/hsu">https://sivers.org/hsu</a> (He makes a case that you should aim to be happy, smart, and useful. Not just one or two of those things.)</p><p>-Josh</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>On Minimalism</title>
      <link>/blog/on-minimalism</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I reluctantly call myself a minimalist. I'd prefer to call myself an "enoughalist". </p><p>This reluctance is because I think the label brings in a bunch of connotations that I don't like.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-minimalism-">What is Minimalism?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>a removal or decluttering of one’s lifestyle in order to focus on that which is most essential</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is about reducing some things, like consumption, time at work, and possessions and increasing other things, like self-sufficiency, wealth, and {insert thing you want here}.</p>
<p>With the goal of... what? </p>
<p>Lets say you've got lots of things you <em>don't</em> want in your life, and not a lot of things you <em>do</em> want. This is a <em>bad place</em>. So, you adapt changes that reduce the things you don't want, and allow you to add some things you do want. </p>
<p>This is a <em>better place</em>.</p>
<p>There may still be a gap. If you've reduced things and added the things you wanted to add, but still feel discontent, you're in a spot that many others find themselves. This is a <em>good place</em>, because you have to own your discontentment. You can't play the "what if" game and say "if my boss wasn't so bad, and I had a little more money, and a little more time, I'd be happy." </p>
<h2 id="minimalism-is-a-tool-not-the-goal">Minimalism is a Tool, not the Goal</h2>
<p>Some internet-people make minimalism the goal of their lives. I respect them, but don't want to emulate them. People like <a href="http://tynan.com/">Tynan</a>, <a href="http://www.theminimalists.com/archives/#popular">The Minimalists</a>, and others. </p>
<p>Share good tools and tricks. (This is the premise of <a href="http://lifehacker.com">Lifehacker</a>, after all), but don't forget that the tips and tricks are to move you in the direction of a goal. (Speaking of useful tools, if you're a Mac user, check out <a href="http://jumpcut.sourceforge.net/">Jumpcut</a>.) </p>
<p>If minimalism is not the goal, why should anyone pay attention to it, or consider it?</p>
<p>Clearing out trivialities gives you space to evaluate your own life and decisions. The way you work, relax, spend money each involve a decision. If you don't make them consciously, you're probably having them made for you. So, adapt the basic tenants of minimalism (or "enoughism") and you can regain control of the decision making. </p>
<h2 id="what-s-the-goal-">What's the Goal?</h2>
<p>The good news: here's nothing in this world that is fully satisfying. </p>
<p>The bad news: we are slow to believe this. </p>
<p>Others have said it better:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Vanity of vanities", says the Preacher, "vanity of vanities! All is vanity. What does man gain by all the toil at which he toils under the sun?" (Ecclesiastes 1:2-3)</p>
</blockquote>

      <title>About working remotely at Litmus with Pajamas.io</title>
      <link>/blog/my-interview-with-pajamasio</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A while back, I wrote a long interview for <a target="_blank" href="http://pajamas.io/josh-thompson-litmus/">Pajamas.io</a>, a publication around remote work. I've pasted the entire article here below.</em></p><hr /><p><em>When Josh Thompson wanted to move out to rural Colorado with his family to be closer to the mountains he loves to climb, he knew finding a company that allowed him to work remotely would best suit his desired lifestyle. Luckily, Thompson found <a href="https://litmus.com/">Litmus</a>, a Cambridge, MA-based email marketing tools company that operates at least 50% distributed.</em></p><p><em>Thompson talks about the advantages of remote work for Litmus, how the company keeps everyone in sync, and why remote work works so well for him in the interview below.</em></p><p><strong>What does Litmus do and what is your role there?</strong></p><p>Litmus is a software company and we build tools to help our customers build, test, and track emails so our that person can spend less time building emails (it’s a surprisingly difficult thing to do well) and build better, more effective emails and campaigns. Our platform and analytics are used (via API) by notable companies like MailChimp, Campaign Monitor, Return Path, and many more.</p><p>I’m on the customer success team, so I handle inbound sales for our API, and handle all the renewals related to our annual accounts. Stuff moves fast at Litmus, so my job has (and will continue to) evolve, but that’s the simplest definition.</p><p><strong>How many people are at the company now and how spread out are you?</strong></p><p>About 42. Maybe 44? We hired four people in the last week, I think. [<a href="https://litmus.com/careers">And we're still hiring</a>] - ping me if you’re interested in applying. We’re always on the hunt for great people, even if there is not currently an open role. Oh, and we’re a <a href="https://litmus.com/blog/were-a-2014-best-places-to-work-winner">2014 Best Place to Work winner</a>. ;)</p><p>Most of the remote employees are spread across the US, with another group spread across the UK, and individuals also in Canada, Ecuador, and Pakistan (one of our designers - he’s top notch).</p><p><strong>What initially drew you to remote work?</strong></p><p>Location independence. I started looking while living inside the DC beltway with an hour commute each way. I wanted to move to Colorado, and knew that remote work was the best way to make that happen. So I started looking for any and all remote job opportunities, and am thrilled to have found Litmus.</p><p><strong>How does Litmus keep the ~50% of the company that's remote feeling connected?</strong></p><p>Many things, but here are a few of the big ones:</p><ol><li><p>All company communication is in <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://bluejeans.com/">Bluejeans</a>, etc. Even the Boston office is often mostly empty, because so many staff work from home, so the default communication style assumes everyone is remote.</p></li><li><p>At least twice-a-year company meet-ups. We host an annual “Email Design Conference” in August, and an annual company meetup/retreat in March. Occasional smaller get-togethers sprinkled in, and I usually see at least a few people that I work with every three months.</p></li><li><p>Big company events often take place in giant video calls. Every potential hire does a “meet the team” call, where we bring them into the Boston office for a day (even if they’re flying in from quite far away) and then the entire company can jump on a video call with them. Our twice-a-month company meetings usually take place with everyone in front of their computer, even for the folks in the Boston office.</p></li><li><p>The company was founded with remote work in it’s blood. Two of the three cofounders moved from London to Boston ten years ago to grow the business, so before they’d hired even two people, half the company was remote.</p></li></ol><p><strong>The office in Cambridge, MA sounds like an awesome place -- catered lunch and free snacks, weekly happy hour, regular parties and outings, is there anything that Litmus does to make the remote members of the team feel more included? How do you avoid creating a "two-tiered" culture on the team where remote folks feel separate from their in-office colleagues?</strong></p><p>The office is pretty sweet, but even the staff in Boston often work from home. As you can imagine, traffic (even in good weather) is terrible, so there is a blanket “work from home whenever you want, but try to make it in every other thursday for company meetings if you can” policy. I.e., even us remote staff are usually in the exact same bucket as the non-remote staff.</p><p>Also, we don’t have an open-office floor plan. Most employees have their own office, or share it with one other person. This further ingrains the text-based communication.</p><blockquote> <p>We all live balanced lives, so when we’re at work we work hard to get shit done, but then we go home and do other stuff.</p></blockquote><p>Litmus goes all-out to make sure the remote staff have the same tools as in-office. Every employee gets top-of-line hardware, external monitors, and a good desk chair (if they don’t already have one.)</p><p>I’ll admit, sometimes I wish I could participate in some of the parties they throw in the office, but after I take my five-second commute to the other side of my living room, and grab my gear to head out rock climbing in Colorado, I don’t miss being in Boston too bad.</p><p><strong>How would describe the company culture at Litmus? Is it harder to build cohesive culture when half the company is spread out and the other half is in one place?</strong></p><p>Culture is extremely inclusive. We’re growing quickly, so those questions will inevitably stay top of mind, but again, because the remote work policy is so ingrained even in the home office, we are all functionally working remotely. (Some days there are only two or three people in the office. Last winter, there would be weeks where NO one made it into the office!)</p><p>As far as cohesive culture, I think the average age at Litmus skews a bit older than what may be assumed for a software company (plenty of our employees have kids) so there’s not much of a “go-out-for-drinks-after-work” attitude, anyway. (Except when the whole company is together in Boston for our conference. That week has much more drinking than normal.)</p><p>We all live balanced lives, so when we’re at work we work hard to get shit done, but then we go home and do other stuff. It’s very professional, and very friendly.</p><p><strong>Do you ever feel like you lose something because you're not working in the office every day?</strong></p><p>I’ve lost my commute, and I do really enjoy the casual conversation that happens around lunch or when walking around the office, but I don’t think I’m missing anything irreplaceable, or that cannot be had in a remote work situation.</p><p><strong>Personally, what are the biggest challenges you face working remotely and how do you overcome them?</strong></p><p>There are certainly challenges.</p><ol><li><p>I thrive off of external affirmation, and I love being able to show how hard I work. In an office you can be the first one in and last one out, but, besides not being healthy, that doesn’t actually correlate with getting work done. So, because I can’t telegraph how hard I work, I have to show how much I get done, but sometimes (often!) I don’t feel like I’ve gotten as much done as I had hoped. Projects grow in complexity, or I’ll have spent half the day on the phone.&nbsp;<br /><br />So, I’ve had to set up fairly regular official performance evaluations with my manager, just so I convince myself that I’m actually doing good work. So far, all those reviews have been extremely positive, but I always have a sneaking suspicion that I’m failing somehow. This is specific to me and my disposition, so everyone reading this is either nodding along in understanding, or cannot understand this at all.</p></li><li><p>I don’t have external signals/environments that signify “work time.” I have to rigorously control my work environment so I can get in the zone and work well. I use a mix of writing down my projects for the day (and the things I’ve accomplished) to keep me on task, using a Pomodoro app to work in chunks, and sometimes<a href="http://selfcontrolapp.com/">SelfControl</a>&nbsp;to kill Reddit/Hacker News/Twitter to help avoid those distractions.</p></li><li><p>I don’t have those signals that signify “not working.” I don’t have a commute home to think about work or other things. I just type in Slack “heading out, have a good night.” and... work is done. Sometimes I’ll take a walk, but sometimes I just try to jump right into prepping dinner or doing non-work stuff. If work was stressful, this stress carries over to home. My wife is really good at identifying if I’m a little off and helping me decompress.</p></li></ol><p><strong>On the other hand, what are the biggest benefits to working remotely?</strong></p><p>Phew. So many.</p><ol><li><p>I don’t commute anymore. There’s two hours a <em>day</em>&nbsp;back. (And a lot of gas and money in maintenance.) I was stuck in traffic earlier today (on a weekend) and was so <em>frustrated</em>&nbsp;by it. I don’t ever have to deal with rush hour.</p></li><li><p>My wife and I now own only one car. That saves a lot of money.</p></li><li><p>We moved to Colorado. I loved every minute in Colorado.</p></li><li><p>Our landlord wanted to move into our apartment, so we had to leave, and my wife stopped teaching, so we headed to Buenos Aires for two months, then have been traveling around the east coast, following the climbing, and spending time with dear friends.&nbsp;<br /><br />We spent three weeks working in rural West Virginia, and I’d enjoy world-class climbing after work and on the weekends. I’m about to drive to Kentucky for more world-class climbing for three weeks. I used to drive between six and eight hours on the weekend to do this. Now I just drive 3 mins to the rock. Rent is cheap out in the boonies, too.</p></li><li><p>My work is made more effective. Without all the office politics and micromanaging that infects most offices, I have tons of responsibility and freedom to do the best job I know how to do, and to experiment <em>a lot</em>&nbsp;with how to make things even better. This speaks as much of working remotely as it does of the specific culture of the leadership team at Litmus, but they go hand-in-hand. If you cannot trust your staff to work remotely, you won’t trust them in an office either. If you can trust them to work remotely, you’ll trust them to do good work without you breathing down their neck.</p></li></ol><p><strong>What do you think is the most important thing a distributed team can do to ensure successful collaboration?</strong></p><p>I love meeting the team in person (or, when we add someone to the team, I’ll catch them on a video call for 20 or 30 mins just to talk and get to know each other). Knowing the personality and lives behind that little profile picture on Slack makes the communication so much richer. We all have inside jokes, memes, and a rich history of communication that makes the more context-free text-based communication work.</p><p>So, time in person is even more important when you work remotely. I think. But I’m not wise enough to know The One Thing (TM) that matters.</p><p><strong>What are some of the benchmarks Litmus uses to make sure the team is in a good place, both mentally and operationally?</strong></p><p>I meet weekly with my manager to make sure I’ve got all the tools and resources I need for whatever projects I’m working on.</p><p>We have flexible work hours, and generous paid time off policies. (If we went with “unlimited” vacation time, no one would take enough time off, so instead we get about six weeks paid vacation off a year, and it doesn’t roll over, so you have to use it.)</p><p>Every new employee gets new top-of-line hardware, monitor, peripherals, and anything else we might need. We all have company cards that we’re encouraged to use as needed. I’m not hampered by a lack of tools or equipment or rest at all.</p><p><strong>Are there any specific qualities that make someone more successful at working remotely?</strong></p><p>The same qualities that make someone successful in an office apply to working remotely. You’ll need to be a “self-starter,” and have a lot of initiative. I think a good proxy for both of these traits is side-projects, or side-hustles. If two people are equally qualified for a role, but one of them has a good side project/hobby that they’re passionate about, they will get the job. The primary reason I got my current job was because I had side projects (aka “public proof”) that demonstrated my drive and initiative.</p><p>I don’t have someone breathing down my neck to get work done, so for better or worse, I alone am responsible for the work that I do.</p><p>PS: I know it can be discouraging to read something like that, so if you just said to yourself “well, of course its easy to get a job with a cool side project” here are two “words of encouragement:"</p><ol><li><p>Your side projects do not need to be beautiful and graceful. Some of my side projects are ugly as sin:<a href="http://joshworks.site44.com/">http://joshworks.site44.com/</a>, others less so:&nbsp;<a href="http://climbingweekly.co/">http://climbingweekly.co/</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://josh.works/">http://josh.works/</a></p></li><li><p>You don’t have to have a side project to have a side project. Just say “My hobby is finding a hobby” and start documenting your search for something worthy of your time and energy. For example, mine could be:&nbsp;<br /><br /><em>Josh’s Quest for a Side Project:</em>&nbsp;How I found something interesting to work on <br /><br />Or <br /><br /><em>Josh’s Epic Quest.</em>&nbsp;See <a href="http://www.nerdfitness.com/epic-quest/">Steve’s Epic Quest</a>&nbsp;or Jia Jiang’s <a href="http://fearbuster.com/100-days-of-rejection-therapy/">100 Days of Rejection</a>&nbsp;for inspiration.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Describe your personal work environment.</strong></p><p>In flux lately. For most of my time at Litmus I worked from a standing desk in my living room. I had an Apple Monitor, laptop stand, comfortable chair, etc. My wife and I have been “nomadding” these last few months, living out of our car, a few weeks at a time in a different place. So currently I’m down to just my laptop, no mouse, no external display, etc. I was on an ultra-minimalist kick for a while, but I think I’m ready to reintroduce a mouse and external keyboard into my life.</p><p>That’s the physical environment. Anytime I open my computer, I feel very at home. I have my machine quite configured to my liking, and I work well on it.</p><p>Here’s some key tools that make MY machine feel like home, and allow me to work in really any environment.</p><ul><li><a href="http://supportops.co/starting-with-text-expander/">TextExpander</a>&nbsp;(Stop typing the same thing over and over.

It’s easy to spend all day working, but when you do that, your efficiency goes way down. It’s hard for me to sometimes keep work to JUST those “normal” work hours, but it’s important for my own health and recovery to do so. My wife is really good at helping me see when I’m working too much.</p><blockquote> <p>The same qualities that make someone successful in an office apply to working remotely.

If I have told a friend I’ll meet him at a certain time at a certain place, I have a hard stop on my work, so it forces me to be extra efficient so I can stop at the appropriate time.</p><p><strong>How do you keep distractions to a minimum? How do you personally measure efficiency?</strong></p><p>I do a few things to stay focused. The easiest is to work in blocks. I love the Pomodoro technique, and try to fit my work into those 25 mins work/5 mins rest cycles. Invariably, something “breaks” the cycle, but a lot of work gets done in a few of those.</p><p>If I’m finding myself procrastinating, that’s usually an indicator that I need to break the work into smaller pieces. Large tasks are overwhelming, but less so when broken into small pieces.</p><p>I usually start my day with a notebook and a few minutes of thinking about what I want to accomplish for the day. I’ll then gear the pomodoros towards accomplishing those goals.</p><p><strong>What are some of the tools you couldn't live without as a remote company?</strong></p><p>Slack. Bluejeans/some sort of video calling tool. Basecamp, Trello,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>. Two factor authentication.</p><p><strong>What advice would you give to a company heading down the remote working path?</strong></p><p>If you’re thinking about “testing the waters”, you need to give it a fair shake. “Test” for a long time, and with all your employees. At least a month or two to iron out kinks, and plan on spending money.</p><p>When Litmus officially <em>tested</em>&nbsp;remote work for even the in-office folks, the company had to buy laptops for some employees, and a bunch of external monitors. We use the Apple Monitor, so that was probably at least $10-15k invested in the “experiment.”</p><p>The experiment worked out great, and this last winter when Boston (home office) was crushed by 120 inches of snow, work continued uninterrupted, even though roads and public transportation was almost completely unusable.</p><p>That $10-15k equipment expense resulted in three months of the entire company moving at full efficiency, rather than grinding to a halt in a really busy time of the year. Maybe the best investment we ever made!</p>]]></content:encoded>
      <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A while back, I wrote a long interview for Pajamas.io, a publication around remote work. I've pasted the entire article here below.</em></p><p><strong>What does Litmus do and what is your role there?</strong></p><p>Litmus is a software company and we build tools to help our customers build, test, and track emails so our that person can spend less time building emails (it’s a surprisingly difficult thing to do well) and build better, more effective emails and campaigns. Our platform and analytics are used (via API) by notable companies like MailChimp, Campaign Monitor, Return Path, and many more.</p><p>I’m on the customer success team, so I handle inbound sales for our API, and handle all the renewals related to our annual accounts. Stuff moves fast at Litmus, so my job has (and will continue to) evolve, but that’s the simplest definition.</p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

      <title>Everything I Do and Think I've Read in a Book (or, exploring the relationship between books and money)</title>
      <link>/blog/everything-i-do-and-think-ive-read-in-a-book-or-exploring-the-relationship-between-books-and-money</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here's yet another big post on money and income and saving and reading.&nbsp;I tried to write everything on my mind in one massive letter, so I could write a really detailed answer once, rather than a less-useful but less-thoughtful email that I can never reuse.</p><hr /><p>Hey there,</p><p>I'm enjoying our slowly-evolving conversation-by-text. Since we're many time zones apart, and I like to think and digest between texts, it's been a slow conversation.</p><p>We've "uncorked" two topics so far:</p><ul><li>Am I living on 50% of my income, per my stated goal last year?</li><li>"I read really slow" which I repackaged as "what's the 'break-even point' on reading to justify prioritizing it above other items in my life.</li></ul><p>The 50% of my income thing is a whole long thought on it's own, but I'll take a quick stab.</p><h2>Am I (Josh) living on 50% of my income?</h2><p>No. For two reasons.</p><ul><li><em>I</em> don't have <em>my</em> income. <em>We</em> have <em>our</em> income.</li><li>It's hard to track that exact percentage, so I don't know <em>what</em> percentage we're living on. I think it's about 65% of our income.</li></ul><h3>"My income" doesn't exist </h3><p>Kristi and I have 100% combined finances<em>, so it's </em>our* money. Not my money. For a few months last year Kristi was not working, and at no point did the thought pass through my head that she was not pulling her weight.</p><p>*For our sanity, we both have "fun money" budgets of about $100/month. We can spend it however we want, but it's to remove any guilt or justification around small purchases. I want to buy {frivolous thing}? Great. I've got fun money. Kristi wants to withdraw five $20 bills and light them on fire? No problem. It's her fun money.</p><p>It started as $50/month, and we've bumped it up a bit over the last two years.</p><p>The tool I use to track all of this is called "<a href="http://www.youneedabudget.com/learn">You Need A Budget</a>", and is worth every penny.</p><h3>I don't know the exact percentage that we're living on </h3><p>I've got 30% of my paycheck going to retirement funds, and have a 4% match from my employer, so before a paycheck lands in our checking account, 34% of that money has gone to savings. I earn about 2/3s of our household income, so that accounts for the first 17% household savings rate.</p><p>Beyond that, we've been putting money aside in our checking account, with the plan of investing it. The reason we have a lump sum of money sitting there is because of <em>friction</em>. I've not set up an automatic investment strategy yet with Vanguard, and it's a pain in the butt to do, so I've just not done that. This is bad, and writing these words makes me want to fix that.</p><p>What I do know, doing back of the envelope calculations, once you throw in all income/expenses and close one eye and squint the other, I think we're saving ~30% of our income every month. Maybe more</p><p>I still want to get to 50% saved, at least a few months this year.</p><blockquote>Cool, so you save a lot of money. What's that have to do with reading?</blockquote><h2>The relationship between money and reading</h2><p>Just about everything I think in the world I've gained from a book. <em>I don't have original ideas.</em> At best I might combine an idea about one thing with a new topic, and poof, it seems new. (To me, a coworker, a friend, et.) But it's really not new. It's the same old idea applied to a new thing.</p><p>Books are where you get the ideas to apply to new things.</p><p>The two big things that have helped us save a lot of money is "earn more" and "spend less".</p><p><em>I just spent a long time googling around for a good list of reasons to prioritize reading, and couldn't find any lists that I really liked.</em></p><p>I do not like the lists because the lists were all about reading books. I don't read books because I like to read, though I do enjoy it.<em> I read books because it's a small investment in my life. Reading is the quickest, most effective way to grow my knowledge, and who I am as a person.</em></p><p>Every book, fiction or non-fiction, is a tiny little addition to who I am as a person. Over time, those additions add up. Some books contribute more than others.</p><p>Reading feels like a delightful obligation I have to myself, my family, and those around me. Every bit of knowledge I glean or idea I have from a book can benefit me and Kristi, directly.</p><p>Here's a list of topics I've read about in the last year or so:</p><ul><li>Marriage</li><li>Relationships (with my wife, with God, with others)</li><li>Finances</li><li>Physical fitness</li><li>Happiness</li><li>Solitude</li><li>Mental fortitude/independence/self-control</li><li>Lots and lots of fiction. (I love sic-fi and fantasy, but read plenty of other fiction too)</li><li>Economics</li><li>Habit building/morning routines</li><li>Thankfulness</li><li>Money (again)</li><li>Autobiographies of accomplished people (the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FBFMHU/ref=x_gr_w_bb?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=x_gr_w_bb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000FBFMHU&amp;SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2">two</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316037702/ref=x_gr_w_bb?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=x_gr_w_bb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0316037702&amp;SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2">best</a> autobiographies I've read were written by felons-turned-consultants)</li><li>Relationship building (social skills, ways to add value, etc.)</li><li>How to build an audience</li><li>How to set healthy boundaries in your life</li><li>How to identify and pursue the "essentials"</li><li>How to roughhouse with kids</li><li>How to grow your career by doing better and better work</li><li>Happiness (again)</li><li>How to become an authority on a topic</li><li>How to charge more as a freelancer</li><li>How the food we eat impacts the world around us</li><li>More books about money</li><li>etc.</li></ul><p>I said a moment ago that reading feels like a delightful obligation? Why did I say <em>obligation</em>? Easy. If you boiled the themes of the above list down to just the basics, you could say that these books cover:</p><ul><li>ways I relate to others</li><li>ways I relate to myself</li><li>Ways I can deliver the most value possible for anyone who hires me, and in return can ask for a larger and larger piece of compensation.</li><li>Ways I can manage my resources (time, money)</li></ul><p>All of these themes are so important that anyone alive today would be well-justified to study these topics to learn more about them. By reading, you do just that.</p><blockquote>I get it. Reading is cool. You've STILL not tied this back to making phat stacks of cash</blockquote><p>Lets imagine Joe makes $40,000/year. Lets imagine that Joe gets a raise tomorrow and doubles his annual income. Good for him! What does he do now?</p><p>If Joe is average, his lifestyle inflates. He was living on $40k, but in six months, he'll be living on that full $80k. If he loses his job and has to go back to $40k/year, he'll quickly rack up big debt, because he's used to spending more.</p><p>On the other hand, if Joe makes $40k, but lives as if he makes $35k, and gets a raise to $80k, <em>and does not increase his spending</em>, he can start putting away $45k a year in the bank. Whoa.</p><p>Now, there's three things going on with this story:</p><ol><li>Joe starts earning more money</li><li>Joe keeps his life style from in flaring</li><li>Joe saves the extra money</li></ol><p>Each of these three topics is the subject of many books. Sometimes one book touches on all three, but usually not.</p><p>If "make more money", "don't spend it all", and "save the difference" is an appealing plan, the only option is to read. Online articles are not sufficient, though they are a great place to start.</p><blockquote>Blah blah blah, books books books. Fine, I'll read one. Can you make some recommendations?</blockquote><p>Sure. We'll start high level and go down from there:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Will-Teach-You-Be-Rich/dp/0761147489/ref=sr_1_1?">I Will Teach You To Be Rich</a> Super sketchy title, but at the end, you'll angrily say "How has no one told me this before?" before overhauling your financial life.</li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Slight-Edge-Turning-Disciplines-Happiness/dp/1626340463/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459404389&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+slight+edge">The Slight Edge</a> (about the long-term impact that trivial daily decisions can have. I.E. things that are <em>easy to do, but just as easy not to do</em>.) It's not specifically about money, but offers a very valuable framework for that kind of decision-making. Unfortunately, it does come across as self-helpy quite a bit, talking about how "readers of this book have changed their lives". I don't like that kind of stuff, but the content is quite good.</li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Your-Money-Life-Transforming-Relationship/dp/0143115766/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459404423&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=your+money+or+your+life">Your Money or Your Life</a> This book is sort of the bible of the "financial independence" crowd, and explains how it's possible to become financially independent without making millions. This gets into the "why" <em>and</em> the "how" of "make more money, avoid lifestyle inflation, save the rest."</li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fearless-Salary-Negotiation-step---step/dp/0692568689/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459404460&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=fearless+salary+negotiation">Fearless Salary Negotiation</a> Self-explanatory title. This is the "how to make more money" step in a very practical way.</li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Next-Door-Surprising-Americas/dp/1589795474/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459404512&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+millionaire+next+door">The Millionaire Next Door</a> A encouraging reality check - most millionaires in America don't look like millionaires. They drive used vehicles, they live modest lifestyles. This is exactly <em>how</em> they have become millionaires, and nothing changes when they cross that seven-figure line. Of course, a million dollars in 1980 is worth $2.8MM today (<a href="http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">Bureau of Labor and Statistics</a>), but it's still a nice round number to aim for.</li></ul><p>There's a starting point. I would argue that one could not read these five books and be unchanged by them. If you read ten minutes a day, you will finish, on average, one book a month. This is an excellent pace.</p><p>Pick the most interesting looking title, go order it from Amazon. (And, none of these are affiliate links. I don't do that, never will)</p><p><strong><em>Related</em></strong></p><ul><li><a href="http://josh.works/blog/thoughts-on-money-from-2013">Thoughts On Money from 2013</a></li><li><a href="http://josh.works/blog/on-money-again">On Money Again</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Be a little better at personal email</title>
      <link>/blog/be-a-little-better-at-personal-email</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The next bunch of posts will be me "clearing out the drawers" of notes I have scattered across my phone, computer, and brain. There is no unifying theme to what will be written here.</em></p><h1>Three recommendations to email better</h1><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl%3Bdr"><strong>TL;DR</strong></a> Email should usually be as short as possible. More of a text message than a letter.&nbsp;If an email isn't going to be one line (like a text) make it easy to skim, by using many line breaks.</p><p>If you need input from someone else to proceed, present a list of their options, and say "unless I hear otherwise, I'll do {option}." (source:&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://unlessiheardifferently.com/">unlessiheardifferently.com</a>)</p><p><strong>The Longer Version, AKA Don't read this paragraph</strong></p><p>I had a discussion with a friend a few months ago about "rules for email", or "email best practices". These "best practices" are all generally in the context of 1:1 email, or at most, one email to a small group. We all send and receive emails, and it may seem like it doesn't matter if you write good email. I used to think it didn't matter. Then I started emailing around when I was trying to get a job. Then I realized my email skills were EXACTLY what got me to a first interview at a company, or got a "thanks for your inquiry, but no thanks", or no reply at all. A short email I sent is exactly why I have the job I have today. I'll include some screenshots of early emails I sent in a later message. They are horrendous, extremely long tomes. I'd never send anything like that to a stranger these days. BUT! They were not complete wastes. I was trying to demonstrate my ability to deliver value to the person I was emailing, in regards to the job I wanted to do. This is a good goal to have, I just executed it poorly. Good email respects the reader, even if it is entirely devoid of pleasantries and flowery language. It is short and concise because important and busy people have a lot to do, and you want a sliver of their attention. A long email causes them to skip your email.</p><p><strong>You didn't even try to read that last paragraph, did you?</strong></p><p>I sure wouldn't have. Walls of text are terrible.</p><p>Here's the same paragraph, but with line breaks and unnecessary words removed:</p><blockquote>I had a discussion with a friend a few months ago about "rules for email", or "best practices for emails between individuals".</blockquote><blockquote>I never thought about my own email etiquette until I started emailing around when I was trying to get a job a few years ago. My email skills (or lack thereof) were EXACTLY what got me to a an interview at a company, or got a "thanks for your inquiry, but no thanks", or no reply at all.</blockquote><blockquote>My job today at Litmus is a direct result of a short email I sent, but I would have never gotten the job if I'd ignored the following "rules of email".</blockquote><blockquote>Good email respects the reader, even if it is entirely devoid of pleasantries and flowery language. A long email causes them to skip your message.</blockquote><p>Does that look a little better? Maybe you actually read it, huh?</p><p>Here's the best list of rules I can think of. Some of this applies more to emailing a peer, some of it fits more for emailing a "Very Important Person".</p><h3>Rule 1: Be concise</h3><p>Relentlessly strip away words, sentences, and paragraphs that are not critical. If you can't decide if it matters or not, it doesn't matter.</p><h3>Rule 2: Respect the time and attention of the reader.</h3><p>This can be done by:<br /><strong>Doing your research before emailing them</strong>. Have a question? Show that you've tried to find the answer on your own.</p><p><strong>Lead with the most important part of the email, provide additional context below.</strong> (This is known as a TL;DR, or "Too Long; Didn't Read)<br /><br /><strong>Create information hierarchy.</strong>&nbsp;Bold the important parts, assume the rest will be skimmed at best.</p><p><strong>Make it easy for them to give a one-word answer, or at most, a one-sentence answer. </strong>It's hard to write a question like this, but it's putting the burden on the person you're emailing to do it any other way.</p><p>Here's an example of a poorly phrased question (Imagine you're emailing a sponsored athlete, trying to learn how to become sponsored like them.)</p><blockquote>Hey {athlete},&nbsp;I'm trying to come up with same ways to get a sponsorship from {company}, and it seems like you've figured this out. What would you recommend I do?</blockquote><p>How would you even begin to respond to this question? If I were the athlete, I'd be annoyed that they didn't just <a target="_blank" href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+do+I+become+a+sponsored+athlete%3F+">google it</a>.</p><p>Here's a much better way to ask the same question:</p><blockquote>Hi {athlete},</blockquote><blockquote>I've been following you for a while, and have been impressed with how you've done {thing1} and {thing2}.</blockquote><blockquote>It looks like your path to sponsorship started with {beginning}, then on your blog 2 years ago {link_to_post}, you said you started sponsorship with {desired company}. I'm working towards a similar arrangement, and have a few options to proceed.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Which of the following makes the most sense to you?</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Option 1: </strong>Focus on growing my social media followers, while tagging the brands I want to get the attention by.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Option 2:</strong> Ignore social media for now, and focus on building relationships within the companies by attending trade shows, writing posts for their blog, etc.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Option 3:</strong> {some third option that you've discovered in your quest for a good answer}</blockquote><p>Even if none of the options are what the person recommends, he or she will probably say something like "A mix of option 1 and 3, but make sure you do {thing}."</p><p>When you've implemented their advice, you can reach out and tell them what you've done.

      <title>Save hundreds by being willing to spend $20</title>
      <link>/blog/save-hundreds-by-being-willing-to-spend-20</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you pack for a trip, you pack "just in case" items, right? Things that in a certain situation would be priceless. Think "umbrella" or "underpants".</p><p>But then you think of all the possible situations you might encounter, and you'll find your "just in case" items quickly outnumber (and outweigh)&nbsp;your "essentials" list.</p><p>(This applies equally to packing for travel, and just living in your house/apartment.)</p><p>I want to convince you to switch your thinking from "I <em>might</em>&nbsp;need this thing"&nbsp;to "Statistically, I will not need <em>this</em>&nbsp;thing, but I will need <em>a</em>&nbsp;thing, so I've planned accordingly."</p><p>There's a final, unexpected benefit to this thinking, too. I'll expand on that at the end.</p><h2>You cannot anticipate what you'll need, just that you will need something</h2><p>The problem is, of 20 items you'll need some day, you have no idea when that will be, and you're stuck caring for them, and storing them, and moving them, until that day.</p><p>Here's how to sidestep the problem:</p><p><strong>Give yourself permission to get rid of anything that you're on the fence about, if it can be replaced for $20 or less.</strong></p><p>You might choose to leave behind twenty items, and save yourself tons of time and frustration by getting rid of it, and then at the end, replace one or two items.</p><p>Now, what items should you apply this rule to? Well, obviously start with just that $20 price limit, and then apply it to anywhere you see an excess of items. It seems the top offenders here are:</p><ol><li>Closets with clothing acquired for free or cheap (get rid of that shirt you got from that 5k you ran a few years back, and that thing you bought because it was on sale.)</li><li>Kitchen utensils. It's hard rummaging around for that thing you use almost every day, when it's buried in with things you've not used for six months. Get rid of the stuff you don't use. Tape a $20 to your fridge, if you'd like, to symbolize your new line of thinking.&nbsp;</li><li>Tool chests/buckets/storage areas/garages/basements. We put things here that we don't need, and we know we don't need, we just think we *might* want them later.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>I can provide two examples:</p><ol><li>Kristi and I are traveling, and went to see an orchestra. We've been living out of small backpacks for two months, and had no formal attire. The orchestra was formal-ish, but Kristi didn't have any dresses. So she went to a thrift store and bought a dress that she liked for about €4.</li><li>It was cold and wet in Austria, and Kristi did not have an umbrella or waterproof later. So she bought a water-resistant layer at a department store for €15. She could have packed more clothing at the beginning of the trip , but packed light, and acquired what she needed as she went. It was only after eight weeks on the road that this particular layer became critical.</li></ol><p>Now, it may seem obvious that if you need something, and you're in a city, you can probably buy it. But by PLANNING for this, you can adjust your trip packing ahead of time.</p><p>For example, in a trip, it's possible that you'll need to be able to swim, go to a formal event, exercise/work out, endure rain/snow, spill something on yourself, be comfortable in hot weather, and much more.</p><p>Right now, the minimum list of items to pack to cover those contingencies would be:</p><ul><li>Swimsuit</li><li>Formal clothing</li><li>shorts/socks/shoes/shirt appropriate for exercise</li><li>rain clothing/insulated layers</li><li>replacement clothing for whatever you could spill a drink/food on</li><li>shorts/t-shirt</li></ul><p>You would have to pack all of this clothing in addition to whatever you planned to pack and wear normally.</p><p>So, say to yourself "I'll pack for none of these activities, but will give myself permission to spend $20 to equip myself for any of these situations."</p><p>Now you've saved yourself TONS of space in your bag (maybe you won't even need to check a bag on your trip. This saves you more time and money, and you're more mobile just walking around.)</p><p> </p><p>Now, remember that "final, unexpected benefit" I mentioned earlier?</p><p>The benefit of this kind of thinking is it forces you to rely a bit more on yourself, and a bit less on stuff. You have to be prepared to think a bit outside the box, and think dispassionately about your things. You'll start thinking not just "I own these things" but also "Am I content being owned by these things?"</p><p>I was listening to a podcast by <a target="_blank" href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2016/01/22/the-tao-of-seneca/">Tim Ferriss</a>, who quoted <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger">Seneca</a>&nbsp;to this effect:</p><blockquote>A person's degree of self-ownership is inversely related to their dependence on things around them for security and provision.</blockquote><p>I'll close with a little... aspirational dreaming? food for thought?</p><p>Much of the decisions we're encouraged to make by the world around us is rooted in fear. Fear of loss, fear of impoverishment, fear of other people, fear of financial ruin, fear of someone not liking us, fear of the wrong person having power, fear of doing something and it not working out perfectly, fear of embarrassment, fear of criticism, fear of missing out, fear of being unlikable, fear of being uncool, etc.</p><p>Obviously, we don't want to be fearful. It's stressful, expensive, and greatly reduces your quality of life. So, treat your relationship with your stuff as a means of facing fear, and stepping a little beyond your comfort zone.</p><h3>Additional Reading:</h3><ul dir="ltr"><li><a target="_blank" href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2016/01/22/the-tao-of-seneca/">Seneca Audio Book from Tim Ferriss</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.theminimalists.com/jic/">The Minimalists on getting rid of "Just In Case" items</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Twenties vs. Thirties (from a feeling-behind-the-curve 27 year old.)</title>
      <link>/blog/twenties-vs-thirties-from-a-feeling-behind-the-curve-27-year-old</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've been wrestling with something in my head for a while. Some months ago I found a very encouraging article, comparing one's twenties to one's thirties. I've scoured everywhere that I stick notes and interesting reads, and cannot, for the life of me, find the article.</p><p>The internet is littered with <a href="https://thebolditalic.com/turning-30-described-in-charts-and-graphs-the-bold-italic-san-francisco-4aa5104b9ab0#.ppn5zux9p">tons</a> of <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacqui-zadik/10-differences-between-our-20s-vs-our-30s_b_6276860.html">fluff pieces</a> talking about sex and drinking, and comparing those in your twenties to those in your thirties, but I couldn't find much of substance.</p><p>The one piece I found <a href="http://thecooperreview.com/money-20s-vs-30s/">on money</a> was dismal.</p><p>Now, to be fair, what I'm finding is what's foisted upon me by HuffPo's SEO, and these fluff pieces get lots of links and shares, so they ride to the top of Google's rankings.</p><p>I still can't stand it. Not because it's wrong, but because there is this pervasive notion that the twenties are supposed to be the highlight of our lives, and after that, it's just work and misery, and trying to coast through life while still scraping together some fun weekends drunk.</p><p>But Josh, we <em>all</em> know that's not true. I'm in my twenties, and I know this isn't the peak of my existence.</p><p>Yes. I know this too. But I find myself slipping into this sense of "time is running out" to accomplish all that I've ever wanted to accomplish... by the time I'm 30. (I'm 27, by the way.)</p><p><a href="http://elitedaily.com/life/savings-20s-something-wrong/1214445/">This article on "If you're saving in your 20's, you're doing it wrong"</a> made the rounds a few months ago. The author argues:</p><blockquote>Your 20s are not the time to save; they’re the time to gamble. $200 a month isn't going to make the dent that a $60,000 pay raise will after spending all those nights out networking.</blockquote><p>and</p><blockquote>When you have something to bank on, you have nothing to reach for. When you have nothing to lose, you have everything to gain.</blockquote><p>She's right that $200/month won't <em>immediately</em> make you rich, and that a $60k pay raise might. But the two are connected. Mr. Money Mustache wrote a delightful response, <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2015/09/29/if-youre-not-getting-rich-in-your-20s-youre-doing-it-wrong/"><em>If You’re Not Getting Rich in your 20s, You’re Doing it Wrong</em></a>.</p><blockquote>Here’s the thing about your 20s. They are the time to work.&nbsp;The very, very best time in your life to work your ass off and create an exponential snowball of money, skills, and friendships.</blockquote><p>So, we're moving somewhere. We can discard the crap BuzzFeed pieces about alcohol tolerance in your thirties, and we know that we <em>should</em> be doing something in our twenties (besides spending all the money we make), and we've got people like Mr. Money Mustache and The Financial Diet (rebuttal title: <a href="http://thefinancialdiet.com/if-you-dont-have-savings-in-your-20s-youre-a-fucking-idiot/"><em>If You Don’t Have Savings In Your 20s, You’re A Fucking Idiot</em></a>)</p><p>The idea of "investment" threads through all these pieces. The "don't save anything" piece thinks that by saving, you're unable to invest in things that will provide a greater return down the road. The authors of the rebuttals argue that you can <em>simultaneously</em> save and invest, and that maybe even by saving more, you're better equipped to invest more.</p><p>I'm "sold" on the idea on investing right now. I will gladly invest my time, money, and effort into things that will build capacity down the road. Heck, the words you're reading right now count as an investment - I want to be a better communicator, so here I am communicating. The first piece won't be good, but maybe once I've written a thousand things I'll be bit better.</p><p>But this is a time of <em>investment</em>. I keep finding myself concerned that because I've done done one thing or another, I'll probably never do it. I've got plenty of goals, and if I accomplished them all by the time I was 30, who knows what else I'd work on. So, my recommendation to myself (and to you, if we're in the same boat):</p><blockquote>Be consistent in making small, regular investments across many domains today. Don't worry about what will come of it just yet. You've got time to let things grow.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>What I've learned from cooking in 36 kitchens in the last year</title>
      <link>/blog/what-ive-learned-from-cooking-in-36-kitchens-in-the-last-year</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kristi and I have prepared meals for (usually) ourselves and (sometimes) others in 36 (!!!) kitchens in the last year. Sometimes it's been just one night, sometimes it's every night for two months.</p><p>Needless to say, we've seen many things we like, and many things we don't like, about kitchens.</p><p>Part of me says "Josh, this is the dumbest thing ever to write about. Kitchens don't matter"</p><p>Then I think "well, we all spend a lot of time in a kitchen, and depending on how you interact with one, a kitchen can make you both healthy and rich."</p><p>(Eating at home is cheap and healthy, which is generally better than the expensive and unhealthy alternative.)</p><p>So, a kitchen is where you apply your <em>skills</em> to your <em>ingredients</em> to fuel your body, and hopefully do all of this in a frustration-free way.</p><p><strong>First, skills</strong>. Go read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Chef-Cooking-Learning-Anything/dp/0547884591"><em>The Four Hour Chef</em></a>.</p><p>Great! Now you've got skills, and if you followed along with his recommendations, you've also got a functional kitchen.</p><p><strong>Next, ingredients.</strong>&nbsp;I can't help you with. I still find grocery shopping for <em>new</em> meals to be quite challenging. So, I generally cook the same few things over and over. Breakfast and lunch is always the exact same, every day. Omelet with a meat and veggies. Dinner varies through four meals or so.</p><p><strong>The Kitchen. </strong>This<strong>&nbsp;</strong>I can talk about!</p><p>Kristi and I have a running list of things we do and don't like in kitchens, so when we get to put our own kitchen together again, we can have something that we really like.</p><p>Most of the items on our list (and there are many items on that list) fall under just a few general themes:</p><h2>Hang as much from walls as possible.</h2><ol><li>Pots and pans take up space in cabinets, and you are always nesting the one you use most often under the other two you don't use as much, so you move the same items 2x/day for no good reason. So, hang them from a wall, like with one of <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/30202092/">these</a> or ideas from <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/hang-pots-on-the-wall-week-2-choosing-the-best-hanging-system-spring-projects-from-the-kitchn-202229">here</a>.</li><li>A magnetic knife rack saves your knives from banging against each other in a drawer, and from bacteria in a knife block. Plus they look cool. Here's <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/10-places-to-hang-your-magnetic-knife-rack-200833">The Kitchn</a> on knife racks.</li><li>Mount a paper towel dispenser on the wall, or under a counter, but <em>mount it securely</em> or you'll rip it out of the wall/counter some day. I used <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Simplehuman-Mount-Paper-Holder-Stainless/dp/B002YI653C">this one</a> for ages, and loved it.</li></ol><p>If these three things are mounted on a wall (and extra rack space given to spatulas, spoons, etc) you've made HUGE progress in creating more space in your cabinets, <em>and</em> you can easily get to the pots and pans you use the most without struggling to free them from under other pans.</p><blockquote>Josh, this is all well and good, but I'm in an apartment, I can't be putting big holes in walls.</blockquote><ol><li>They don't need to be big. Everything that was really heavy I mounted with either <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/E-Z-Ancor-Stud-Solver-7-x-1-1-4-in-Alloy-Flat-Head-Self-Drilling-Drywall-Anchors-with-Screws-4-Pack-29503/100234590">this</a> or <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/p/Crown-Bolt-1-8-in-x-2-in-Zinc-Plated-Mushroom-Head-Toggle-Bolt-Anchor-10242/100349321">some of these</a>. You can repair the holes yourself, if you want, after you move out. <a href="http://www.naturalhandyman.com/iip/inffastener/infanchor/infanchor.html">Here's a good guide to hanging stuff</a>.</li><li>Worse case, the company/landlord withholds some (or all of) your security deposit. One apartment I left a bunch of holes in the wall, I think I lost $100 of my security deposit. That averaged out to $4/month for the privilege of my kitchen being a pleasant space to work. What's life without breaking some rules now and again? I guarantee you're a better tenant that most landlords are used to, so they won't be too upset.</li></ol><h2>Have as little on your countertops as possible</h2><p>When you're cooking, you need cutting boards, or space for jars, or bags of various things. You can <em>always</em> use more space. So, don't cause yourself frustration by leaving non-essential items on your countertops. Common offenders are:</p><ul><li>Knife blocks</li><li>Jars full of infrequently used ingredients, like flour, salt, and sugar, rice, pasta, assorted teas</li><li>Infrequently used appliances</li><li>Spice rack</li><li>paper towel holder</li><li>Soap dispensers (i'll address this in a moment)</li><li>Drying rack</li><li>Potted plants</li><li>More appliances</li><li>boom boxes/radios (not kidding at all here)</li><li>cup racks</li><li>misc. junk spillover that should be elsewhere. (Mail, pill containers, etc)</li></ul><p>All this stuff complicates your kitchen for several reasons:</p><ol><li>You can't use your space as well as you want, when it's most important. (while cooking!)</li><li>It's much harder to clean after cooking, because you have to move a dozen things or so to wipe down a countertop.</li></ol><p>This creates friction between you and cooking, which is bad, because cooking makes you health and rich, remember?</p><h2>Make cleanup as easy as possible</h2><p>Cooking is not easy, but doing a huge pile of dishes in a space that is not conducive to cleaning dishes makes it 10x worse.</p><p>The first offender here is a split sink. I don't know why split sinks are so common. It seems to be that people like using the 2nd side as a drying rack, but I think that's sacrificing a huge amount of valuable space for something that can be had on the counter next to the sink. If you're remodeling a kitchen, just buy a $20 drying mat (I used <a href="http://www.amazon.com/OXO-Grips-Silicone-Drying-Square/dp/B002UTG7WY">this one</a> for years, loved it) and get an extra large, extra deep sink.</p><p>It doesn't matter. No one is going to change their sink because they read an article, so lets just do the best with whatever kind of sink you've got. There's plenty of room to optimize.</p><ol><li><strong>Have a good sponge. </strong>They cost almost nothing, but are the thing that does all the work of cleaning. Buy in bulk, and liberally throw them out as they get old and smelly. Get something that has an abrasive pad on one side. They're yellow and green, and cheap.</li><li><strong>Don't scorn rubber gloves.</strong> When I can, I use dishwashing gloves. The ones I own are usually yellow or pink. Some people laugh, and then I explain: I like hot water, and all the soap and water and grease is rough on my hands. I rock climb, a lot, so unhealthy skin is <em>deeply</em> frustrating. Once I started doing dishes with rubber gloves, I never wanted to go back. They cost a dollar or three, last ages.</li><li><strong>Have one-handed soap dispensers.</strong> Imagine you've got one hand on a dish, and the other hand is holding a sponge. You need more soap on the sponge. What do you do?</li></ol><p><strong>Option 1</strong>: Put dish down, use still-dirty/wet/soapy hand to grab soap container, invert said container over sponge, squeeze out some soap, replace container on counter, pick up dish again, and resume cleaning</p><p><strong>Option 2</strong>: With one hand, press down on a soap dispenser into your sponge, and resume cleaning.</p><p><a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Umbra-Joey-Ceramic-Soap-Pump-Dispenser-Scrubby-Kitchen-Holder-Bathroom-Liquid-/221806220590">Something like this</a> will help doing dishes be less unfun.</p><ol><li><strong>Have a good place to dry dishes.</strong> I've mentioned <a href="http://www.amazon.com/OXO-Grips-Silicone-Drying-Square/dp/B002UTG7WY">this drying mat</a> before, I'll mention it again. I've found drying rack preferences to be deeply personal and contentious, so... you do you.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Wipe down your counters <em>with one hand</em>.</strong> Cleanup is way more than just dishes, you need to clean work surfaces. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Windex-Antibacterial-Cleaner-Kitchen-Glistening/dp/B00AJLYILM/ref=pd_bxgy_121_img_2?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=0AARTN3B53KCFHCECE1S">This soap dispenser</a> allows you to press a folded paper towel into the top of it, and it dispenses lysol. This was one of two things we kept on our counters full-time, and it made wiping down the counters SO EASY.</li><li><strong>Put your trashcan close to your sink.</strong> Generally, any time you move stuff from your sink to your trash, it's gross. It's food stuck in a strainer, or something covered in raw meat juice, or something else. The last thing you want to do is cross your kitchen dripping gross liquid across your floor. So, if you have a "mobile" trash can, make it easy to put next to the sink, and make sure it's something you can operate with one foot.</li></ol><p>(Side bar - most pedal-operated trashcans don't work.

      <title>The Slight Edge, and why you should read it</title>
      <link>/blog/the-slight-edge-and-why-you-should-read-it</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Slight-Edge-Turning-Disciplines-Massive/dp/193594486X">The Slight Edge</a> a few months ago.</p><p>Since then, it's been the book I recommend most often to most people. (I don't make book recommendations willy-nilly, but if something seems relevant to what the person I'm speaking to is experiencing/thinking about, I make a recommendation.)</p><p>I joyfully recommend other books about career advice, money management, exercise, and I love fiction, so I've always got a bunch of those ready to recommend too, but usually <em>The Slight Edge</em>&nbsp;is the most appropriate recommendation.</p><p>I wish I could recommend the Kindle version of the book, but... I can't. :(</p><p>Jeff Olson wrote the first version maybe ten years ago. It was a massive success. So, recently, he wrote an "updated" version, that basically spends half the book explaining how good the ideas in the first version are, and all the spin-off books, conferences, etc that have come from it.</p><p>The content of the most recent version is still <em>good</em>, it's just filled with tons of fluff that doesn't need to be there.</p><p>Go compare the Amazon reviews of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Slight-Edge-Turning-Disciplines-Massive/dp/193594486X">first version</a> to those of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Slight-Edge-Turning-Disciplines-Happiness-ebook/dp/B00GDKN3T6?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=the%20slight%20edge&amp;qid=1462964407&amp;ref_=sr_1_1_ha&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sr=1-1">second version</a></p><p>Even the 2nd version has an 88% rate of five stars, out of about 1000 reviews, so not too shabby, but feel free, if you read it, to skip the bits that you don't want to read.</p><p>Here's the premise of the book:</p><blockquote>Small actions, taken every day, compound. They compound in a way that hurts you, or in a way that helps you. Progress may seem nonexistent, but take joy in the small beneficial "slight edge" actions you can take, and over time, you'll have something great. Conversely, if you take the slightly easier option of many small harmful (or neutral) decisions every day, over time these compound against you and your health, relationships, finances, etc.</blockquote><p>Go read the book. The original edition costs $7 + shipping <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Slight-Edge-Turning-Disciplines-Massive/dp/193594486X">via Amazon</a> (I don't do affiliate links, by the way.) and you can read it over the next month. That's about 10 minutes of reading a day.</p><p>I referenced this book when I wrote that "<a href="http://josh.works/blog/everything-i-do-and-think-ive-read-in-a-book-or-exploring-the-relationship-between-books-and-money">Everything I do and think I've read in a book</a>", and how the mentality outlined in this book trickle down through every part of your life, <em>whether you are aware of it or not</em>.</p><p>Read it.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Slight-Edge-Turning-Disciplines-Massive/dp/193594486X">Here's the link again</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How to never accidentally click Twitter's "Moments" again (and to block anything else on the internet you don't want to deal with)</title>
      <link>/blog/how-to-never-accidentally-click-twitters-moments-again-and-to-block-anything-else-on-the-internet-you-dont-want-to-deal-with</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you use Twitter's "Moments" tool, or do you just find it really annoying?</p><p>Most people find it annoying. Here's how to get rid of Twitter's "Moments"&nbsp;forever:</p><p><strong>0. Be won over to using an ad blocker on the internet. </strong><br />They don't block just ads, but malicious scripts and bandwidth-hogging junk. I'm a huge fan, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5649025/why-you-should-use-adblock-plus-even-if-you-dont-block-ads">so is Lifehacker</a>. <a href="http://thisinterestsme.com/adblock-bad-thing-people-use-selfish/">Others are not</a>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. Install uBlock Origin. </strong><br />Here's links for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm/reviews?hl=en">Chrome</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">Firefox</a>, and...&nbsp;the jury is still out for a good ad blocker for Safari.<br /><br />Already using AdBlock Plus? "uBlock is lighter/quicker than ABP" -&nbsp;<a href="http://lifehacker.com/ublock-is-a-fast-and-lightweight-alternative-to-adblock-1625246461">Lifehacker</a><br /><br />(There's a big kerfuffle about uBlock vs. uBlock Origin. I just <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ublock/comments/32mos6/ublock_vs_ublock_origin/">trust the internet</a> and went with uBlock Origin.)<br /><br /><strong>2.&nbsp;Click the uBlock icon, and click the eye dropper tool. </strong><br />The tool label is "Enter Element picker mode"</p><p><strong>3. </strong><strong>Move the element picker to the <em>entire</em> "Moments" section. </strong><br />(Not just the text or the icon)</p><p><strong>4. Click it (or any section of the page you want to hide)</strong><br />You know you want to. You won't break anything. Once you click it - the thing you clicked? It's GONE!</p><p><strong>5. On the tooltip that pops up in the bottom right of your screen, mouse over it, and click "create"</strong></p><p>Here's a gif of using uBlock:</p>

<p>If you make a mistake, no sweat. Right click on the uBlock icon&gt;options&gt;my filters&gt;delete the rule you don't want&gt;apply changes</p>

<p> </p><p>Done! Never get frustrated clicking into "Moments" again!</p><p>You can use it elsewhere, too.</p><p>For example, email "subscribe now" popups can get annoying.</p><p>I've subscribed to a newsletter (<a target="_blank" href="http://kopywritingkourse.com/blog/">Kopywriting Kourse</a>, if you must know), and when I click a link in the emails I receive, I get more popups asking me to join the newsletter! So, I use uBlock to permanently hide the popup:</p>

<p> </p><p>That's all. Hopefully this is useful!</p><p>PS: The controversy about ad blockers makes me think about advertising as a huge mis-allocation of resources for modern man. I'll expand on this some day.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>My all-time favorite question to ask people (and why you should ask it too)</title>
      <link>/blog/my-favorite-question</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I met two people yesterday from Colorado, while in Spain. We climbed together yesterday and today, and Kristi and I had dinner with them.</p><p>Half way through the meal, I asked my all-time favorite question:</p><blockquote>If you could go back to twenty five year old you, and tell yourself anything, knowing it was coming from future you, what would you say? (And where were you living/what were you doing as a twenty five year old.)</blockquote><p>I've asked this of probably a hundred people, and <em>always</em> get an interesting answer.</p><p>Want to know why I'm asking?</p><p>I'm 27. Having 100 people reflect on what they'd tell a younger version of themselves is a pretty good way to learn things.</p><p>Now, I don't recall many specific answers. Usually it segways into a larger conversation. Few people have concise, ready answers.</p><p>But if I did have a ready-made list of answers that were really insightful and a little irrelevant, I think it would look a lot like this list: <a href="https://medium.com/life-learning/40-things-about-life-i-wish-i-could-travel-back-in-time-and-tell-myself-e52f2effa3ab#.vm6s6w33h"><em>40 things about life I wish I could travel back in time and tell myself</em></a></p><p>How about you?</p><p>If you could tell your twenty five year old self anything, what would it be? (If you're younger than twenty eight, the question changes to "if you could tell your twenty <em>one</em> year old self anything...")</p><h2>You should ask this question of those around you</h2><p dir="ltr">This is a weighty question. Usually, when I ask someone, they say "hm. That's a good question..." and then they're quiet for a moment. They think, a lot. And their answer paves the way to great conversation, in addition to being useful in its own right.</p><p dir="ltr">Sometimes they thank me for the question. It's a good way to show someone that you're listening to them, and interested in them. These are good things.</p><h2>Related</h2><ul dir="ltr"><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Never-Eat-Alone-Expanded-Updated-ebook/dp/B00H6JBFOS?ie=UTF8&amp;btkr=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=dp-kindle-redirect">Never Eat Alone</a> by Keith Ferrazzi. People are good, you should learn from them and enjoy yourself around them. This book will teach you how. It taught me how.</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Cheap fix to night-time teeth grinding</title>
      <link>/blog/fix-night-time-teeth-grinding</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few years ago, I found out I grind me teeth at night.</p><p>Kristi says it sounds like I'm chewing marbles.</p><p>Others who grind their teeth give themselves headaches, or wake themselves up at night.</p><p>You can't really stop yourself from grinding your teeth, since you're asleep.</p><p>You <em>can</em> stop chewing gum, and try to be less stressed, but the go-too solution for teeth-grinders is a mouth guard.</p><p>Custom mouth guards are expensive and uncomfortable.</p><p>Over the counter mouth guards fall into two categories:</p><ol><li>Bulky mouth guards that you soak in boiling water and then fit to your teeth. I tried two of these, and found them to not be that comfortable, AND I bit through BOTH of them after a week or two. Whoa.</li><li>Low profile mouth guards that are basically like magic. I use the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Plackers-Mouth-Guard-Grind-Night/dp/B004TD23W2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8">Plackers Mouth Guard Grind No More</a>* exclusively now. Supposedly they are disposable, but I use them for a few months at a time. They have very little texture, so they're easy to clean/don't get smelly, and they're small and flexible, so they take up very little space in a toiletry kit.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>And, as a bonus, they are comfortable, and don't impede my talking.</p><p>They're cheap as dirt (you can buy them one-at-a-time in a pharmacy, for $1.20 or so), and if you try them and <em>don't</em> like them, you've lost nothing.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Plackers-Mouth-Guard-Grind-Night/dp/B004TD23W2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8">Give 'em a shot</a></p><p>*I don't do affiliate links.

      <title>Give it 30 days</title>
      <link>/blog/give-it-30-days</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you have any big audacious goal you want to accomplish?</p><p>If you think back to Jan 1, 2016, what were your goals?</p><ul><li>Lose weight/get in shape</li><li>Make more money/start budgeting</li><li>Learn a language</li><li>Learn a skill</li><li>Read more</li><li>Stop doing something (smoking, drinking)</li></ul><p>Statistically, all of these efforts failed within the first few weeks of 2016.</p><p>I believe that May 16th, 2016, is a far better day for a SHORT exploratory period of a goal.</p><h2>You won't complete bad goals</h2><p>None of the items in the above list meet the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria">criteria of a good goal</a>. A good goal needs to be:</p><ul><li>Specific</li><li>Measurable</li><li>Assignable</li><li>Realistic</li><li>Time-related</li></ul><p>(See the acronym those words make? SMART. heh)</p><p>A nice time-period for me is a month.</p><p>I can do something regularly for a month, and I am <em>way</em> more motivated to give it a good go than think to myself "well, today's the first day of a new thing that I want to do, and I'm going to do it <em>every day for the rest of my life.</em></p><p>(Easy example is right now I'm publishing something every day. For a month. I'm about half way through. No way I would be motivated to stick with this for a year, or the rest of my life)</p><h2>Failure to keep a goal provides valuable insight</h2><p>If most Americans have a New Years resolution, you can be sure that most of <em>those</em> Americans then guilt themselves some time later about not actually completing the resolutions.</p><p>They shouldn't. We have a powerful sense of inertia in our life, and this keeps us powering through the day-to-day without any major problems. It's a <em>good thing</em> that we can't rewrite our habits quickly or easily. It's just also a frustrating thing.</p><p>Don't be frustrated that your habit didn't stick. Press into that frustration and dig into "why did the habit not stick?". <a href="http://josh.works/blog/2013/05/03/intentional-habit-building">I'm of the opinion that habits only work if you make it <em>really really easy</em> to keep the habit</a>, but this front-loads the effort of making a new habit, which is hard.</p><p>Plan on failing. Since failure provides information, don't beat yourself up over it, just regroup, re-evaluate, and give it another go.</p><h2><em>Time-boxing lets you (makes you?) decide where you want to be in a month</em></h2><p>I've been trying to learn French recently, and trying to improve my Spanish. It's not plausible to do these simultaneously, and "improve my {language}" is a <em>terrible</em> goal.</p><p>So, today, I told my French-speaking language buddy I needed to postpone our next session by a month, so I could spend time on Spanish. Then, in a month, I'll take a few days of a "break", and move back into French mode.</p><p>This makes me feel <em>very</em> motivated to make progress in Spanish, because I'm "time boxed", and once this month is through, it'll be at least another six weeks before I practice my Spanish again.</p><p>So, I'm going to work on Spanish for 30 days. Coming soon is "How I find native Spanish speakers to practice with." (It has nothing to do with being in a Spanish speaking country)</p><h3>Related</h3><ul><li><a href="http://josh.works/blog/2013/05/03/intentional-habit-building">Intentional Habit Building</a> (By me)</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Input metrics vs. Output metrics</title>
      <link>/blog/input-metrics-vs-output-metrics</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's tempting to track results, when trying to accomplish something.</p>

<p>If you're working on any project of sufficient size, the results will come
slowly, fitfully, and sometimes not at all.</p>

<p>So, don't track results, track your efforts. (Yes, how very American of me.
I don't believe in participation awards, or helicopter parenting, etc. Bear
with me.)</p>

<p>Time box your efforts (one month is a nice period of time) and then do your
"input" for one month. At the end of the month, step back and look for the
results.</p>

<p>But don't do the thing a few times, and expect results quickly. That's an
easy way to get frustrated.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Millionaire Next Door</title>
      <link>/blog/the-millionaire-next-door</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm struggling to know what to write about <em>The Millionaire Next Door.</em></p><p>It's got many wonderful traits, and I strongly recommend that you read it (I wouldn't mention it otherwise) but it's got some flaws. I'm afraid if I focus on the flaws, I'll turn people off from it that might otherwise read it, but if I don't, I'll do readers a disservice.</p><p>So, here we go:</p><h3>Read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Next-Door-Surprising-Americas/dp/1589795474/ref=sr_1_1"><em>The Millionaire Next Door</em></a> because:</h3><ul><li>Most of us have an incorrect perception of what it looks like to be a millionaire, and that colors our thinking about wealth. (Hint: the "average" millionaire looks pretty unremarkable.)</li><li>The book will hopefully inspire some self-evaluation in new ways. (It did for me)</li><li>You might finish the book with a new appreciation for financial independence, rather than making a certain amount of money. (Hint: financial independence requires a lot of money, but not nearly as much as most people might think.)</li><li>It's an engaging read</li></ul><h3>If you read it, be careful because:</h3><ul><li>Survivorship bias is all over this book. They interview millionaires, and then look for common threads. There may be a large group of people out there who did most of the same things and are not millionaires. This group will never be counted.</li><li>The book seems a bit too trusting in some ways. Easy example is it's way easier to be a millionaire today than it was in 2000, because the value of the dollar has sunk considerably. So the bar is getting lower and lower, and understates the significance of the achievements of a self-made millionaire in the 1980s.</li></ul><p>Here's the link again: <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Next-Door-Surprising-Americas/dp/1589795474/ref=sr_1_1">The Millionaire Next Door: The Surprising Secrets of America's Wealthy</a></em></p>]]></content:encoded>
      <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px">I'm struggling to know what to write about <em>The Millionaire Next Door.</em></p><p>It's got many wonderful traits, and I strongly recommend that you read it (I wouldn't mention it otherwise) but it's got some flaws. I'm afraid if I focus on the flaws, I'll turn people off from it that might otherwise read it, but if I don't, I'll do readers a disservice.</p><p>So, here we go:</p><h3>Read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Next-Door-Surprising-Americas/dp/1589795474/ref=sr_1_1"><em>The Millionaire Next Door</em></a>&nbsp;because:</h3><ul><li>Most of us have an incorrect perception of what it looks like to be a millionaire, and that colors our thinking about wealth.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I mentioned that <a href="http://josh.works/blog/advantage-of-low-friction-goals">low friction goals are an advantage</a> over "high friction" goals.</p><p>This is just another way of saying "easy things are easier to do than harder things". Revelatory, I know.</p><p>Similarly, <a href="http://josh.works/blog/2013/05/03/intentional-habit-building">I wrote a long time ago that</a>:</p><blockquote>We tell ourselves we can't accomplish goals because we don't have enough motivation, but this is far too simple of an explanation... it must be useful to fail during your attempt, and you must not try very hard.</blockquote><p>In other words, big grand goals are great, but expect that you will not successfully execute on them all. Plan to fail the primary task, and in doing so, you'll gain information that will make your second attempt that much better.</p><p>I don't know that I've learned a lot from the things I've failed to execute on. I certainly have not reduced the size and scope of my projects, but I'm getting a bit more thoughtful about them. For example, I'm working now in 30 day chunks. A project (like budgeting) is much more approachable when you're doing it for just 29 or 30 days.</p><p>Anyway, that's part of what this writing has been about. I had a lot in my head I wanted to get out, so I said "I'll publish something every day, and I won't queue anything in advance."</p><p>I'm writing, my idea-muscles are getting some exercise, and I'm laying a foundation for my next projects. Hopefully, throughout it all, I'll be able to share useful things.</p><p>All in all, a good use of a few minutes every day.</p><p><strong>Further Reading:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/09/talkers-block.html">Seth Godin on writing every day</a></li><li><a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2014/05/the-ultimate-guide-for-becoming-an-idea-machine/">James Altucher, How to become an idea machine</a> (Very long post)</li><li><a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2012/05/10-rules-about-blogging/">James Altucher, 10 rules</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Constraints</title>
      <link>/blog/constraints</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Constraints are USUALLY seen in a negative light.</p><p>Google defines it as:</p><blockquote>a limitation or restriction</blockquote><p>Here's some example constraints that we find in the world around us, which we often view as an annoyance or frustration:</p><ul><li>I have to be to work by 9a</li><li>I have to get up at 7a</li><li>I have $50 to spend on entertainment this month</li><li>This paper must be at least 8 pages long</li><li>I have only 30 minutes of time to myself every day between work and family and sleep</li><li>And many, many more. Some trivial, some not.</li></ul><p>Obviously, no one pops out of bed in the morning thrilled that they have a limited amount of money to spend on something.</p><p>Constraints relate to prioritization, which means you don't actually <em>have</em> to follow them, you just have to care if the item producing the constraint matters to you.</p><p>Easy example: I don't follow many rules of writing, or anything really, when writing on my own website, because... I can do whatever I want. I have goals and ideals with my writing, but they're more like aspirations than constraints.</p><p>I can stick in unrelated images and comics wherever I want, if I so choose.</p>

<h2>Embrace as many constraints as you can</h2><p>So what about embracing constraints?</p><p>I decided to pick the first two words that popped out of a random word generator, and see if I could make something useful from it.</p><p>I think I'm off to a strong start:</p>

      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/574022b6e321400346093758/1463820985781/Random_Word_Generator_-_Creative_online_tool_to_generating_randomized_words_for_brainstorming_.png" alt=""/>


<p>On to Wikipedia, to find something useful.&nbsp;</p><p>Searching "rodent actor" didn't turn up anything good.</p><p>The "Rodent" wikipedia page came up blank when I ctrl+F'd for "movie".</p><p>So, I turned back to Google, and found this gem: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/list/ls000471351/">Top 10 films featuring rats</a></p><p>Interestingly, the #2 listing is Ratatouille, which I both watched and ate in the last few weeks. It's delicious, and an enjoyable movie. Turns out <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0652663/?ref_=tt_cl_t1">Patton Oswalt</a> is the voice behind Remy, the movie's protagonist rat.</p>

      <a href="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/pixar/images/a/a9/Ratatouille-remy3.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/235?cb=20150214191242" ><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/574022f6d51cd44d18680e91/1463821048085/Ratatouille-remy3.jpg" alt=""/></a>


<p><a href="http://pixar.wikia.com/wiki/File:Ratatouille-remy3.jpg"><em>Pixar.wikia.com</em></a></p><p>He was also in <em>Blade:Trinity</em> and <em>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</em>.</p><p>And boom. There's something to write about off of two random words.</p><p>PS Why is embracing constraints on my mind? I'm trying to get better at doing just a few things, not all the things.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Career advice for Millenials. (ugh. I hate this title)</title>
      <link>/blog/career-advice-for-millenials-ugh-i-hate-this-title</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hah! You thought <em>I</em> had career advice?</p><p>Not quite.</p><p>Christian Bonilla writes one of the best blogs I've ever read at <a href="http://www.smartlikehow.com/">Smart Like How</a>. Please click over there, and read a few of his posts.</p><p>He talks about being <a href="http://www.smartlikehow.com/blog-native/2015/12/1/not-a-data-scientist-no-problem-you-can-still-be-data-savvy-than-most">data savy</a> even if you're not a data scientist. He covers <a href="http://www.smartlikehow.com/blog-native/2015/9/14/want-to-succeed-in-your-new-job-build-a-strong-mental-model">how to suceed in a new job</a>, and many other things.</p><p>I finished his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Smart-Like-How-Hidden-Success-ebook/dp/B0181C4N56?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=smart%20like%20how&amp;qid=1464215741&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;sr=8-1">Smart Like How: The Hidden Side of Career Success</a> today, and highlighted many portions of it, because they contained <em>specific and actionable suggestions</em>.</p><p>I'll expand on these in a later post.</p><p>In some ways, I'm not at the very beginning of my career. I'm 27, and there are plenty of people way farther along than I. But I didn't get into my current line of work until two years ago, and have only recently been feeling like I've got my head wrapped around the work that I do.</p><p>No matter what kind of job you have, his book is desperately useful. If you don't like your job, you should read it. If you're ambivilant about your job, you should read it. If you love your job, you should read it.</p><p>And as much as we all will agree that work isn't everything, it sure is significant enough to devote a bit of time to reading it.</p><p>Yesterday, I mentioned Patrick McKenzie's "<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11743920">Daenerys Targaryen test</a>":</p><blockquote>I propose the Daenerys Targaryen test.</blockquote><blockquote>If you know who Daenerys Targaryen is, you do not have "no time." You have priorities which included "I wish to know who Daenerys Targaryen is." No judgement! I do, too! But if you know who Daenerys Targaryen is and you're dissatisfied with your career growth, you should attempt to consciously be aware of the fact that you can choose different things in the future.</blockquote><p>So, if you watch GoT, or any other show, with any regularity, you have enough time and money to pick up <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Smart-Like-How-Hidden-Success-ebook/dp/B0181C4N56?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=smart%20like%20how&amp;qid=1464215741&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;sr=8-1">this book</a></p><p>Go forth and prosper.</p><p>PS Do you know someone who might benefit from that book, or the Smart Like How blog? I bet you do. Why don't you send them a link to his articles, or to this post, so they'll be inspired to soak up his wisdom.&nbsp;</p><p>Sharing useful things with people is one of the best ways to add value to the world. Do it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Social skills are like any other skills</title>
      <link>/blog/social-skills-are-like-any-other-skills</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Learning social <em>skills</em> are no different from learning cooking <em>skills</em>, or handstand <em>skills</em>. It helps to have exposure at a young age, but with time and effort, you can learn, and even master, cooking, handstands, and social skills.</p><h2>Why do social skills matter?</h2><p>Most people get along fine with their friends, and don't particularly enjoy the "go out and meet new people and make small talk until you each promise to stay in touch and never actually talk again" game.</p><p>That game is dumb. Social skills are important.</p><p>Here's the reconciliation:</p><p>Social skills can be defined in many different ways, from pick-up artists (ugh) to boiler-room sales guys.</p><p>No one wants to be either of those two types, and no one is telling you to do that. Here's my take on social skills:</p><p>They can help you increase your impact on the world around you by meeting new people (and building stronger relationships with existing acquintances) and giving them something nice.</p><p>That's right. You can <em>serve others</em> with social skills. If you're trying to have a positive impact on the world around you, a great start is by:</p><ul><li>Putting others at ease</li><li>Finding out meaningful things about people</li><li>Being able to help them</li></ul><p>Usually, the "help" you can offer is just information. Sort of like I'm doing right now.</p><p>"Oh, you have a problem with X? I read a thing about that who had some good advice. I'll email you a link to the article."</p><p>Boom. You've helped that person. Easy as that.</p><p><strong><em>I'm shy, and don't like stupid small talk</em></strong></p><p>A harsh read of shyness is "shy people are selfish". Here's why:</p><ul><li>If talking to someone, you force the other person to carry the conversation. (This is draining and not much fun)</li><li>If not talking to someone, you'll never start, so you miss an opportunity to care for them, encourage them, or make them laugh, feel joy, etc.</li><li>If in the same area as another shy person, <em>you'll both be miserable because neither will break the ice</em>.</li></ul><p>Like I said - that's a "harsh" read of being shy.</p><p>As far as small talk - if you don't like small talk, <em>don't participate in small talk</em>. Guide the conversation elsewhere. You and whoever you are talking to will appreciate it. Once you own the relationship trajectory, you can't complain about small talk, because you're facilitating it.</p><h2>Social skills will help you grow as a person more than most other skills</h2><p>We learn from people, either by observation or interaction. You'll get more from both if you are comfortable talking with others in a range of situations and about a range of topics.</p><p>If you want to grow as a person, start with how you interact with others. It's a gift that keeps on giving.</p><h2>If you're still with me, read these:</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Never-Eat-Alone-Expanded-Updated-ebook/dp/B00H6JBFOS?ie=UTF8&amp;btkr=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=dp-kindle-redirect">Never Eat Alone</a>&nbsp;(book)</li><li><a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2008/12/22/how-to-be-more-social/">How To Be More Social</a>&nbsp;(article by Scott Young)</li><li><a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2008/06/05/social-skills-and-dancing-for-dummies/">Social Skills and Dancing for Dummies</a>&nbsp;(article by Scott Young)</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>On Boldness In Climbing</title>
      <link>/blog/on-boldness-in-climbing</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Climb boldly. I've tried to write about this many times, and have *thousands* of words scattered across my computer about this topic. I always felt like I wasn't communicating it quite right. I wasn't happy with it.</p><p>So I said "screw it, I'll explain it like I would if I were teaching it in a class."</p><p>That's the video below. Well, part of it.</p><p>If you're a rock climber, and fear is on your mind, this is for you:</p>

      <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px">I turned eight minutes of talking and thinking into fifty four seconds of useful material.</p><p>I shouldn't be surprised at this ratio of signal to noise.</p><p>Signal-to-noise ratio (abbreviated SNR or S/N) is a measure used in science and engineering that compares the level of a desired signal to the level of background noise. It is defined as the ratio of signal power to the noise power <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio">Wikipedia</a></p><p>This concept has been top-of-mind for me for a few days now, not from an engineering perspective, but from an "information density" perspective.</p><p>The video below is a good example. I spent almost eight minutes talking into the camera, trying to tease an idea out of my own head. I wasn't able to express it well via a keyboard, and was frustrated, thinking "I wrote the curriculum for this class, and taught it many times. Why can't I explain it?"</p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

      <title>62 lessons learned after one year of full-time travel</title>
      <link>/blog/62-lessons-learned-after-year-of-full-time-travel</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kristi and I <a target="_blank" href="http://teamthompsontravels.tumblr.com/post/145144220613/1-year-travelversary-exactly-one-year-ago-on-may">put together a non-comprehensive list of things we've learned while traveling full-time last year</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Samples:</p><h2><strong>Kristi</strong></h2><p><strong>1. Josh and I are such a good team, and we balance each other.</strong>&nbsp;We’ve figured out our strengths and how to contribute to our successes together. It’s very difficult to imagine doing the work and planning this lifestyle requires alone.</p><p><strong>2. Basic tasks are so hard in a new place.&nbsp;</strong>Finding a grocery store? Checking out at the grocery store? Buying a bus ticket? Filling up the gas tank? (Okay, that’s hard for this Jersey girl just about everywhere.) All such little, simple tasks at home. All can be completely overwhelming in a foreign country.</p><p><strong>3. It is important and polite to speak enough of a language to be able to ask a local if they speak English in their native language.</strong></p><p><strong>4. Traveling light makes everything so much simpler.</strong></p>

      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/574cb2731bbee0675b539653/1464644218553//img.jpg" alt=""/>


<p> </p><h2><strong>Josh</strong></h2><p><strong>41. Try to write down one nice thing per day on your travels.</strong>&nbsp;Easy to forget the minutia otherwise. For example, in Austria I didn’t write anything down for a whole month. But in Costa Rica, I wrote something down every day. I can remember so much more from Costa Rica than from Austria.</p><p><strong>42. If you want to learn a language, it’s best to get the basics down BEFORE you arrive in-country</strong></p><p><strong>43. Learn to cook a basic, simple meal with ingredients you can get anywhere.</strong>That way, you can always have something that is familiar, and you don’t have to eat out as much as you might otherwise. We make tacos, spaghetti, chili, and chicken or pork chops with rice everywhere we go.</p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

Buying a bus ticket? Filling up the gas tank? (Okay, that’s hard for this Jersey girl just about everywhere.) All such little, simple tasks at home. All can be completely overwhelming in a foreign country.</p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

      <title>An Intro to Customer Success</title>
      <link>/blog/an-intro-to-customer-success</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Customer Success - what is it?</h2><p>When I tell people I work in "Customer Success", they immediately think I do either Customer Support, or sales*. In a way, they are correct. I do both. Today, and more in the future, I'll dig deep into this particular industry*.</p><hr /><p>A traditional <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchase_funnel">marketing funnel</a>&nbsp;narrows as it draws people from the top "creating awareness" pool, down through prospects &gt; leads &gt; trials &gt; and eventually (hopefully!) customers.</p>

       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="704.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/574e14d34c2f850c8f5f4c91/1464734935461//img.jpg" alt="Notice that the funnel gets smaller with each step, and ends when the customer pays you. Source: beintheknow.co "/> Notice that the funnel gets smaller with each step, and ends when the customer pays you. Source: beintheknow.co [/caption]


<p>There's different kinds of funnels, or different labels for each stage, but the goal is to identify and speak to a target audience, convince them you can do something valuable for them, and then have them become a customer. (I.E. pay you money)</p><p>A "customer" can be a one-time purchase, recurring purchase, subscription, etc. Anything where they pay you money. Litmus is a business-to-business software-as-a-service company. All of our customers are subscribers. We don't have any one-off purchase options.</p><p>There's very few barriers to becoming a customer of Litmus. No disks to have delivered in the mail, no software to install, no hardware to buy and techs to pay to install it, no contracts, no sales team, and quite inexpensive prices. A few visits to Chipotle/month is the same cost as a basic Litmus account.</p><p>Low friction is good! This means we can have many, many customers and don't have to spend lots of time and effort getting each customer. This is good for them, too, as they can kick the tires of Litmus via a trial, and don't have to talk to a sales rep or anything else.</p><p>This ease of becoming a customer has an edge, though. It means it's just as easy to <em>stop</em> being a customer. Click a few buttons (A max of three mouse clicks from any page in your Litmus account) and your account will be closed, and you'll never be billed again.</p><p>In the marketing funnel, your goal is to increase conversions through each stage of the funnel, ultimately boosting your numbers of new customers. A Customer Success team looks at a different kind of funnel.*</p><h2>Difference between customer success and marketing</h2><p>If you invert the marketing funnel, and start with your customers (and ignore everyone who is not yet a customer) you'll have what you HOPE is a path of growth for your customers.</p><p>Here's a quick example. I've inverted a traditional marketing funnel, and now the TOP of the funnel is when someone becomes a customer. (Ideally, funnel width is proportional to growing revenue from your customers)</p>

<p>To a SaaS company, marketing is only half the battle. Once you get customers in, you need to keep them.</p><p>With low costs to start using a tool, there are low costs to leaving it. There are no multi-year contracts you need to sign, no six-figure hardware installs and ongoing maintenance agreements. You just click the "cancel" button in your account, and you're done.</p><p>So, a customer success team deals with the time in a customer's life between when they become a customer, and when they stop being a customer.*&nbsp;</p><p>From the customer's perspective, <em>this is the most important time. Indeed, this is the only time that matters. This is certainly the only time the customer is thinking about you</em>. Many companies, however, they're not quite sure how to focus on their existing customers.</p><p>If you want a hint - go talk to your customer support team. They'll have more than enough feedback to get you moving in the right direction.&nbsp;</p><p>I'll dig more into this soon.</p><p>*<em>"Customer Success" can be defined in many ways. Some companies label their outbound sales team "customer success". Sometimes a strict support team goes by that title. Rather than calling out these companies for appropriating the wrong title - I'd say it's aspirational and encouraging. If a company is reorienting itself around MY success, as a customer, I'm quite pleased.<br /><br />Furthermore, there are many different angles by which you could get at "customer success". If you're a software company, everyone who works on the core product is technically serving the customer. If you're in the X team, you're serving the customer, so aren't we all in the "customer success" business?&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Yes, but for the sake of roles, lets keep it simple and assume divisions. Phew.</em></p><p><strong>Additional Reading:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="http://sixteenventures.com/">Sixteen Ventures</a> - Lincoln Murphy is THE go-to expert on this.</li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Customer-Success-Innovative-Companies-Recurring/dp/1119167965">Customer Success: How Innovative Companies Are Reducing Churn and Growing Recurring Revenue</a> (By Lincoln and others)</li><li><p><a target="_blank" href="http://josh.works/?category=Customer%20Success">More that I've written on Customer Success</a></p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://josh.works/?category=Customer%20Success"></a></p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year, I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AKKS278/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">The Miracle Morning</a>, which promises (paraphrasing here):</p><blockquote>If you do these seven things every morning you'll be the most amazing person you've ever met.</blockquote><p>OK, it's not exactly that bold, but it's not far off. It wasn't a terrible book, it had lots of good things, but the author made sure you knew he was awesome. (The author was at one point the top Cutco salesmen in the world...)</p><p>To be honest, I reluctantly enjoyed the book. I didn't want to, and wanted to be able to mentally tune out, but it was compelling. Here's <a href="http://lifehacker.com/start-your-day-off-right-with-the-savers-morning-routin-1716241117">Lifehacker</a> on it, and <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2015/07/how-to-win-the-day/">James Altucher interviewing Hal Elrod</a>.</p><p>Read those summaries before deciding to read the book.</p><p>Anyway - the ONE practice from this book that still impacts me today almost every day is that of "daily gratitude". <em>The Miracle Morning</em> certainly wasn't the first to discuss this, but it finally made it stick.</p><p>Every day, or almost every day, for much of the last five months, I've written down three things that I'm thankful for every day.</p><p>I started keeping them on a really long text document on my phone, but the size of the list was making it buggy. (Sidebar- <a href="http://9to5google.com/2016/06/01/google-keep-web-redesign/">Google Keep</a> is a delightful app. Android, Mac, iPhone - it works everywhere.)</p><p>Every few months, I like to look back through what I've written and remember what caused me to write it. Since the only rule is "no repeating", I've had to become attentive to the things I can be thankful for every day, since I need to find something <em>new</em> every day. (Three things every day, actually.)</p><p>If someone said "Hey, sit down and write 360 things you are thankful for", it would take you a long time. You might not be able to. But write down three things a day for four months... there's your list of 360 things.</p><p>Oh, I stopped using Google Keep, as I mentioned. Now I'm using <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.journey.app&amp;hl=en">Journey</a> on Android and Chrome. So far so good.

      <title>Success is not support</title>
      <link>/blog/success-is-not-support</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://josh.works/blog/an-intro-to-customer-success">We did a high-level "Customer Success" overview yesterday</a>. Today, lets contrast customer support and customer success.</p><h2>Support vs. Success</h2><p>First, what's the difference between "customer support" and "customer success"?</p><p><a href="http://sixteenventures.com/customer-success-definition#support">Lincoln Murphey says</a>:</p><blockquote>Customer Success is proactively working our customers toward their Desired Outcome whereas Customer Support is reactive to customer’s break/fix issues.</blockquote><blockquote>Customer Support – specifically the number of interactions with the customer and how quickly those interactions are resolved – is a critical input into an overall Customer Health score (a key Customer Success metric). It’s pretty obvious that if customers can’t use the product, they can’t achieve their Desired Outcome.</blockquote><p>So, support is <em>reactive</em>, and success is <em>proactive</em>. This distinction is quick to cause frustration for support teams, because they feel like they're being taken down a notch.</p><p>In some companies, this is absolutely the case. Support is the low man on the totem poll, and it's not good for anyone.</p><h2>Cost Center or Profit Center?</h2><p>Support usually is <em>tolerated</em>, not <em>celebrated</em>. This difference has to do with the difference between a <em>cost center</em> and a <em>profit center</em>. (Being annoyed at this won't help you change the situation.)</p><p>A cost center is something that you have to have, and relucantly pay for it. Think "insurance" and "taxes". You pay for them because not paying for them is worse, but you don't actually enjoy it.</p><p>A <em>profit center</em> is a little machine that makes money. You put $X in, and it gives you $X+N. If you can double your input, theoretically you can double your output.</p><p>Companies live off of money. Money can beget more money, if spent in the right way. Money wasted means the company might go under.</p><p>Most companies view their support teams as a necessary evil. This is unfortunate, but this is also an <em>enormous</em> opportunity for a sufficiently motivated person on a support team to aim for driving massive change in their company.</p><h2>Turn the cost center into a profit center</h2><p>This will be a path of blood, sweat, and tears. I think its worth it, because whatever brave, enterprising soul masters this feat will be able to write his or her own ticket for the rest of their career. Forbes says <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/larrymyler/2013/02/14/be-a-hero-turn-a-cost-center-into-a-profit-center/#d3e869c6811e">you'll be a hero</a> if you can do this.</p><p>Forbes' take on it is limited, though. <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/tech-support-is-sales.html">Your support team is really your sales team</a>. So, build the metrics around this.</p><p>Support plays a huge roll in churn. If you can drive churn down, you're helping your company make money. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Effortless-Experience-Conquering-Battleground-Customer-ebook/dp/B00C5R73I8?ie=UTF8&amp;btkr=1&amp;ref_=dp-kindle-redirect">The Effortless Experience</a> covers this quite well.</p><p>If you decide to undertake this initiatve, you'll need to make a strong business case to the right people. This work will be good for your career, and very good for your company. If the last sentance didn't inspire you, go read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Smart-Like-How-Hidden-Success-ebook/dp/B0181C4N56">Smart Like How</a>, to learn to think really creatively on your career, and how you can shape it.</p><p>Whereever you can run against prevailing thought, you have a chance to carve out a big, valuable ownership of a topic.

      <title>Customer Success: American Airlines Case Study</title>
      <link>/blog/customer-success-american-airlines</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Continuing the theme of "what the heck do I do for work", <a target="_blank" href="http://josh.works/?category=Customer%20Success">I'm writing about Customer Success</a> as I see it. My words are my own, I don't speak for the industry as a whole, or even for Litmus. I'm just trying to sharpen my own thinking.</em></p><p class="text-align-center">* * *&nbsp;</p><p>Last time, I argued that <a href="http://josh.works/blog/success-is-not-support">customer success is not customer support</a>. I acknowledged that in general, customer support is seen as a cost center, and therefore is a necessary evil for most organizations.</p><p>I talked about why I disagree about the cost center assessment, and how someone in customer support could convince their executive team to view the support team as a profit center. That's a long and arduous road, and <em>most</em> organizations won't make the switch.</p><p>An enterprising individual can capitalize on this reluctance an organization has to view the support team in a better light, because that means theres tons of room to shine, get good experience under their belt, and leverage that data, knowledge, and perspective into a much better job for a new company.</p><h2>So what the heck is customer success?</h2><p><em>Update: I had an imaginary support interaction sketched out, but then I had a little kerfuffle with American Airlines today, so using that as my example story.</em></p><p>Think of everything your customer support team does. Now change the direction and timing of communication from customer&gt;support to support&gt;customer.</p><p>Here's a story that must happen a few hundred times a day with American Airlines:</p><p>I tried to check into a flight tomorrow. It was booked with miles, over the phone, and I modified it a few times (over the phone) since the original booking. It's from Barcelona&gt;Madrid&gt;Miami&gt;Philadelphia (oof).</p><p>I clicked the link in my email saying "Check in to your flight 24 hours before departure"</p>

<p>I got the following error code:</p>

<p> </p><p>This was this morning, on my phone, sitting in a <em>different</em> airport.</p><p>I became worried that there were problems with the flight, since I'd booked it and rebooked it and made modifications and cancelled the original itinerary. I didn't have time to sort it out then (sitting in an airport) so planned on fixing it later. ("Sort it out" invariably means having my laptop out, and 40 minutes to spend on the phone.)</p><p>Later, Kristi and I arrive to our apartment in Barcelona. We're eager to get out the door to explore the city (it was 5p already!) but I tell Kristi I need to try to sort out the check-in problem.</p><p>I try checking in on my computer, get this:</p>

<p> </p><p>OK, it said something about the partner airline in the email, so I head over to the Iberian checkin page:</p><p>Aaaand I get an uninspiring error message:</p>

       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="2006.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/57521272044262fce00bbcfc/1464996479634//img.png" alt=""It's not our fault this didn't work. Please talk to American" - Iberian Air"/> "It's not our fault this didn't work. Please talk to American" - Iberian Air[/caption]


<p> </p><p>Not good. I'm hoping my wife and I are going to get back to the US tomorrow. Per the instructions provided on the AA error page, I called <em>AA.com Web Services</em>.</p><p>To AA's credit, they answered fairly quickly. The first woman I spoke to hunted around for a few minutes on her computer, could not resolve the issue.</p><p>I was handed off to a reservation agent, who explained the problem.</p><p>She said (I'm roughly paraphrasing here):</p><blockquote>For award tickets booked through partner airlines, you have to check in at the airport. You're not able to check in online, because the systems don't talk to each other very well in the backend</blockquote><p>This is great news, and I can totally sympathize with data problems.</p><p>In short <strong>The system is functioning as expected, I simply cannot check in online. This has happened to me before, it will happen again. I'm happy to check in at the airport,&nbsp;<em>as long as I feel confident that I'll have a flight to check in TO!</em></strong></p><p>She offers to pass me through to Iberian air, just so I can talk with them. She gave me my <em>Iberian</em> record locator, though at this point, I was satisfied with the answer.</p><p>I took her up on the offer, and was passed along to Iberian. The woman from Iberian conveyed the same message, and I now feel at peace about flying back to the USA tomorrow.</p><h2>This is an expensive process for myself and American Airlines</h2><p>Lets summarize the cost:</p><ol><li>Three failed checkin attempts on different systems/devices (I tried at least 3x each time, so really, nine or ten failed checkin attempts)</li><li>Spoke to three different airline reps, over about fifteen minutes</li><li>Five hours of low-level stress on my behalf</li><li>Delayed our sightseeing in Barcelona by about thirty minutes.</li><li>Left a decidedly poor taste in my mouth about the airline</li></ol><p>Here's the kicker: All of this could have been avoided.</p><p>In the email containing my record locator, instead of the primary CTA being "Check in now" (in a poorly formatted, almost illegible email, by the way) they should have said:</p>

       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1626.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/57521338f850829dde1a16e2/1464996684818//img.png" alt="In the original email, that 2nd bullet was wasted by warning that the TSA is terrible."/> In the original email, that 2nd bullet was wasted by warning that the TSA is terrible.[/caption]


<p>That little line of text alone would have made me feel 10x better about what was coming.</p><p>Alternatively, they could have done a little work when I tried to check in online, too:</p>

The real one didn't say anything helpful."/> This is a *simulated* error message. The real one didn't say anything helpful.[/caption]


<p> </p><p>So, that was my poor experience, but does that mean American should actually do anything about this? After all, they've got limited resources, and many things to do. They cannot, and should not, try to fix every single little problem a customer has.</p><h2>IS THIS REALLY A PROBLEM?</h2><p>American <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aa.com/i18n/aboutUs/corporateInformation/facts/americanairlinesgroup.jsp">says</a> it flies ~6700 flights/day. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-average-amount-of-passengers-on-a-plane">Quora</a> guesses 150 people per plane, on average, so that works out to about a million people PER DAY flying on American or an affiliated airline.&nbsp;</p><p>I don't know the percentage of customers who experience the exact same work flow I experience. Lets assume it's 2%.</p><p>2% of a million people/day is 20,000. Lets assume 1/5 of them have a minor freakout and call American for help. That's 4000 people/day spending at least 15 minutes of a rep's time, figuring out what is going on. That is the equivalent of 1000 man hours/day spent on just this problem, or 30,000 man hours/month.</p><p>This 30,000 man hours/month is the the equivalent annual hours of over four full-time employees. Assuming their staff cost $15/hr to employ, this particular problem is burning about $500k/month in support hours alone.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, that's just the cost side of things. A half-million dollar/month problem seems big to you and I, but to a company bringing in $4 billion/year in profit, it's not a big deal.</p><p>The higher cost of this problem is to the customers who find it easy to move their spending to a different airline. Going back to those 20,000 people/day who experience this problem. Only 1/5 of them contacted American, which accounted for the $6m/year in staff payroll expense. That larger group spends, <a target="_blank" href="http://airlines.org/data/annual-round-trip-fares-and-fees-domestic/">on average</a>, $400/round trip ticket.&nbsp;</p><p>$400/ticket * 20,000 people/day * 365 days/year means this problem is "touching" about $2.9B a YEAR in spending. You should care deeply that they have a good experience with your airline.</p><p>So, by my math, yes, this is a problem and it should get development/marketing/support/billing resources to fix. Even if my math is all wrong, it's a starting point for the folks at American to decide how to fix this.&nbsp;</p><h2>Barriers to fixing this</h2><p dir="ltr">As you might assume, no fix is simple. Complexity plus "not my problem" plus "don't mess with my group" makes this a thorny problem. Here's a few reasons a fix would be hard to implement:</p><p><strong><em>Who owns the problem?</em></strong></p><p>If someone from American said "hm, yes, I agree, lets fix that" and implemented a fix, the fix would touch on much more than just a single team. You'd need:</p><ol><li>Developer work to redo the email templates to insert language about why online checkin is not available</li><li>Marketing/copywriting to decide on what language needs to be inserted</li><li>Marketing automation work to (perhaps) send a timely reminder email that says "in a few days, you might try to check in for your flight online, but you don't need to, because..."</li><li>Before/after analytics to track if this new method of handling the topic results in a decrease in support calls or an increase in "customer loyalty", however you choose to track it.</li></ol><p>So far, all of this is pretty straight forward, and anyone reading this should say "yeah, why wouldn't American do all of this?"</p><p>Great question. Here's the barriers to pushing something like this through:</p><p><strong>Who's problem is it?</strong></p><p>Who, in American, feels the pain from this problem?</p><p>Not support - they've got a long list of problems their customers face every day, that range from bugs, to feature requests, to confusing workflows.</p><p>This isn't a concern to the average product manager. It's a billing question, not something related to product.</p><p>Not the dev team. The error messages are populating as expected, and they built the checkin workflows to spec.</p><p>The customer will end up paying the invoice, so this problem isn't even costing the company any money.</p><p>It's not a problem for the marketing team. They have their own metrics to hit, and reducing numbers of calls to the service center is not on their radar.</p><h2>The success team makes the financial case for this</h2><p>This would be a problem that could be owned by the customer success team.</p><p>They'd discover it because they work closely with the support team. They'd figure out what the problem is (unmet expectations), and identify what pain it is causing for the company, and what pain it's causing for the customers.</p><p>They would track as a primary metric customer loyalty, and churn. They would be intimately aware that every time someone has to contact support and doesn't want to, that "costs" customer loyalty. It is much more painful for the customer than it is for the company. (This was fixed with 15 minutes spread out over three different reps. No big deal, but it cost me maybe 40 minutes of time, and five hours of stress.)</p><p>So, the customer success team can own the complicated fix. They'll figure out the spec of what needs to go in the dev pipeline, they'll get the copy approval from the marketing team, and they'll gather metrics from the support team about how often they hear from customers that might have this question.</p><p>They'll put open/click tracking in the notification emails that goes to the customers, to see if customers are opening the email, reading it, and clicking the call-to-action to gather more information.</p><p>They'll roll it out, and see if it results in a decrease in a number of calls to the support team.</p><p>Overall, they can advocate for the customer to all teams. This is how they get past the "nothing is broken" response from the dev team, or the "this isn't related to marketing" response from the marketing team. The support team will be onboard from the get-go.</p><p><em><strong>Hold on, Josh, you just painted the marketing and dev teams in a negative light. Of course they'll want to be responsive to pain the customers feel. You're being unfair.</strong></em></p><p>They're responsive to customer pain, and they're on the hook to do way more work than they can actually do. The dev team ALWAYS has an enormous to-do list, and they would be foolish to let just anyone stick more items into their list.</p><p>Same with the marketing team. They're busy, and don't have time to implement "good ideas" without knowing they will get a good ROI for their effort.</p><p>So the Success team can own the reasons, and will have an ongoing, trusting relationship with the dev and marketing teams. If the success team makes it a priority and owns most of the implementation, the other teams are happy to help.</p><h2>Who decides if this was a productive use of time?</h2><p>The marketing team looks at funnels. The dev team looks at features. The sales team looks at leads. The support team looks at tickets. The success team looks at the customers who have done nothing to warrant special attention, besides <em>paying you money</em>.</p><p>The goal of the customer success team is to ensure that the customer achieves his/her <a href="http://sixteenventures.com/customer-success-desired-outcome">Desired Outcome</a> with the minimum effort. This goal, if executed well, leads to many happy customers who pay you money and tell their friends/coworkers to do the same. I've already made the case that the worst-case impact of this problem is $2.9B/year. Even if I'm WAY off, this problem could still be impacting hundreds of millions in revenue. It needs to be fixed.</p><p><strong><em>Summary</em></strong></p><p>Traditionally, this general theme might fit under a User Experience role, but I think in a small-to-medium sized company, before they have a dedicated UX team, a fix like this could be owned by the success team, since they can advocate on behalf of the customers.</p><p>The Customer Success team can follow the needs of the customer wherever they might go, drawing on resources from anywhere in the company to deliver these solutions. Throughout, they are backed by the most important metric to a company: revenue.</p><p>It's a pretty exciting field to be in. Where else do you get to spend all day solving big problems for large numbers of people?</p><p><strong>Resources</strong></p><ul><li><a href="http://sixteenventures.com/customer-success-desired-outcome">Understanding Your Customer’s Desired Outcome</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

If they are looking for something that can be had <em>only</em>&nbsp;by going to college, they should do two things:</p><ol><li>Evaluate if the thing is really worth having</li><li>Determine if it can be had in any other way</li></ol><p>For example, so many people <em>still</em>&nbsp;stay the degree matters. "Oh, you can't get a certain job without having a degree" or "you can't get promoted beyond a certain level without a degree."</p><p>This may be true, in which case you've got research to do. Interview people who have done well for themselves, and find out how much of it could have happened without a degree.&nbsp;</p><p>Decide if it's possible that <em>you don't want to work for a company that requires a degree</em>.</p><p>Just because a job requires a degree doesn't mean that it requires a degree.&nbsp;A company that publishes this requirement often doesn't actually put it in practice, which means <em>you don't need a degree to work at that company. (See "signaling, qualifying applicants")</em></p><p>Conversely, you should not aspire to work at a company that <em>enforces</em>&nbsp;this requirement. College is mostly <a target="_blank" href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/11/the_magic_of_ed.html">signaling</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1985/12/the-case-against-credentialism/308286/">credentialism</a>. From <a target="_blank" href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/11/the_magic_of_ed.html">EconLib</a>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>According to the signaling model, employers reward educational success because of what it shows ("signals") about the student. &nbsp;Good students tend to be smart, hard-working, and conformist - three crucial traits for almost any job.</blockquote><p>So, if the value of college is because of the degree-as-signal component, do it as cheaply and quickly as possible. There is no other reasonable way to go.</p><p>If the value of college is in credentialism, go to the best college you can. (Harvard, Yale, MIT, or as close to those as you can get.)</p><p>If the value of college is in preparing you for a job by giving you practical skills that directly relate to future employment, take off the rose-colored glasses and think outside the box.&nbsp;</p><p>As I mentioned, there are plenty of good reasons to go to college, but it's too expensive and time consuming to not evaluate with a critical eye.</p><p>And yet, this year, millions of students are taking out billions of dollars in loans to fund four years of mediocre education to provide a degree that no one will care about, to get a job that allows them to pay off that loan sometime in the next fifteen years.</p><p>Full disclosure: I went to college. I was a poor student. I think I had a low B average, (I failed a class my last semester. oops).&nbsp;Besides meeting Kristi and some good friends, I'm hard pressed to find the value of my education. When I consider the opportunity cost, besides my wife and my friends, it was a huge net loss.&nbsp;</p><p>¯\_(ツ)_/¯&nbsp;</p><p>PPS Forward this to your favorite high schooler. Might save them a couple ten thousand dollars.</p><h3>Resources</h3><ul dir="ltr"><li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.doityourselfdegree.com/faqs/">DIY Degree</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOCs</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/">Scott Young's "MIT CompSci in a Year" challenge</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>12 Lessons Learned While Publishing Something Every Day for a Month</title>
      <link>/blog/12-lessons-learned-while-publishing-someone-every-day-for-a-month</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A month ago, I decided to publish something every day for at least thirty days. </p>
<p>I read a few others who did something similar, and discussed all the benefits. I've found myself struggling with creating something and then making it public. (Public here, on another project, or at work.)</p>
<p>I also had a bit of a backlog of ideas or a scattered few paragraphs on a topic. In my head, these would all turn into comprehensive tomes that would be the end-all resource on a subject. With those expectations, I would never, ever write them.</p>
<p>So, here we are, thirty one published posts later (this is #32), and in no specific order, is what I've learned:</p>
<h3 id="writing-every-day-is-time-consuming-">Writing every day is time consuming.</h3>
<p>I didn't pre-write anything, though I did regularly add ideas to a running list of potential posts, so every day I'd sit down and write, format, edit (sometimes) and publish in one sitting. I rarely finished anything in less than 30 minutes.</p>
<h3 id="much-of-what-i-wrote-felt-self-indulgent-or-low-value-">Much of what I wrote felt self-indulgent, or low-value.</h3>
<p>Since I was just firing off whatever popped into my head (more or less), I wasn't using any external indicators of what would be useful to readers.</p>
<h3 id="writing-begets-writing">Writing begets writing</h3>
<p>I started this project with ten ideas I wanted to "clear off my plate". Thirty posts later, my list of things to write about is now thirty items long. Oops. </p>
<h3 id="i-care-a-lot-about-metrics-but-have-very-little-to-show-for-it">I care a lot about metrics, but have very little to show for it</h3>
<p>I got 20-50 unique visitors a day. Here's my good-sounding reason for wanting visitors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to create something useful and valuable, and <em>if</em> something is useful and valuable, then I can be more useful in the world by reaching more people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's the more selfish and accurate reason:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to think of myself as someone who creates useful and valuable things, and look to the external validation of high numbers of readers. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a bunch of other benefits <em>to me</em> of "traffic", so I'll unashamedly say I want to grow my audience.</p>
<p>(I put "traffic" in quotes because it's not traffic, it's people giving a minute or two of their day to me. This is a pretty big deal.)</p>
<h3 id="i-don-t-want-to-rely-on-any-external-source-platform-for-traffic">I don't want to rely on any external source/platform for traffic</h3>
<p>For now, the only metric I care about is email subscribers. That means that until that person unsubscribes, that person is willing to have me in their inbox, and my ability to talk to them is not linked to the search algorithems of any ofther tool. Facebook is notorious at showing things you post to only a few other people, and Twitter is moving in the same direction.</p>
<h3 id="specialization-will-allow-me-to-help-more-people-">Specialization will allow me to help more people.</h3>
<p>If I want to grow an audience, I can, they just need to know why the heck I'm writing, and if they want that, they'll subscribe, and if they don't, they won't.</p>
<p>That's not possible right now, as I'm not focused on any particular thing in my writing. This might change down the road, but for now, I don't plan on niching down into a specific domain. </p>
<p>I've already got a platform for writing about climbing (and can generate thousands of page views a day linking out useful things (like <a href="http://www.climbersguide.co/the-only-core-exercises-youll-ever-need-upgrade/">a video about core strength</a>) to reddit.)</p>
<p>Honestly, writing every day distracted me from work I was doing for The Climber's Guide. I began working again on TCG after I started writing on here every day, though, so I still strongly believe that <em>creating begets creating</em>. I was struggling to write regularly, so I started writing every day, and all of a sudden had a bunch more things to write about.</p>
<p>It was only after I was writing regularly that I got the idea to film a video course of dealing with fear while rock climbing. I'm officialy transitioning from writing here every day to writing more for <a href="http://climbersguide.co/conquer-fear-course">TGC Fear Course</a> (not the finished title.) Punch in your email address there (or here, in the top-right corner) for updates as we go. </p>
<h3 id="lists-get-views-or-at-least-good-article-titles-do">Lists get views, or at least good article titles do</h3>
<p>The top-performing posts of the month were <em><a href="http://josh.works/blog/what-ive-learned-from-cooking-in-36-kitchens-in-the-last-year">Lessons Learned from cooking in 36 Kitches in the last year</a></em> and <em><a href="http://josh.works/blog/62-lessons-learned-after-year-of-full-time-travel">62 Lessons Learned after one year of full time travel</a></em>. Only two data points, but something made it click a bit more. I think they are far the most interesting things I posted in the last month, but they also had good subject lines. And had numbers in the titles. </p>
<p>As a counterpoint <em><a href="http://josh.works/blog/ok-some-new-books">OK, Some New Books</a></em> is not exactly a riveting and enticing subject line. </p>
<h3 id="doing-anything-challenging-for-a-period-of-time-is-a-rewarding-challenge">Doing anything challenging for a period of time is a rewarding challenge</h3>
<p>I'm quite pleased to have completed this 30 days of writing. When I look at my <a href="http://josh.works/archives">archives page</a>, I'm pleased to see a lot of items for this year. I wrote that. It's a little flag planted on my tiny corner of the internet, and every single post was at least loosly aimed to be helpful to others. So, this wasn't complaining about things that annoy me (though <a href="http://josh.works/blog/customer-success-american-airlines">I talked about American Airline's poor UX</a>). I'm reasonably pleased with putting words down.</p>
<h3 id="i-don-t-know-what-it-looks-like-to-find-your-voice-but-i-don-t-think-i-need-it">I don't know what it looks like to find "your voice", but I don't think I need it</h3>
<p>Lots of people talk about needing to find "your voice" as a critical step to... something. <a href="http://goinswriter.com/you-have-a-voice/">This might be true</a>, but <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/11/finding-your-voice-as-a-writer-overrated/382946/">I don't believe it to matter much</a>. I write for fun (on this website) and sometimes for what will some day be for profit (Climber's Guide) and I write plenty for work (to coworkers and to customers, both in email and much more durable, lasting ways). None of this has been held back by me not knowing what "my voice" is. </p>
<p>Maybe some day I'll look back and say "ah, I found my voice right <em>there</em>!" and stab a date on the calendar. I think what that really will mean is "I became comfortable with the written word, and others found value in what I created."</p>
<p>For example, I've made a few videos to help climbers in a few different ways. I've gotten quite a bit of positive feedback from it. I wanted to say "ah, that there, was written in <em>my voice</em>, and that's why it was so popular."</p>
<p>Except that's not true. Things that are valuable are valuable because they convey useful information. My skills with the written word are incidental. (Copywriting is enormously valuable, but that's not "finding your voice", that's "the psychology of persuasion").</p>
<h3 id="distractions-are-everywhere-and-i-get-crushed-when-it-s-just-a-few-keystrokes-away-">Distractions are everywhere, and I get crushed when it's just a few keystrokes away.</h3>
<p><a href="https://selfcontrolapp.com/">Self-control</a> (the app) is awesome. As is <a href="http://www.focusapp.io/#focus-ios">focus.io</a>. Coupled with <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> and the right <a href="https://heyfocus.com/scripting-focus-with-os-x-url-handlers/">workflow</a>, you can lock yourself out of distraction with just six keystrokes. (for me it's cmd-space, then "f-o-c" to enable Focus). </p>
<h3 id="someday-i-ll-embrace-editing-but-it-s-not-yet-">Someday I'll embrace editing, but it's not yet.</h3>
<p>This is probably obvious. I write things filled with errors, poorly-worded sentances, exessive use of the passive voice (see what I did there) and lots of other mistakes that would cut it in a professional setting. This isn't professional, so here we are. </p>
<h3 id="make-more-asks-">Make more asks.</h3>
<p>I'm going to ask things more often, or make more requests. </p>
<p>Here's my first request:</p>
<p>Will you give me your email address? In the top right corner of this page is a box for your email. Put it in there, and next time you get an email, send me a reply. I'll put more instructions in the email then.</p>
<p>Until next time (but not tomorrow, because I'm done writing every day),</p>
<p>-Josh</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Ruby Tutorial 001</title>
      <link>/blog/ruby-tutorial-001</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm playing with <a href="http://www.michaelhartl.com/">Michael Hartl's</a> <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning#sec-installing_rails">Learn Enough Ruby</a> book. </p>
<p>I'll throw basic things I learn along the way on here. </p>
<p>A good starting point is using your command line. I use <a href="https://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a> for my terminal instead of the default Terminal installation. </p>
<p>To get up and running in your terminal, you <em>might</em> start using <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>. It'll install programs you will want/need easily, and keep them up to date. Lots of tools you need have installation instructions that says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To install:<br><code>brew install wget</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which means, in your terminal, type <code>brew wget</code> and Homebrew will install the application, all dependencies, <em>and will keep it up to date</em>. </p>
<p>How do you install Homebrew? Per their instructions, copy-paste the following to your terminal:</p>
<p><code>/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)</code></p>
<p>So, your first program to download can be iTerm2. Once brew is installed, type this into your terminal:</p>
<p><code>brew install iterm2</code></p>
<p>And you've got it installed!  </p>

      <title>Three Android Apps I Use Every Day (and maybe you'll use them too)</title>
      <link>/blog/three-android-apps-i-use-every-day-and-maybe-youll-use-them-too</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm not here to talk about Twitter and Instagram, which... I use too much. Lets talk about things that make my life better, and might do the same for you.</p>
<p>(If you're an iPhone user, just Google for the iOS version of the following tools. They're all out there)</p>
<h2 id="rewire-app-recurring-behavior-tracking">Rewire App: "Recurring behavior" tracking</h2>
<p>I wrote "Habit tracking" originally, but I don't like that phrasing. I'm all for good habits, or eliminating bad ones, but I don't think you should try to form a new habit until you've figured out <a href="http://josh.works/blog/2013/05/03/intentional-habit-building">how to make it really, really easy</a>. </p>
<p>So, I use <a href="http://www.rewireapp.io/" title="Rewire App">Rewire</a> to simply track the status of things I'd like to pay attention too. <em>I'm not trying to make new habits</em>. I just want to see how often I do something on its own.</p>
<p>When I do the thing I want to do, I mark that day's habit as "complete". If I don't, I don't mark it as "failed", I just mark it as "skipped". This is a tiny way I can <a href="http://josh.works/blog/2014/07/19/be-gentle-to-you">be gentle to myself</a>.</p>
<h2 id="journey-app-daily-gratitude">Journey App: Daily gratitude</h2>
<p>I write a little  bit every day. Three things every day, and never with the intention of publishing them.</p>
<p>Between <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Slight-Edge-Turning-Disciplines-Massive/dp/193594486X">The Slight Edge</a></em> and _<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Miracle-Morning-Not-So-Obvious-Guaranteed-Transform-ebook/dp/B00AKKS278/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1467616556&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=micracle+morning">The Miracle Morning</a>_ and many other books, and endless articles, I've finally been convinced about the benefit of finding a few things every day to be thankful for. Three things, specifically.</p>
<p>For a long time I used <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-keep-notes-and-lis/hmjkmjkepdijhoojdojkdfohbdgmmhki?hl=en">Google Keep</a> to track all my items, but it became laggy once I had a few hundred lines of text in it. So, I hunted around, and found <a href="http://2appstudio.com/journey/" title="Journey App">Journey</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://2appstudio.com/journey/" title="Journey App">Journey</a> is an Android (and windows) app + Chrome extension for "daily journaling". I just open it up (usually on my phone, as I go to sleep, other times on the Chrome extension) and I jot down three things I'm thankful for. </p>
<p>The only rules are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Always three things</li>
<li>No repeats</li>
</ol>
<p>I enjoy having to be a little creative to make sure I don't repeat things, and it's really encouraging to scroll down through hundreds of little tiny (and sometimes big) things I was (and am) thankful for. </p>
<h2 id="phoneusage-don-t-waste-your-life">PhoneUsage: Don't waste your life</h2>
<p>Apparently, no one has heard of this app. Lifehacker, CNET, Gizmodo, and others all have pretty terrible recommendations for apps that tell you how much you use your phone. I'd know - I tried what they recommended, was frustrated, and then finally found <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pt.aguiar.phoneusage" title="PhoneUsage App">PhoneUsage</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pt.aguiar.phoneusage">PhoneUsage</a> does exactly what you'd expect: </p>
<ul>
<li>Tells you how much total time you spend with your phone "on". (I use quotes because talking on the phone counts, even though the screen is off.)</li>
<li>Tells you how many times you turned your screen on (total #sessions, and also the number of "quick checks". I don't know how it qualifies one from the other.)</li>
<li>How much you use each app</li>
<li>Lots more. </li>
</ul>
<p>I love it. I look at it at least once a day, sometimes more. I think it helps me subtly move towards less frivolous time spent on my phone. </p>

      <title>Avoid a car accident with a $3 tool</title>
      <link>/blog/avoid-a-car-accident-with-a-3-tool</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>TL;DR: Buy a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fit-System-C0400-Passenger-Adjustable/dp/B001DKT0DO/ref=sr_1_3?s=automotive&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1467648316&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=blind+spot+mirror">blind spot mirror</a> for your car. They are $2, and can keep you from getting in an accident. Not a lot of people have them, though they're awesome.</strong></p>
<p>I spend an inordinate amount of time thinking about how to make driving safer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 to making driving safer is "don't drive".</strong> (See also "increasing safety while wrestling with alligators" and "increasing safety with home-made parachutes"). </p>
<p>Assuming you'll drive, the next advice is "don't be human". The most common cause of car accidents is <a href="https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2013/12/human-error-cause-vehicle-crashes">human error</a>. </p>
<p>Since Tesla has not taken over the world yet, we'll still be in charge of our own vehicles for at least a little while longer.</p>
<p>A significant sub-set of human-error accidents is "Unsafe Lane Changes". Of these accidents, many are related to <a href="http://papers.sae.org/2012-01-0261/">not using a turn signal</a>. (I couldn't find a free version of the study, but everyone and their mother has cited this SAE report.)</p>
<p>So, it's estimated that failure to use turn signals contributes to about 2 million roadway collisions every year. </p>
<p>The most obvious place where a turn signal can cause a problem is changing lanes on a highway, where a car might be in your blind spot. Even if you use your turn signal, the other driver might not see you there, or, worse, you and the other driver might try to change into the same lane, from opposite sides. </p>
<p><strong>Blind spot mirrors are an embarrassingly cheap partial solution.</strong></p>
<p>I've used these <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fit-System-C0400-Passenger-Adjustable/dp/B001DKT0DO/ref=sr_1_3?s=automotive&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1467648316&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=blind+spot+mirror">$2.11 blind spot mirrors</a> for years. </p>
<p>These <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cardeco-Moving-Circle-Universal-Vehicles/dp/B00EVMT6A8/ref=sr_1_4?s=automotive&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1467648316&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=blind+spot+mirror">rimless mirrors</a> look even nicer, but cost MORE THAN TWICE AS MUCH at $7.16.</p>
<p>Order one or the other. The price is insignificant, peace of mind and not getting in an expensive and/or dangerous and/or time-consuming car accident is worth it.</p>
<p>BTW, I don't do affiliate links. I just thought of this as I drove from Denver to Seattle, and started trying to find cars with blind spot mirrors. There are not as many out there as there should be.</p>

      <title>Wrapping my head around local politics 001</title>
      <link>/blog/wrapping-my-head-around-local-politics-001</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Warning: Buzzwords ahead about millennials.*</p><blockquote><p>As a millennial, I want to “get involved” in my “local community”, and don’t know the best way to “mobilize my resources”.</p></blockquote><p><em>vomit</em>. I hate admitting that. But I still want to figure out <em>if</em>&nbsp;it is possible for me (little old me) to do something meanigful in the arena of local politics. (<a href="http://www.strongtowns.org/the-growth-ponzi-scheme/">Here’s a rough overview of what I’d like accomplished</a>)</p><p>So, what does any resourceful person do?</p><p>I headed to Google and searched for:</p><ul><li>"politics for millennials"</li><li>"local politics for millennials"</li><li>"young people involved in local politics"</li></ul><p>The results (or, judging by the top five hits for each search) are totally underwhelming. Here’s a few:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/the-liberal-millennial-revolution/470826/">The Liberal Millennial Revolution</a></li><li><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/derrick-feldmann/millennials-causes-the-el_b_10731378.html">Millennials, Causes And The Election: How Millennials’ Perspectives Of Personal Impact And Activism Change In An Election Year</a></li><li><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/22/millennials-in-congress_n_4325417.html">Millennials Won’t Be In Charge Of Congress Until At Least 2035</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/sponsored/allstate/when-it-comes-to-politics-do-millennials-care-about-anything/255/">When It Comes to Politics, Do Millennials Care About Anything?</a></li><li><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-hanley/how-to-get-more-young-peo_b_8562196.html">How to Get More Young People Involved in Politics</a></li></ul><h3>Themes from articles about Millennials</h3><p>I’m generalizing, but I noticed a few themes:</p><ol><li>Millennials get lumped together.</li><li>Millennials are still considered an outgroup. (It seems a lot of people writing <em>about</em>millennials, to other people who are not part of that group.)</li><li>The “departure from the norm” of voting engagement/preference of millennials is implicitly a result of their youth or liberalism, rather than a reasonable assessment of the political system.</li></ol><p>I’m going to go out on a limb here, borrowing from pretty straight-forward realities behind education:</p><p><em>People care about things that matter to them, and will go to great efforts to pursue their own interests, and are nearly impossible to motivate in any other way.</em></p><p>Please see: school. (I steadfastly resisted learning anything that I didn’t want to learn about. Conversely, something I want to learn about, I will pour myself into learning.)</p><p>In other words, a perceived disinterest in politics <em>is not a reflection of millennials</em>, it’s a reflection of “the system”.</p><h3>Defining Politics?</h3><p>Lets define politics:</p><ol><li>“Politics” is loosely correlated to organizing life around ourselves to care for the common good. (Not the official definition, just my working definition.)</li><li>“Politics” is wrangling between elites to bring about things that make them feel good, while talking down to us common folk.</li></ol><p>Regarding “politics as a tool of the elite”,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/741584993009438720">this</a>&nbsp;Snowden quote seems appropriate:</p><blockquote><p>Politics: the art of convincing decent people to forget the lesser of two evils is also evil.</p></blockquote><p>Those two interpretations of the word “politics” are irreconcilable, and when people complain that millennials are not involved in “politics”, they usually seem to be referring to #2. (Anytime someone says voting is a “duty”, that <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2012/10/27/jacoby/PiV0sbV2bXf6OQAToXalxM/story.html">should be a red flag</a>)</p><p>I don’t care at all about “politics”, but I care a lot about how people are treated by other people.</p><p>This fits into two groups:</p><ol><li>How people of equal power treat each other</li><li>How people of unequal power treat each other</li></ol><p>People with power can tell people without power what they can and cannot do.

      <title>October 2016 Goals</title>
      <link>/blog/october-2016-goals</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the last year, I've fluctuated between writing <em>every day for 30 days</em> and <em>not posting once in two months</em>. </p>
<p>Frankly, neither of those is good for me. </p>
<p>I like writing because it clarifies my own thoughts. Sometimes it seems useful to others. I like to be useful ("utility" can often correspond with "market value", which sometimes corresponds with $$$) and I like to think clearly.</p>
<h1 id="projects">Projects</h1>
<p>I've got three open projects right now:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Learn back-end web development.</strong> (ew. a huge and complicated and ill-defined goal)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Launch a three-tiered course/offering about <em>how to climb without fear</em> over on <a href="http://climbersguide.co/">climbersguide.co</a>.</strong> (Much less complicated, much more defined, than #1)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Climb 5.13.</strong> This has been a goal for ages. {excuse1} {excuse 2} {excuse 3}. With those excuses out of the way, 5.13 is a meaningful grade to me. Mostly, it's quite hard climbing. 5.13 is not hard to <em>really really good</em> rock climbers, but at least it gets a shrug from them, so it's good enough for me. (Simplest and best defined of all goals.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-did-i-title-this-thing-october-">Why did I title this thing "October"?</h2>
<p>I can have one meaningful goal in each of these projects, and spend the rest of the month working on it. At the end of the month, I can post an update, and then sketch out the next month of work.</p>
<p>This cadence might be that sweet spot of "writing for clarity and understanding" without tipping into "writing for the sake of writing". </p>
<p>To that end, here's my stab at what might be progress for the rest of the month in each domain:</p>
<p><strong>Programming</strong></p>
<p>I'll finish Hartle's <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org">Rails Tutorial</a>, and move on to another walk-through of a specific app. <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tbh">TBH</a>, I don't feel like I've learned too much from the tutorial, because so much of what I'm doing is going way over my head.</p>
<p>I'm punching in code in the right places, and making the tests turn green, but I've got a ways to go for really understanding what I'm doing. </p>
<p>Fortunately, this is a solvable problem, so it doesn't concern me at all.</p>
<p><strong>Climber's Guide course</strong></p>
<p>Oh man. Do you want to undertake a project that makes you question your value as a person, everyone's assessment of you, and make you wonder if you're a terrible person?</p>
<p>Great. Launch a course that you will try to get people to pay you a lot of money for.</p>
<p>More real-talk: The price-points I'm aiming for are roughly:</p>
<ol>
<li>$50 - Basic</li>
<li>$150 - Middle</li>
<li>$300 - Premium</li>
</ol>
<p>That's right. {scream emoji}. This is <em>a lot of money</em>. I'm going to ask people to pay me it. </p>
<p>Part of the pricing is because that's what the product + offerings is worth. Part of it is the anchoring effect.</p>
<p><em>Quick - is $50 a lot of money? You'll probably say "no" because you just read the price of $300. So, $50 is cheap. What if I said I was offering a course for $10, $25, and $50? Now you'd say $50 is expensive. Probably.</em></p>
<p>The scary thing is... I think it'll be worth it. But again, there's that thorny problem of "value, self-esteem, confidence" raising it's ugly head. </p>
<p>So, next step? </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Record a bunch of videos talking people through the program, step by step.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Send more regular emails to everyone that's on the list. I've got about 250 email subscribers that I've not emailed in a few months. Oops. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Furiously google's "Reengagement campaign". Fortunately, I work at a company that <a href="https://litmus.com/blog/3-steps-to-successful-subscriber-reengagement">knows how to handle this sort of situation</a></em></p>
<p>(I'd like to "launch" this course to a list of at least 500. I've got other projects in the pipe for that...)</p>
<p>I already have most of the videos done (the videos of the actual climbing.) What I'm missing is the "Josh talks into a camera and explains what's going on". </p>
<p>I need to annotate the videos, make it <em>extremely clear</em> whatever it is I'm trying to teach.</p>
<p>It'll so be worth the money. I can help the right person climb 2-3 grades harder almost overnight. That same person will spend $300 on a new rope and $150 on cool climbing shoes that will help them climb (maybe) one grade harder. </p>
<p>It's still sticky and uncomfortable. But that means it's good for me, right?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p><strong>Climbing 5.13</strong></p>
<p>There's a nice book written about <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006YOJMSC/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">how to climb 5.12</a>. (I just noticed the cover image is from <em>Jesus Wept</em>, 5.12d, Red River Gorge. Fantastic climb, though those two-finger pockets are challenging.)</p>
<p>Climbing 5.12 is <a href="http://www.climbing.com/skills/your-goal-climb-512a/">most likely within the genetic potential of almost every person alive today</a>. That doesn't make it <em>easy</em>, it just means "your genes will not make it impossible for you to climb 5.12 with enough time, training, and at the right BMI"</p>
<p>5.13 is four grades harder than 5.12, which is... generally considered hard. I've had mixed success with 5.12. I've <a href="http://eveningsends.com/onsight-climbing-tips-sport-climbers/">onsighted</a> up to 5.12b, and projected... maybe a few 5.12cs. This is a pretty bad "spread" between the onsight grade and project grade.</p>
<p>Traditionally, you should be projecting about four grades harder than you can onsight. I project one grade harder than I onsight. (Oh, you thought 5.14 was a reasonable goal? <a href="http://eveningsends.com/how-to-climb-5-14-the-simple-way/">hah</a>.)</p>
<p>Why is this? Am I <em>really really</em> good at onsighting? Not at all. I am <em>comically bad</em> at remembering my beta. ("Beta" is just the sequence of hand and foot movements that you use to move through sections of a climb)</p>
<p>Generally, the first time you get on a climb, you're going to make some mistakes, as well as learn more efficient ways to climb. ("The 2nd left-hand crimp is terrible. Bump to the more incut hold, and then highstep your right foot to a hand-foot match on the right")</p>
<p>I cannot remember this stuff at all. If I do the same climb three times in a row, I'll have probably climbed it three different ways. I'm basically re-onsighting climbs, over and over and over.</p>
<p>So, if I want to climb better/harder, the obvious next step is remember my beta.</p>
<p>I feel like this might be related to my generally horrific ability to visualize things in general. I've noticed when I read books with vivid landscape depictions, I gain <em>nothing</em> from reading them, because my "minds eye" doesn't do anything.</p>
<p>I just read books for content, plot advancement, etc. I'm bad at visualizing faces (I'm bad with names, too), and when I look hard enough, I find evidence of a severely under-trained "minds eye".</p>
<p><em>google's "how to train your mind's eye"</em> Wow. That got weird quick. Nevermind.</p>
<p><strong>So, next steps for climbing training?</strong></p>
<p>I'm going to start writing out a "sequence log" of the difficult parts of routes/boulder problems, and see if I can follow my intended sequences over time. </p>

      <title>Quitting the shallow for the deep</title>
      <link>/blog/i-quit</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="deep-work-over-shallow">Deep work over shallow</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: I'm off social media, but want to keep a functioning Twitter URL. So, it redirects here.</strong></p>
<p>This year's "best book I've read" label <em>might</em> go to Cal Newport's <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692">Deep Work</a></em>.</p>
<p>Here's the gist:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>One of the most valuable skills in our economy is becoming increasingly rare. If you master this skill, you'll achieve extraordinary results.</strong></p>
<p>Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It's a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time. Deep work will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship. In short, deep work is like a super power in our increasingly competitive twenty-first century economy. And yet, most people have lost the ability to go deep-spending their days instead in a frantic blur of e-mail and social media, not even realizing there's a better way.</p>
<p>In DEEP WORK, author and professor Cal Newport flips the narrative on impact in a connected age. Instead of arguing distraction is bad, he instead celebrates the power of its opposite. Dividing this book into two parts, he first makes the case that in almost any profession, cultivating a deep work ethic will produce massive benefits. He then presents a rigorous training regimen, presented as a series of four "rules," for transforming your mind and habits to support this skill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I often feel <em>terrible</em> at owning and directing my own attention. Yet, this ability is one of the most significant factors over on-going professional success <em>and project-related satisfaction</em>. </p>
<p>(I differentiate the two because you can have professional success without much satisfaction, and probably vice versa. I want both.)</p>
<p>I've a bunch of other reasons for wanting to develop these skills, but reading <em>Deep Work</em> helped clarify something about why a goal I accomplished a few years ago was so satisfying.</p>
<p>The context: I was working in DC in an uninspiring and low-paid role. I was commuting about an hour each way. Kristi and I wanted to move, and I wanted a better job. I didn't feel like I "deserved" a better job, just that I'd not yet accomplished the dual efforts of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Being more valuable</li>
<li>Finding a role where I could deliver that additional value.</li>
</ol>
<p>If I could accomplish these goals, I could find a great company, and do that work remotely. </p>
<p>Put another way, if I could accomplish these goals, <em>Kristi and I could move to Colorado with a job in hand.</em> To someone who's grown up in the climbing community, this is akin to going to heaven. </p>
<p>In hindsight, this powerful goal motivated me to do <em>deep work.</em> I spent many, many hours immersed deep in a range of projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Who are industry-leaders in the customer support world? I got to know them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Could I show that I'd help improve the efforts my entire team? If not, figure out how, and then do it. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Could I add valuable skills to my "toolchest"? I think so. I went deep on Excel, so I could collect/display data better. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Can I communicate in writing better? Probably. Learn by doing, so I started writing. Lots. <a href="http://josh.works/epic-quest">Sample</a>. <a href="http://josh.works/blog/2013/08/12/20-things-20-year-olds-dont-get">Sample</a>. <a href="http://josh.works/blog/2013/08/20/things-you-cant-do-from-behind-a-computer-pt-1">Sample</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I studied just about everything Ramit Sethi wrote on getting jobs. (<a href="http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/the-8020-guide-to-finding-a-job-you-love/">Here's a great place to start.</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And I did all of this most days between the hours of 4:45a - 7:15a. Because after I went to work and got back at 6:30p, I was exhausted. </p>
<p>I've not poured myself into projects with quite that same intensity for a while, in part, because it's easy to get distracted. And I don't have quite the same audacious goals that I did then.</p>
<p><strong>To make space for deep work, I'm removing "the shallows" from my easy reach. I've not used Facebook much over the last two years, but it'll stay deleted. Instagram I'm removing from my phone, and Twitter - I'm locking myself out of it, removing it from my phone.</strong></p>
<p>That is all. I might update this a bit more as I go, but for now - I've taken all the time I've allotted to write this, and it's on to the next thing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>October 2016 Review</title>
      <link>/blog/october-2016-review</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>October 2016 Review</h1><p>This month's review. In another few days I'll post the goals for November.</p><p>I had <a href="https://josh.works/blog/october-2016-goals">three goals for October</a>, as of about 12 days ago:</p><h2>October goals:</h2><h3>Programming</h3><p>I wanted to finish a certain Rails Tutorial, and move on to the next one. This project I made zero progress on. But I'm accepted into the <a href="https://www.turing.io/">Turing School's</a> January 2017 cohort, and have approval from my company for a long (unpaid) sabbatical for the course.</p><p>So, I'm making progress, and as importantly, I've got big pieces of this squared away over the next few months.</p><p>I'd like to reach a point of stability and completeness on my next bullet point (the climber's guide) before throwing myself into programming training.</p><h3>Climber's Guide Course</h3><p>I made good progress here. I finally got <a href="http://climbersguide.co/">the website</a>&nbsp;I'm using into a viewable form (the old theme I had was hideous).</p><p>I updated some of the email collection forms (there's now a sidebar, ready to collect someone's email address) and I linked to a "best of" sidebar section, linking to some useful articles.</p><p>I added an "about me" and "contact me" page, and then most importantly,&nbsp;<em>stripped out everything else</em>. There's no footer, there's no public meta data about every post, there's no stupid nav bar that every theme shoves down your throat.</p><p><a href="http://www.climbersguide.co">www.climbersguide.co</a>&nbsp;is, from a visual perspective,&nbsp;<em>boring</em>. And I wouldn't take it any other way.</p><p>I started fleshing out a bunch of blog posts, either moving over things I've written for <em>this</em>&nbsp;website, or other ideas I had floating around in my head.</p><p>This is the requisite leg-work to get the website ready to receive traffic, and hopefully capture (in the form of email subscribers) some of those views.</p><p>The email list and drip campaigns is where all the good stuff is, so I'll turn my attention to that next month.</p><h3>Climbing 5.13</h3><p>Made great progress here. Just a few hours ago, I sent <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/anarchitect/105750721">Anarchitect (5.12d)</a>.</p><p>I got it on my seventh attempt, though I came extremely close (slipped off the last hold) to sending it on my fourth attempt.</p><p>This was the most work I've put into a climb ever. It's also the hardest grade I've sent, and I'm not sure if I ever actually climbed 5.12c. (I've been on plenty of them, but usually don't give climbs more than one or two attempts...)</p><p>Some of the lessons:</p><p><strong>Lesson One: There is an insane amount of optimization you can do in a route</strong>. My first attempt on this climb, I fell on almost every move, from the first bolt to the last.</p><p><strong>Lesson Two: I'm horrible at remembering my own beta.</strong>&nbsp;A friend of mine who has an <em>excellent</em>&nbsp;ability to recall his own beta, and others, and adjust it on the fly, upon seeing my climbing said "It's as if every time you climb a route, it's your first time."</p><p>This inability to recall beta has been holding me back for a while. My on-sight ability has gone up and up, but my ability to project a route is horrific.</p><p>So, this time around, I made a "beta map". I just jotted down every move of the climb, and added some notes about my sequences.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/xwqtdmshoufjnfc/Anarchitect%2012d%2010-2016%20Beta%20map.pdf?dl=0">This is what mine looked like</a></p><p>The process of recalling enough of my movement to make this map, as well as playing back through every move to recall the ideal sequence, is <em>exactly what I need</em>. As I climbed the route again after making it (the next day) I was comparing every move I made with what I'd outlined in the map.</p><p>In almost every instance, I had recalled the correct movement. My map worked.</p><p>So, I'll keep making these maps. I hope to improve my "beta recall", and even on climbs where I don't make the map, I'll become more perceptive of my own movement up the route.</p><p><strong>Lesson Three: It's important to try hard.</strong>&nbsp;I almost sent the route my fourth attempts, but I fell off because I simply didn't try on the last move. This is a horrible habit I've picked up in my climbing, and it's sneaky. See, you can always try to be stronger, or climb more efficiently, and these are good things, but at the end of the day - if you can try really <em>really</em>&nbsp;hard, you can make more progress than someone who doesn't.</p><p><strong>Lesson Four: I've gotten better at rock climbing in the last few years.</strong>&nbsp;It's been ages since I've had a solid indicator that I've improved as a climber. In the last five years, I've spent almost three of them not climbing regularly, and just trying to train a bit on my own. Due to seasons and travel, all of my "progress" has been inside, on gym routes. Gym routes have little relationship to outdoor climbs, and they're not internally consistent <em>or</em>&nbsp;consistent across time.</p><p>So, I know I've been <em>feeling</em>&nbsp;stronger, but I didn't have proof. Now I do. I'm going to aim for a few more 5.12ds and 12cs, but I think I'm going to hop on <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/v/sonic-youth/105749158">Sonic Youth</a>&nbsp;next. It might be a "soft" 5.13a, but supposedly some broken holds in 2010 made it solid for the grade.</p><p>November goals, coming soon.</p>]]></content:encoded>
      <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This month's review. In another few days I'll post the goals for November.</p><p>I had <a href="https://josh.works/blog/october-2016-goals">three goals for October</a>, as of about 12 days ago:</p><h2>October goals:</h2><h3>Programming</h3><p>I wanted to finish a certain Rails Tutorial, and move on to the next one. This project I made zero progress on. But I'm accepted into the <a href="https://www.turing.io/">Turing School's</a>&nbsp;January 2017 cohort, and have approval from my company for a long (unpaid) sabbatical for the course.</p><p>So, I'm making progress, and as importantly, I've got big pieces of this squared away over the next few months.</p><p>I'd like to reach a point of stability and completeness on my next bullet point (the climber's guide) before throwing myself into programming training.</p><h3>Climber's Guide Course</h3><p>I made good progress here. I finally got <a href="http://climbersguide.co/">the website</a>&nbsp;I'm using into a viewable form (the old theme I had was hideous).</p><p>I updated some of the email collection forms (there's now a sidebar, ready to collect someone's email address) and I linked to a "best of" sidebar section, linking to some useful articles.</p><p>I added an "about me" and "contact me" page, and then most importantly,&nbsp;<em>stripped out everything else</em>. There's no footer, there's no public meta data about every post, there's no stupid nav bar that every theme shoves down your throat.</p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

      <title>November 2016 Goals</title>
      <link>/blog/f23wrr3boior18oo14ih6v2lo0suz6</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>November 2016 Goals</h1><p><em>Note to the reader: The words that follow are all about me. Very naval-gaze-ish. I feel I owe you this warning.</em></p><p>My November goals are an extension of my <a href="https://josh.works/blog/october-2016-goals">October goals</a>.</p><p>October was good (<a href="https://josh.works/blog/october-2016-review">October review</a>) - I made progress on two of three projects, and one of those projects need to conclude to make space for the third. (I want to wrap up a course from <a href="http://www.climbersguide.co">www.climbersguide.co</a>, and once that hits a stable finish state, I'll switch to prep for Turing School.)</p><h2>Deepen my knowledge of front-end web development</h2><p>Same goal as last year - finish up the current tutorial, and then sketch out small next steps and start studying. <a target="_blank" href="http://exercism.io/">exercism.io</a>&nbsp;is a good place to work on little problems and practice a bit.</p><h2>Climb 5.13</h2><p>Last month I sent my first 5.12d outside. A few days later I sent my first 5.13a in the gym. I can do all the moves on another 5.13a, all but one move on a 13c, and almost all of them on a 13d. Due to the inflation of indoor grades compared with outdoor grades, I'm thinking the indoor 13d might be a real 5.13a in difficulty.</p><p>Basically, I'm breaking into solid indoor 5.13 territory, in part because I'm getting better at remembering my sequences.</p><p>I'm still trying to figure out what my weaknesses are, in order to train my weakness instead of my strength. I've historically enjoyed training contact strength, but I believe I'm a bit short on movement strength, and absolutely terrible with technique. So, I am trying to train my technique.</p><h2>Get "The Climber's Guide" rolling</h2><p>I'm building out an email drip campaign that concludes with a <em>hard sale </em>(after delivering amazingly valuable guides), pointing people to a sales page (er, I need to write that, too), for the course.</p><p>I've worked with some lead climbers in person, working through the basics of the program, and I've gotten great feedback. Things like " life changing" and "my climbing will not be the same".</p><p>I'm working on working with a larger group of people, and I'd like to get some video from them doing the exercises, so others can follow along on their own, but it's <em>really encouraging</em>, the kind of feedback I'm getting.</p><p>I'm gonna launch with just the course + video at $67, with perhaps a more expensive offer at ~$197 including lots of my dedicated time, 1:1. (I could see doing face-time sessions or something, while the climber/belayer are doing the exercises). That will be partially to take advantage of the price anchoring effect, partially because some people will know they want the high-touch version, and $200 is nothing in comparison to what they'll get in return.</p><h2>Misc</h2><p>Random self-reflections.</p><h3>Phone Usage</h3><p>I've disabled my Twitter account. I changed the password to a random string, and then <a href="http://lettertomyfutureself.net/">wrote an email to my future self</a>&nbsp;with the password enclosed. Delivery date is sometime in August 2017. I know I could force a password reset, but knowing the password is coming, and introducing friction to the system makes me pay way less attention to the app.</p><p>I deleted Instagram as well.</p><p>Both of these changes have helped me spend a LOT less time on my phone every day.</p>

(Moment for iPhone looks like a nice equivalent.)[/caption]


<h3>Reading</h3><p>I'm building in even more reading time to my schedule every day too. It's stupid, but I sorta-accidentally set a goal of reading 100 books this year.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27372191-josh-thompson">I'm at 62 books</a>&nbsp;and no where close to hitting the goal of 100, (I had a three-month period where I read very little, for some reason) but I think I'm aiming to clear 75 books by end-of-year. I read about 50 last year, and plan on reading many fewer next year.</p><p>My effort to read 100 has made me read books that I would otherwise not have read. If it's short, and I get 30% of the way through and decide I don't want to finish, instead of stopping reading it (like I would normally do) I sometimes find myself trying to finish it. This is a bad use of time, but... oh well.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Typing for Programmers</title>
      <link>/blog/typing-for-programmers</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you had to distill my ability to bring value to those around me, it would be "Josh types good".</p>
<p>I can press these magical little keys on this little metal box here, and make these words come out.</p>
<p>If you're reading these words, you don't care how these words actually <em>got on this page</em>. You don't care if I used speech-to-text, transcription, hunt-and-pecked, or if my keyboard layout is QWERTY, Dvorak , or Colemak.</p>
<p>All that matters is that I can express reasonable ideas reasonably well. (Or, as I prefer, <em>unreasonable</em> ideas, reasonably well.)</p>
<p>You, too, probably spend a bit of your time behind a keyboard.</p>
<p>I've already spent time trying to improve my typing speed. After <a href="https://josh.works/blog/2014/07/16/learn-to-type-again">ill-fated attempts at converting myself to using the Colemak keyboard layout</a>, but I gave up, except <a href="https://josh.works/blog/2014/07/16/stop-yelling-on-the-internet-or-a-better-use-for-the-caps-lock-key">I kept my CAPS LOCK key mapped to DELETE</a>.</p>
<p>That was a reasonable position to find myself, except now I'm getting into this whole "programming" thing. That means I have to familiarize myself with that part of my keyboard I've so far avoided.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>[] {} |\\| #{'word_that_means_something'} &amp;&amp; |other| arcane.keys.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don't forget your symbols! </p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>!@#$%&amp;* ()- _ =+&lt;&gt;) \\` ~\`.</code></pre></blockquote>
<p>I ultimately need to be able to use every single one of those keys without thinking about it, without looking at the keyboard, <em>and</em> without looking at what I'm typing to verify that it's correct.</p>
<p>(For example, if you're reading documentation or code on one part of your screen, typing something into some other program, you cannot be looking at what you're typing <em>and</em> what you're <em>supposed</em> to be typing simultaneously.)</p>
<h2 id="how-have-i-learned-to-type-all-these-crazy-symbols-">How have I learned to type all these crazy symbols?</h2>
<p>Two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Typing.io</li>
<li>Changed my passwords </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="typing-io">Typing.io</h3>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://typing.io/">typing.io</a> bills itself as "Typing Practice for Programmers"</li>
</ol>
<p>You can pick a language you want to learn (like Ruby, Python, C++, etc) and then presents you with real live code, that you type along with.</p>
<p>Typing.io doesn't solve everything, though, because there are still common code combinations that are hard to learn without lots of repetition.</p>
<p><em>a lesson from the Ruby track. Have you EVER used the <code>|</code> key? NO!</em></p>
<p>So, that brings us to method number 2:</p>
<h3 id="changed-my-passwords">Changed my passwords</h3>
<ol>
<li>Change commonly used passwords to require hard-to-type code snippets.</li>
</ol>
<p>I first got creative with changing my passwords after reading <a href="https://medium.com/@manicho/how-a-password-changed-my-life-7af5d5f28038#.c43eyodf2">How a Password Changed My Life</a>. I'd remind myself to get up early, (when that was hard, I reminded myself to <em>go to bed early</em>).</p>
<p>I cannot say that I've transformed my life through creative passwords, but I stumbled across using them to improve my typing. </p>
<p>I've got two passwords that I often type:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>My computer password, because I've got my computer set to sleep if there's no activity for five minutes (it requires a password upon waking up)</p>
</li>
<li><p>1Password Password Manager. Any time I want to log into a system that requires a password (so, about fifteen different systems during the normal workday), I have the password saved to 1Password, and if it has been inactive for five minutes, it locks itself.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>here I am using hard-to-remember keys, over and over and over</em></p>
<p>For both systems, I create unique passwords that require me to get good with different pieces of code.</p>
<p>In the past, I've used it to train the #, %, **, &amp;&amp; symbols, as well as [] and {}. I'm now comfortable with #{} and [&amp;&amp;]. Soon, I'll rotate them again to incorporate more "sticky" keys that I struggle with.</p>
<p>As I get deeper into my studies, anytime I encounter a difficult key combination (like hitting <code>=</code> right after my pinky is otherwise engaged with a <code>'</code> or <code>|</code> key) I jot it down, to use next time I update my passwords. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>November 2016 Review</title>
      <link>/blog/november-2016-review</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Note to the reader: The words that follow are all about me. This is naval-gaze-ish. I feel I owe you this warning.</em></p>
<p>My <a href="https://josh.works/blog/f23wrr3boior18oo14ih6v2lo0suz6">November goals</a> were an extension of October's goals. I feel comfortable with long-term unchanging goals.</p>
<p>They were:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Deepen my knowledge of front-end web development</li>
<li>Climb 5.13</li>
<li>Get "Climber's Guide" rolling.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>An attentive reader might notice that these goals violate all best practices for setting good goals. They're supposed to be "Specific, Measurable, Actionable/Attainable, Realistic, and Time-boxed"</p>
<p>My goals are none of these, but I've been able to break each goal down into smaller pieces. That's the sole way one could make progress.</p>
<p>My other mistake is that I have too many goals. Three goals is one more goal than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to soon clear item #3 from my plate, and focus on the complimentary goals of software development and climbing hard.</p>
<p>How am I doing, according to my own internal yardstick?</p>
<h2 id="front-end-web-development">Front-end web development</h2>
<p>I got the recommended pre-work from Turing School, where I'll be starting their seven-month development program in January. It replaced all other development goals, because reasons.</p>
<p>I've completed their "minimum recommended work", their "if you have time work", and am almost done with their "if you're feeling adventurous" recommended work. At that point I'll still have six weeks before classes start, so I'll consult with current students to see what they'd recommend I do next.</p>
<h2 id="climb-5-13">Climb 5.13</h2>
<p>This has been a bit more of an emotional trip than usual.</p>
<p>The sequence: Josh is at gym, close to sending climbs two-three grades harder than what he's used to.</p>
<p>Josh meets folks who are super cool, climb super hard, and want to do the same 5.13 at Clear Creek.</p>
<p>Josh &amp; co meet up the next day.</p>
<p>Josh warms up on the easiest line at the crag. Super casual climbing. Last three moves are a smidge hard. Josh is lazy, goes for a bad low hold instead of good higher hold.</p>
<p>Josh feels something go "pop" in his wrist.</p>
<p>Josh gets injured. :(</p>
<p>I strained something in my wrist. I was numb and/or tingly for five days, though my strength is returning. I didn't climb for almost two weeks, and am now easing back into climbing.</p>
<p>I've done v1-v3 bouldering circuits, and am easing back through v4 and v5. I got back on routes for the first time in a while this week, and have pushed back up into easy 5.12. I feel 70% recovered.</p>
<p>Now, though, I don't have a chance to send 5.13 this year, but if I keep recovering, I'll aim for January 2017.</p>
<h2 id="climber-s-guide">Climber's Guide</h2>
<p>Little happened here. I got excited with Turing prework.</p>
<h1 id="misc">Misc</h1>
<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<p>Still doing good. I'm at ~70 for the year, should cross the 75 book mark by end of December.</p>
<p>I just finished <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Disciplines-Execution-Achieving-Wildly-Important/dp/1491517751">The 4 Disciplines of Execution</a>, and want to apply some of those lessons to my own projects. </p>
<h3 id="phone-usage">Phone Usage</h3>
<p>Still low. (Which is good). I'm rolling Anki back into my life with gusto, which is pushing my usage back up, but memorization of programming bits of knowledge is fine with me. </p>
<p>I've written about using Anki for Spanish <a href="https://josh.works/blog/learning-spanish-conversation-connectors">here</a> and <a href="https://josh.works/blog/2-things-spanish">here</a>, but now I'm using it for programming. </p>
<p>I'll expand on that soon, but here's the best summary: <a href="https://sivers.org/srs">Derek Sivers on SRS for Programmers</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>December 2016 Goals</title>
      <link>/blog/december-2016-goals</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>December 19th seems a bit late to write about December's goals, huh?</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I've had some, and I will still have them through the end of the month.</p>
<p>I <em>did</em> post a review of November a few days ago. This should really be rolled into that. A "monthly review/going forward" evaluation makes way more sense than splitting it into two pieces.</p>
<p>See? There's value to these reviews. I'm streamlining my own workflow. :)</p>
<p>My goals for December are <em>mostly</em> an extension of my <a href="https://josh.works/blog/f23wrr3boior18oo14ih6v2lo0suz6">goals last month</a>. <a href="https://josh.works/blog/november-2016-review">November review here</a></p>
<ol>
<li>Deepen knowledge of front-end development*</li>
<li>Rehab my wrist effectively</li>
<li>Read seven more books (goal for the year is 80. It'll be a stretch...)</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="1-deepen-knowledge-of-front-end-development">1. Deepen Knowledge of front-end development</h1>
<p>* wrong terminology. I mean front-end because "back end" in my mind is WAAAY in the back-end, like you .NET and C++ guys doing things where you never touch an interface or create a button. I'll technically be a back-end developer by mid-2017, but I'll be comfortable in HTML/CSS/JS and all those traditional front-end parts of the internet.</p>
<p>Also, I've been working on general comfort around simple networking <em>and</em> my command line. I'm learning along through Vimtutor (open your terminal if you're on a Mac, type in "vimtutor" to see what it is.) Also, I'm writing this post using Vim. Admittedly, free-form typing in Vim is just the same as any other text editor, but moving around without the mouse and between modes takes some getting used to.</p>
<p>I've been inspired on Vim by <a href="http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/">OverTheWire.org</a>. Vim goes hand-in-hand with regular (or heavy) command line usage, and I want to get more fluid in the command line. I'm motivated by small, incremental challenges, so their "Bandit" wargame is perfect. I'm on <a href="http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit16.html">level 15</a> right now, to continue right after posting this. </p>
<p>I've gotten stuck twice, and you can google around to find good hints easily enough. Don't just blindly type in commands, though. Understand them.   </p>
<p>Oh, I finished up all the Turing school pre-work, and am taking a short spin through non-Ruby/Rails topics for fun. I'll dig back into building things shortly.</p>
<h1 id="2-rehab-my-wrist-safely-effectively">2. Rehab my wrist safely/effectively</h1>
<p>I injured my wrist five weeks ago. It was minor, but for a few days I was pretty out of commission on some key every-day-things. (Grinding coffee was a bit of a challenge.)</p>
<p>I've been able to climb again. For two weeks, I climbed exclusively easy problems, and over time am slowly stepping up the difficulty. I can climb hard-ish routes again without pain, but I don't feel safe trying hard or moving dynamically. But still, it feels good. I'm out of town through January 3rd, and have just my portable hangboard with me. So, I'll use that, and hopefully be 100% by the time I get back to Colorado.</p>
<h1 id="3-finish-seven-more-books-this-month">3. Finish seven more books this month</h1>
<p>I'm almost done with two books, and that will put me at 75 books for the year. I've got two or three more short-ish ones on deck (~150 pages) and if I can knock those out quickly, I'll be close to reading 80 books for the year. 80 is a nice, round number, so I'd like to do it.</p>
<p>Later this month I'll highlight the most dangerous books I've read in the last year. Could be interesting.</p>
<p>That's it. It's been odd writing this post in vim. So far, I don't really like the experience. I guess I feel more at home in Atom. Also, Atom has markdown specific syntax highlighting, spell check, and even checks for "weak" words (like "really"). I'll pop this text in there and do any last edits in Atom. Then it's off to the internet with these words.</p>

      <title>December Review, January Goals</title>
      <link>/blog/december-review-january-goals</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a follow-up from <a href="https://josh.works/blog/december-2016-goals">last month's goals</a></p>
<h2 id="1-deepen-knowledge-of-back-end-development">1. Deepen Knowledge of Back-end Development</h2>
<p>I finished OverTheWire's Bandit series, except <a href="http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit26.html">the last lesson</a>, which didn't make sense. (It does now! Turns out login shells and "regular" shells are different. I'll take another spin at it some day.) A few benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Way more comfortable in my terminal</li>
<li>Way better with Less/Vim/Man pages</li>
<li>Basic understanding of Linux boxes, SSHing, looking around an unfamiliar system for things of note.</li>
<li>Better understanding of how terminal programs and scripts work (.vimrc, .bashrc), how things relate to each other in the $PATH, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, before this, the following message wouldn't have meant much to me:</p>
<pre><code>The test files may have the execution bit set so you may also be able to run it like this:
    ./hello_world_test.rb</code></pre><p>now, without any hesitation, I know that <code>$ chmod u+x hamming_test.rb</code> fixes the problem, and I'm off to the races.</p>
<p>I worked through the <a href="https://launchschool.com/books/oo_ruby/read/the_object_model">LaunchSchool Ruby "book"</a>, and did lots of Anki memorization. I'm trying to absorb the basics of object oriented programing.</p>
<p>Now I'm on <a href="http://exercism.io/profiles/josh-works/6d8e0f83a1f048aeb99e46e6baf07ddf">Exercism</a>. I'm not sure how far through I'm going to go, but it's really useful on many levels. Interpreting error messages, getting tests to pass, test-driven development, etc. Reinforces what I've learned in the LaunchSchool material.</p>
<h2 id="2-rehab-my-wrist">2. Rehab my Wrist</h2>
<p>I climbed hard three times last week, for the first time in almost two months. My wrist is still certainly weak, but as long as I avoid certain grip positions, I feel good. So, I can start easing back into projects, as long as I listen to it.</p>
<p>I need to be better at climbing in a "defensive" manner anyway, if I plan on climbing in conjunction with difficult strength training, so this is fruitful experience, even though it's sometimes a bit frustrating.</p>
<h2 id="3-finish-seven-more-books">3. Finish seven more books</h2>
<p>Turns out I'd not counted my books that I've read this year correctly. I was aiming to get to 80 books (from 74 at the time) and once I updated my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/5318638">GoodReads profile</a>, I was at 81 or so. I've now read 84 books this year, and don't think I'll finish any of my current books today. (Dec. 31)</p>
<h1 id="january-goals">January Goals</h1>
<ul>
<li>Keep improving w/programming</li>
<li>Climb 5.13</li>
<li>Get a purchase page up, functioning for Climber's Guide</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="1-programming-improvement">1. Programming improvement</h2>
<p>Turing School starts Jan 23rd. I'm trying to pack in as much prep as I can before it starts. I'm working through some Exercism exercises, and trying to wrap my head around ruby basics, like manipulating/combining arrays and hashes, and understanding Enumerators.</p>
<p>I've been using <a href="https://ankiweb.net/about">Anki SRS</a> for a long time now, in a variety of ways in my life. Mostly <a href="https://josh.works/blog/2-things-spanish">vocabulary memorization</a>, but lots of other things too. Derek Sivers <a href="https://sivers.org/srs">uses it to improve as a programmer</a>.</p>
<p>If it's good enough for him, it's good enough for me!</p>
<p>Here's the thing, though - I don't yet have a good system for making cards. I can stick lots of information in the flashcards, but I'm not yet convinced that I've got the right method of quizzing myself with well-made cards.</p>
<p>Fortunately, my Anki deck is easy to experiment with and modify!</p>
<p>I plan on digging deeper in making programming-specific Anki flashcards later, but for now, the most useful Anki add-on is the <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/162313389">Power Format Pack</a>. It lets you apply markdown, including syntax-specific markdown, to your cards.</p>
<h2 id="2-climb-5-13">2. Climb 5.13</h2>
<p>I hopped on a project yesterday in Earth Treks Golden, and could do all of the hard moves without much wrist discomfort. It's certainly still weak, but it feels good to cause minor stress to it. I'm considering myself 90% healed. </p>
<p>The two themes of the next few months for me, as far as climbing progression, will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>remember my beta on routes</li>
<li>train max-weight hangs on an 18mm edge 2x/week. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-get-a-purchase-page-up-on-climber-s-guide">3. Get a purchase page up on Climber's Guide</h2>
<p>I've got tons of copy written, tons of ideas around this, I've worked out pricing, but some stupid fear keeps me from actually asking for money. I've been working regularly with a few folks in the gym that I've bumped into, and they've all seen massive improvement in their climbing. </p>
<p>The URL will probably be something like <a href="http://www.climbersguide.co/fear_course">http://www.climbersguide.co/fear_course</a> or something. We shall see!</p>
<p>I'll also record and post lots of video, talking through some of the finer points. Scary!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>2016 - Biggest Lesson, Most Dangerous Books</title>
      <link>/blog/2016-biggest-lesson-most-dangerous-books</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don't do New Years resolutions, but I like to think back on the last year.</p>
<p>I'll touch on two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The most important thing I've learned this year: Tactical Silence</li>
<li>Most dangerous books of 2016</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="tactical-silence">Tactical Silence</h1>
<p>I suspect that a year from now, I'm going to look back and say "Man, I really dropped the ball on a lot of conversations and relationships up through 2016".</p>
<p><em>Old Josh</em> thought discussions went somewhere, and that I could change minds with words, in conversations directly about the thing I wanted to change.</p>
<p>Hah. A helpful-but-reluctant read through <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1303.The_48_Laws_of_Power?ac=1&amp;from_search=true">48 Laws of Power</a>, couples with reading through <em>Life Together</em>, and a few other sources, convinced me that direct discussion about most things where I'm trying to convince someone of something is more "entertaining-though-possibly-damaging pastime" than "productive effort". This holds true in the work and private domains.</p>
<p><em>New Josh</em> is significantly more cynical, and in most situations much less inflamatory. I don't stand to gain anything from debates, and neither does the person I'm debating with. </p>
<p>What DOES matter is action. No one really cares what I <em>think</em> about anything, but as soon as I take <em>action</em> on something, any potential conversation is dramatically shifted.</p>
<p>Conversations go from hypothetical:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if x happens</p>
<p>If that thing is true, than it might mean this other thing is false!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to historical:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, you did X, and it seems like Y and Z happened, so I guess going forward we'll do...</p>
<p>I know I said X in the past, but it looks like we're seeing Y results, and IMPORTANT_PERSON suggests Z response.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, now, when someone says something that is (to me) catastrophically untrue, about either myself or anything else, I just smile and nod. Even if I need to do something about it, it's rare that addressing it right then will drive any useful change.</p>
<p>"Tactical Silence" is still new to me, so I imagine in another month I'll have much more coherent and consistent thoughts on it, but by then I'll probably not want to talk about it. </p>
<p>(I don't even know where the term came from. I feel better keeping my mouth shut when it's a <em>tactical</em> decision, instead of <em>backing down from conflict</em>)</p>
<h1 id="dangerous-books">Dangerous books</h1>
<p>I read a lot last year. More than I plan on reading for a while, and along the way, I read many books that I wouldn't really recommend to others, and a few that I would.</p>
<p>A <em>dangerous</em> book is one that did one of two two things, against my will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forced behavioral change in my daily or weekly routine</li>
<li>Forced my thinking to change on a specific topic or domain</li>
</ul>
<p>These books are dangerous because they're driving changes in how I behave and/or how I think. I am able to exert precious little control over both of these things, and am therefore exceedingly wary in letting outside influences in. So, when something <em>forces</em> me to behave or think differently, I must admit temporary defeat, even though I'm inevitably improved in the process.</p>
<p>I don't <em>endorse</em> any of these, though there's lots of potential value in all of them.</p>
<p>Here's the books that I label as <em>dangerous</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10266902-selfish-reasons-to-have-more-kids">Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/998062.The_Market_for_Liberty">The Market for Liberty</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work">Deep Work</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174845.Life_Together">Life Together</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33229792-80-000-hours">80,000 Hours</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>If your curiosity is even remotely piqued on any of these books, check out reviews on Amazon or GoodReads.</em></p>
<h3 id="selfish-reasons-to-have-more-kids">Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids</h3>
<p>This easily pushed me over the edge from "I don't look forward at all to the burdens of parenthood" to "it'll be hard, but I think the reward will fairly quickly outpace the effort, and the long-term gains certainly outweigh the short-term sacrifice."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Josh, that's a terrible reason to have kids. You think the long-term gains outweigh the short-term sacrifice? What about love, and your own flesh-and-blood? Doesn't that matter?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not to me, right now. I imagine it will eventually. Also, this is a small picture into my decision-making about many things. Imagine what it's like for Kristi, putting up with this all day long...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004OA64Q6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">Amazon: Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids</a></p>
<h3 id="the-market-for-liberty">The Market for Liberty</h3>
<p>Sigh. Here marks my transition "Libertarian" to "certified tin-foil-hat-wearing anarchist". I didn't even like the book, but there was one key point in the book that I couldn't shake.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A laissez-faire society is not a Utopia in which the initiation of violence is impossible. Rather, it is a society which does not <em>institutionalize</em> the initiation of force and in which there are means for dealing with aggression justly when it does occur.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, what system has a monopoly on the lawful initiation of force, and which also institutionalizes bad actors inside that system?</p>
<p>The government.</p>
<p>This ties into some other themes that have been growing in my head for a few years. Tinkering around the edges of a system that institutionalizes the initiation of force, and is able to coerce it's own survival on the backs of those who serve it... is a luxury, since it's steamrolling over the lives of many others.</p>
<p>Related: the last book that made me cry while reading it: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17834926-negroes-and-the-gun?ac=1&amp;from_search=true">Negroes and the Gun: The Black Tradition of Arms</a>. Spoiler: The government simultaneously claimed to act in the interests of it's citizens as it hunted down and destroyed innocent-but-marginalized people.</p>

<h3 id="deep-work">Deep Work</h3>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://josh.works/i-quit">I quit</a> after reading <em>Deep Work</em>. I started wearing a wrist-watch, and I now work in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoros</a>. As I track how much work I do, I mostly just track how many Pomororo's I've accomplished in a given day.</p>
<p>I'm still slowly remaking how I work and my daily routine in response to <em>Deep Work</em>.</p>
<p>No other book that I've read this year has impacted my day to day as <em>Deep Work</em> by Cal Newport.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted-ebook/dp/B00X47ZVXM/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1484174924&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=deep+work">Deep Work on Amazon</a></p>
<h3 id="life-together">Life Together</h3>
<p>Life Together is about Christians living in community. This exact topic has been plaguing me for the better part of two years, and <em>Life Together</em> brought a lot of hope and clarity to me.</p>
<p>I've struggled with the notion of "Christian community" because I get so frustrated by much of what happens in churches, or is done on my behalf by "the church" (as defined by old white conservatives from America).</p>
<p>I struggle to sit under the biblical authority of people who's politics seem decidedly anti-christ-like. The temptation is to just walk away and try to carve out some little "church of Thompson", and pretend like that is sufficient and Christ-honoring, but it isn't.</p>
<p><em>Life Together</em> was convicting, and is driving change in my daily routines. I'm going to re-read it soon and make another "wave" of changes, but the most encouraging thing was how much Bohhoeffer celebrates the virtue of keeping one's mouth shut:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bonhoeffer's Decisive Rule of Christian Fellowship: Every individual is prohibited from saying much of what occurs to him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, I can celebrate the minor victories of keeping my mouth shut, most of the time.</p>
<p>More on this topic another time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Life-Together-Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-ebook/dp/B005MJ2RPK/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1484175478&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=life+together">Amazon: Life Together</a></p>
<h3 id="80-000-hours">80,000 Hours</h3>
<p>40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year, 40 years. That's about 80,000 hours of work. How are you going to spend it?</p>
<p>This book <em>isn't</em> driving change in my life right now, but it meshes perfectly with my already-heretical notions about what it means to "do good work for others".</p>
<p>I.E. Do you want to have a big impact on the world? Don't become a doctor, at least if you plan on working in America. The marginal societal return of an additional doctor is tiny compared to that same doctor in a poor country, or compared to plenty of other career paths available to someone today.</p>
<p>Don't go work for a non-profit, either.</p>
<p>The theme is "effective altruism", and they handle job/career advice better than most. FWIW, they're big fans of Cal Newport's <em>Deep Work</em> philosophy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/80-000-Hours-fulfilling-career-ebook/dp/B01M70QISP/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1484175534&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=80000+hours">Amazon: 80,000 Hours</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Streets in Asheville</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="quick-and-dirty-street-analysis-in-asheville-nc">Quick-and-dirty street analysis in Asheville, NC</h2><p>A few months ago, I visited Asheville, NC. It's a nice town, and has a great pedestrian life, as far as I can tell.</p><p>As a thought experiment, I decided to see how well I could make the case for reducing the road width of a few streets.</p><p>The reasons are simple - wide roads are hard to cross by pedestrians, encourage faster driving, and are (as I'm going to try to prove) bad for cities.</p><p>It's common for "walkable" streets to have two wide lanes traffic (one each way) plus a lane for parking on each side, plus, perhaps, one or two bicycle lanes, and perhaps a small buffer between traffic going each way.</p><p>This <em>seems</em> like a tolerable idea, except it means all of a sudden your little road is difficult to cross.</p><p>I'll be examining <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/35.5965063,-82.5531438/35.5964338,-82.553156/@35.596531,-82.5533667,348m/data=!3m1!1e3">45-61 W Walnut St, Asheville, NC</a>:</p>

<p>There's a few lenses that you can evaluate these streets for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Car-friendly</li>
<li>Pedestrian-friendly/bike-friendly</li>
<li>Financial implications for city</li>
<li>Financial implications for businesses</li>
</ul>
<p>Lets take a quick stab at each of these:</p>
<h2 id="for-cars">For cars</h2>
<p>This street/road is very drivable. Here's the intersection looking north:</p>


       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="2500.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/589664cf15d5db588fef6a14/1486251224928//img.jpg" alt="green for cars, yellow for bikes"/> green for cars, yellow for bikes[/caption]


<p>The speed limit is, I believe, 20 MPH. It's on a similar looking street two blocks over.</p>
<p>Parking seems pretty easy, too. I'm going to make a case for eliminating the on-street parking, so here's all of the off-street parking available:</p>


       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="2500.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/589664e41b10e38edfe14657/1486251247603//img.jpg" alt="surface lots and parking garages within about two blocks"/> surface lots and parking garages within about two blocks[/caption]


<p>Each of those parking garages is six stories high.</p>
<p>Now, there is tons of space allocated on the street to parked cars, but that has two problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Periods of low-use times, the on-street parking generates no value to anyone, and encourages high speeds.</li>
<li>Periods of high-use times, the on-street parking is so scarce that no one can expect it to be available, and it encourages "browsing around" in your vehicle instead of heading for the closest dedicated parking area.<ul>
<li>Further, when the on-street parking is filled, it brings in almost no revenue to the city. It costs $2/hr to park, which is such a low amount it does not encourage people to be quick, or to use a more expensive parking structure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At almost 45 feet wide, this street takes quite a while to cross.</p>
<p>Since this is a walkable street with lots of shops, we would expect people to cross regularly.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.usroads.com/journals/p/rej/9710/re971001.htm">A slow-walking person (elderly person, child, or regular person with a stroller) would take 10 seconds to cross this entire street</a>.</p>
<p>The painful thing is, though, about half of the width of the street is low-value or wasted space.</p>
<p>There's a bike lane, which is required because the street traffic is expected to go much faster than bikes. At a twenty-mile-an-hour speed limit, this shows that the road is expected to primarily serve drivers passing through.</p>
<p>For cyclists, a reasonable average speed is 11 mph. If all drivers actually drive the posted speed limit, it would be pretty easy to share the road with someone traveling 11 mph on a bike. At 30 mph, though, it becomes dangerous for the cyclist to have to survive in the same space as a driver.</p>
<p>A bike lane solves the wrong problem, and in some cases makes it worse.</p>
<p>When the bike lane is not used, that unused space encourages drivers to speed up. Further, when the on-street parking is empty, it encourages drivers to go even faster, as the space dedicated to travel in both directions is extremely wide.</p>
<p>A speed limit sign is an inappropriate method to limit vehicle speeds. It treats the symptom, rather than the cause. Study after study has shown that traffic flows at safe speeds given road conditions. If traffic is "too fast", the road is too wide and too straight, or is too close to pedestrians that don't handle large chunks of metal flying around.</p>
<p>So, if you want people to go slower, reduce the space this vehicle has to drive.</p>
<h2 id="pedestrian-bike-friendly">Pedestrian/Bike friendly</h2>
<p>Pedestrians (or "people" as I'll refer to them for the rest of this post) have different interests than drivers.</p>
<p>People are best served by fractal and dense cityscapes. This means that in the course of walking a block, or a quarter mile, a person will encounter a range of services and shops. If a person has to walk 200 yards between points of interest, they're going to visit those places less, and they are more likely to visit that place in a car.</p>
<p>A 45 foot wide road is not pedestrian-friendly. Traffic moves quickly, and if you want to cross the street you have to either stand between parked cars as you wait for a break in traffic, or you have to travel to a crosswalk, which is a hassle.</p>

<h2 id="city-friendly">City-friendly</h2>
<p>A city (government) wants things that make itself money while also keeping it's constituents peaceful. I suspect that the most persuasive case that could be made to a city planner is "plan A, for which I advocate, will result in a larger addition to the tax base than plan B, which I oppose."</p>
<p>All else being equal, the more profitable option will win. Nothing else is equal, of course, and there are many influences advocating for different plans.</p>
<p>Most money for infrastructure comes from the federal government, so the easiest way to bring $10mm in to your city is to sign up for a big project and fund 20% of the project. The federal/state government will provide the other 80%.</p>
<p>This dynamic is dangerous and perverse. That's how you get city governments spending money they don't have to build infrastructure they don't need, without having a tax base to support the ongoing maintenance of this infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id="business-friendly">Business friendly</h2>
<p>If you're building new construction (or considering buying a parcel of land), you need to consider how people are going to visit your business. Will you get foot traffic, or vehicle traffic?</p>
<p>If you are going to get foot traffic, will there be foot traffic?</p>
<p>If you're aiming for vehicle traffic, do you need an on-site parking lot, or is there suitable parking near enough to your store that you can avoid building a parking lot?</p>
<p>If I had a store on Walnut or Lexington Ave in Asheville, I'd expect walk-in traffic, and I would NOT plan on building a parking lot. Look at the available off-street parking in the area. There's plenty available. Furthermore, I would want to maximize the space available to me to generate revenue.</p>
<p>If I had a restaurant, I'd want space for tables. If I had a store, I'd want the biggest retail area. If I were building things, I'd want as much space for my workshop + display area.</p>
<p>All of these desires would result in my maximizing the footprint of usable space to me.</p>
<p>A parking lot flies in the face of this need.</p>
<p>Here's a better treatment of why small, dense lots will always be healthier and out-perform auto-oriented businesses: <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2017/1/29/the-cost-of-auto-orientation-rerun">The Cost of Auto Orientation</a></p>
<h2 id="why-this-matters-to-me">Why this matters to me</h2>
<p>I've been noodling on this idea for a while. A while back I read <a href="https://likewise.am/2016/05/08/why-suburbia-sucks/">Why Suburbia Sucks</a>, and about that time I stumbled across <a href="www.strongtowns.org">StrongTowns</a>. My wife and I spent about six months outside the USA, across the Americas and Europe, and I got to thinking why almost every environment I've ever lived in has been universally distasteful to me.</p>
<p>Turns out that cities oriented for cars and not people are not pleasant places to live.</p>
<p>I want to live in a place that is pleasing to me, and I believe cities and towns can create environments that are not hostile to this act of creation. And, of course, as one block fills with a dense and fractal mix of uses, the next one over will do the same. Ironically, <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2016/8/11/reclaiming-redneck-urbanism-what-urban-planners-can-learn-from-trailer-parks">the general vibe of trailer parks has immense appeal to me</a>. Most of us raise our nose at trailer parks, and go about making it even more difficult for this kind of dense urbanism to be built.</p>
<p>I'm priced out of every market I would want to live in right now. This is because of bad policy, not supply and demand. <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2016/9/22/the-50000-san-francisco-studio-apartment">Here's how to build and buy a $50k property in San Francisco</a></p>
<p>I feel like the thing that I want doesn't exist in most of America, and I want it to. Further, I believe small, dense, self-sufficient urban areas can be financially self-sufficient, which will matter if the massive stream of money from the federal government ever slows down.</p>
<p>Even more tactically, I really like Golden. But it's succumbing to the same influences the rest of American towns are. I want to push back against that negative influence here, so that Golden can become an affordable place for normal people. (It's not affordable to purchase property in Golden right now.)</p>
<p>Here's some of the parking madness that is in Golden right now:</p>

<p>Phew. That was a brain dump. I write to help organize my own thinking, and this has moved me in that direction, despite how disorganized all the proceeding words were.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Playing with the HTTP send/response cycle in Ruby, without Faraday</title>
      <link>/blog/playing-with-the-http-sendresponse-cycle-in-ruby</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>author's note (that's me): I've written a lot over the last few months of Turing, but my <a href="https://gist.github.com/josh-works">list of public gists</a> is getting so long I can barely keep track of it. So, as I write longer things that I think might be useful to others (especially Turing students) I'm going to stick it here. If you're not interested in Turing or programming, it's safe to skip this particular post</em></p>
<p><em>Also, I wrote this originally in github-flavored markdown. Seems to play poorly with this Markdown editor. Some syntax highlighting may be off, but the code itself isn't that important. Playing with Curl and NetCat in the terminal is where all the fun happened. Apologies for readability challenges. <a href="https://gist.github.com/josh-works/e02242b959f0422077c801cef02ab838">Here's the original on github</a></em></p>
<p>The following is part of the <a href="http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me">HTTP Server</a> project.</p>
<p>First, I'm working through <a href="http://practicingruby.com/articles/implementing-an-http-file-server">Practicing Ruby's "Implementing an HTTP File Server"</a> for general practice and understanding.</p>
<p>I'm going to use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en">Postman</a> to capture traffic and try to replicate some of the things the guides reference.</p>
<p><strong>Lastly, I just found Jeff Casamir's walkthrough of almost everything I've discovered in the last week. Save yourself the time, and go read <a href="https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me-addendum.markdown">it here</a></strong></p>
<h2 id="finding-get-requests-responses-in-the-wild">Finding GET requests/responses in the wild</h2>
<p>First, I need to configure postman to show request/response headers, like what the guides indicate:</p>
<pre><code># HTTP Request
GET /file.txt HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: ExampleBrowser/1.0
Host: example.com
Accept: */*

# HTTP Response
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 13
Connection: close

hello world</code></pre><p>Turns out Postman cannot do this caputuring by default. </p>
<p>So, follow <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33793629/postman-how-to-see-request-with-headers-and-body-data-with-variables-substitut">these instructions</a> (to enable <code>right_click &gt; inspect</code> within Postman</p>
<p>Lets first look at some get requests in the wild:</p>
<p>Using Postman, I made a get request for <code>turing.io</code>. I get back lots of HTML, etc. But I want to see the headers. The "Headers" tab in the Postman request isn't really helpful.</p>


      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/58e71e5b725e255284d9729c/1491541612037//img.jpg" alt=""/>


<p>So, we'll look at "network traffic" per the following:</p>
<p>right click inside postman &gt; "inspect" &gt; Network tab &gt; "clear" the screen, if anything is in it, &gt; switch back to postman, re-send the GET request &gt; switch back to "inspect window".</p>
<p>Looks like this:</p>


      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/58e71ec81b631b9312d85a73/1491541748713//img.gif" alt=""/>


<p>OK, cool. This stuff looks promising: </p>

      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/58e71f2420099ea651601e3e/1491541800899//img.jpg" alt=""/>


<p>Everything I highlighted corresponds to items mentioned in the instructions. This is approaching "interesting", and I feel like there might be an insight around the corner. </p>
<h2 id="setting-up-my-own-requests-in-ruby-seeing-headers-in-postman">Setting up my own requests in Ruby, seeing headers in Postman</h2>
<p>So, I can find the headers for any GET request I might make in the wild, so now I'm going to try to do the same setup with my own little ruby server, per <a href="http://practicingruby.com/articles/implementing-an-http-file-server">this guide</a>.</p>
<p>I'm following the author's instructions to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To begin, let’s build the simplest thing that could possibly work: a web server that always responds “Hello World” with HTTP 200 to any request</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm writing everything in the http_yeah_you_know_me directory. I'll delete it before pushing a final project version to Github. </p>
<pre><code>require 'socket'

server = TCPServer.new('localhost', 2345)</code></pre><p>Turns out TCPServer is a <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/socket/rdoc/TCPServer.html">Ruby class</a>, just like an enumerable or array or hash or Fixnum or NilClass, etc. Cool.</p>
<p>It's got some methods that I won't worry about right now.</p>
<p>Moving on:</p>
<pre><code>loop do
  socket = server.accept
  request = socket.gets

  STDERR.puts request

  response = "Hello World!\n"

  socket.print "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n" +
               "Content-Type: text/plain\r\n" +
               "Content-Length: #{response.bytesize}\r\n" +
               "Connection: close\r\n"</code></pre><p>The loop seems interesting. I tested the simple_server.rb file before writing this, and it seemed that the socket closed as soon as a single request was made. (I.E. I'd start the "server", and as soon as I interacted with it in any way, it would do something and close. So I wonder if this loop will keep the server open. </p>
<p>Please read through the commented version of what I'm writing above. It's a good explenation, but I've noticed something interesting. We're printing a HTTP Response. See the <code>HTTP/1.1 200OK</code> in the first line? Does that look familiar?</p>
<p><img src="https://cl.ly/3k3U291S0A3O/Developer_Tools_-_chrome-extension___fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop_html_requester_html.jpg" alt="looks like we're writing some of this header"></p>
<pre><code>socket.print "\r\n"
  socket.print response
  socket.close
end</code></pre><p>That first line is, according to the comments, the required new-line to tell the server (or something) that the header is over and the body content is coming. The response references a previously defined variable of <code>response = "Hello World!\n"</code>, so we're printing <code>hello world</code> as the content. </p>
<p>Lets try to fire this thing up. Save file, run as a program from the command line, and visit <code>http://localhost:2345/anything</code>. </p>
<p>Looks like it worked:</p>
<p><img src="https://cl.ly/1s2Y2X053e3y/localhost_2345_anything.jpg" alt="printed to the browser"></p>
<p>But it's not very exciting. Lets get back into Postman and try to dig deeper:</p>
<p>Now we're getting more. I can see every parameter passed through to the server, <em>and it is staying open</em>! (Put a flag in that. The "simple server" we made for HTTP_yeah_you_know_me can be kept open with a loop. Cool.</p>


      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/58e71fc5725e255284d9c329/1491542006921//img.gif" alt=""/>


<p>And, as the author mentioned in the tutorial, this seems to be working:</p><pre><code># Log the request to the console for debugging
  STDERR.puts request</code></pre><p><img src="https://cl.ly/1c3d1V1Q0i2Q/1____turing_module1_projects_http_yeah_you_know_me_experiments__ruby_.jpg" alt="STDERR printed to screen. I bet this is useful for later"></p><p>And, as recommended, open up another window and run <code>curl --verbose -XGET http://localhost:2345/anything_you_want_to_put_here</code></p><p>I like to understand shell commands when I run them, so if you look at the MAN pages for <code>curl</code>, you can find what each of those flags means.</p><p><code>curl --verbose</code> means "curl talks a lot", and more importantly, lines beginning with <code>&gt;</code> is <em>header data sent by curl</em>, and lines beginning with <code>&lt;</code> data-preserve-html-node="true" data-preserve-html-node="true" data-preserve-html-node="true" data-preserve-html-node="true" data-preserve-html-node="true" is <em>header data received by curl</em>. Lines beginning with <code>*</code> is additional info added by CURL.</p><p>I suspect this will be important.</p><p><code>-XGET</code> is a flag that, according to the MAN page, "specifies custom request method". the <code>-X</code> lives by itself, and whatever follows is what it makes as the request method, so <code>-XGET</code>, <code>-XPOST</code>, and <code>-XDELETE</code> are all probably valid uses of the flag.</p><p>Here's the output for <code>curl --verbose -XGET htpp://localhost:23454/whatever_blah_blah_blah</code></p><pre><code>[experiments (setup)]$ curl --verbose -XGET http://localhost:2345/whatever_blah_blah_blah
Note: Unnecessary use of -X or --request, GET is already inferred.
*   Trying ::1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to localhost (::1) port 2345 (#0)
&gt; GET /whatever_blah_blah_blah HTTP/1.1
&gt; Host: localhost:2345
&gt; User-Agent: curl/7.52.1
&gt; Accept: */*
&gt;
&lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK
&lt; Content-Type: text/plain
&lt; Content-Length: 13
&lt; Connection: close
&lt;
Hello World!
* Curl_http_done: called premature == 0
* Closing connection 0</code></pre><p>Cool. We've got data sent by curl (prepended with <code>&gt;</code>), data received (prepended with <code>&lt;</code>), data-preserve-html-node="true" data-preserve-html-node="true" data-preserve-html-node="true" data-preserve-html-node="true" data-preserve-html-node="true" what is actually passed through (the one line without any characters at the beginning) and of course, additional data returned by CURL. (begins with <code>*</code>).</p><p>Phew. Learning some stuff, eh? I still don't know what most of this means, but it's building out a mental model. So, keep experimenting. You're typing all these commands yourself, right? no copy-pasta from here. That'll keep you from learning as much.</p><h2 id="congrats-">Congrats!</h2><p>This is the end of the first section of the post, building a simple server. Now, moving along, gonna build a more complex one. </p><p>This is where I look over my notes, take a walk, and get some coffee. This is a lot of work, so let it sink in and consolidate. </p><h1 id="serving-files-over-http">Serving files over HTTP</h1><p>I'm now working through the second half of <a href="http://practicingruby.com/articles/implementing-an-http-file-server">this tutorial</a>.</p><p>He says:</p><blockquote>
<p>For each incoming request, we’ll parse the <code>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Request-URI</code>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; header and translate it into a path to a file within the server’s public folder.</p>
</blockquote><p>What's the request URI? How's it different from a URL? I'm not sure, but I can infer some things. Mostly, looking at some of the results of poking around in different pages in Postman, and looking at the results, I think we can figure this out. (Googling around for "URI vs URL didn't help a lot)</p><p>We know that the first line of a HTTP Request looks like this: <code>GET / HTTP/1.1</code>. This is three things:</p><ol>
<li>GET is the method.</li>
<li>/ is the "path"</li>
<li>HTTP/1.1 is the protocal (or possibly called the "scheme").</li>
</ol><p>So, if I go to the root of a website (like www.turing.io) the header will be: <code>GET / HTTP/1.1</code>. </p><p>If I go to a specific page (or <em>resource</em>) I'll go to www.turing.io/our-team. What do you think the GET request would look like then? Here's my guess:</p><p><code>GET /our-team HTTP/1.1</code></p><p>Lets fire it up in POSTMAN and see:</p><p><img src="https://cl.ly/2s3P2z1e0J40/Developer_Tools_-_chrome-extension___fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop_html_requester_html.jpg" alt="looks promising"></p><p>Cool. So the path is just <code>website.com/&lt;the_path&gt;</code>. Or, to tie it into ruby-speak, when we <code>require</code> another file, we define its from the root directory. Similar idea with the URI.</p><p>Onward.</p><p>First bit of code in the second file. (I'd start a new file from scratch, and type every line...)</p><pre><code>require 'socket'
require 'uri'

WEB_ROOT = './public'

CONTENT_TYPE_MAPPING = {
  'html' =&gt; 'text/html',
  'txt' =&gt; 'text/plain',
  'png' =&gt; 'image/png',
  'jpg' =&gt; 'image/jpeg'
}

DEFAULT_CONTENT_TYPE = 'application/octet-stream'</code></pre><p>Makes sense, except I have no idea what an <code>octet-stream</code> is. Don't really care, though. This just is mapping input values to something that our HTTP server can understand, I believe.</p><pre><code>def content_type(path)
  ext = File.extname(path).split(".").last
  CONTENT_TYPE_MAPPING.fetch(ext, DEFAULT_CONTENT_TYPE)
end</code></pre><p>We've seen <code>File.extname</code> before, when doing FileIO stuff. So this is taking the file extension, splitting it from the file name, and trying to match it to the hash we just wrote. If it matches, it'll pull and do something with the matching value. I.E. <code>jpg</code> =&gt; <code>image/jpeg</code>. </p><p>Onward, a bunch of other stuff that is explained in the commented out portions of the tutorial, and I barely understand it, so skipping them.</p><p>We see this again:</p><p>(You typed it out by hand, right?)</p><pre><code>loop do

  socket = server.accept
  request_line = socket.gets

  STDERR.puts request_line

  path = requested_file(request_line)

  if File.exist?(path) &amp;&amp; !File.directory?(path)
    File.open(path, "rb") do |file|
      socket.print "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n" +
                  "Content-Type: #{content_type(file)}\r\n" +
                  "Content-Length: #{file.size}\r\n" +
                  "Connection: close\r\n"

      socket.print "\r\n"

      IO.copy_stream(file, socket)
    end

  else
    message = "File not found\n"

    socket.print "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\r\n" +
                "Content-Type: text/plain\r\n" +
                "Content-Length: #{message.size}\r\n" +
                "Connection: close\r\n"

    socket.print "\r\n"

    socket.print message
  end</code></pre><p>I was curious about all the <code>\r\n</code> characters. It's obviously something to do with a line break. </p><p>On <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4415654/which-line-break-in-php-mail-header-r-n-or-n">stack overflow</a>, I found this:</p><blockquote>
<p>The CRLF <code>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \r\n</code>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; , should be used according to the php documentation. Also, to conform to the RFC 2822 spec lines must be delimited by the carriage return character, CR <code>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \r</code>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; immediately followed by the line feed, LF <code>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n</code>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; .</p>
</blockquote><p>Seems like it's a <em>Carriage Return Line Feed</em> symbol, native to PHP, that inserts a really "hard" line break. That makes since, since earlier in the guide, the author mentioned that HTTP request/responses are very sensitive to line breaks and white spaces. So, I'm flagging this as "important" for later use.</p><p>And, keep following the instructions. I got it to serve up an /index.html page by default, and downloaded a few other files that I "stored" in a public directory in the same place as the server-generation script. </p><p>So, I feel like I've got my head a little more wrapped around server stuff in Ruby. Writing it out helps me a bit, maybe will be helpful to others, too.</p><h1 id="play-around-with-building-your-own-http-response-live-">Play around with building your own HTTP Response - LIVE!</h1><p>I'm keeping notes for myself and my own understanding - I'm not good at teaching that which I barely can wrap my head around, so... I apologize for the upcoming disconnectedness or holes in reasoning.</p><p>I've really, realy wanted to get a tool up and running that lets me talk, as a server, to something that's expecting a given response. This is so I can get one level of abstraction lower to understand these HTTP requests/responses.</p><p>I just figured out how to do it.</p><p>We'll use two tools, both already existing in your terminal:</p><ol>
<li>nc (Stands for "Net Cat")</li>
<li>CURL (stands for C-URL? "see URL"?)</li>
</ol><p>I strongly recommend downloading and installing <a href="https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr">tldr</a>, as it will let you more quickly explore terminal commands. We'll be using "flags" for both the above utilities. (a flag makes a program do something other than it's default. Like <code>ls</code> vs <code>ls -l</code>)</p><p>You'll need two terminal windows side by side, like this:</p><p><img src="https://cl.ly/0Y0K180V0Q3q/1____turing_module1_projects_http_yeah_you_know_me__nc_.jpg" alt="side by side"></p><p>On the left is netcat, on the right is CURL.</p><p>I started the <code>nc</code> command on the left with <code>nc -l 9090</code>. If you're reading this, please, please install the <code>tldr</code> tool and run (in your terminal) <code>tldr nc</code>.</p><p>Now, look up what <code>-l</code> does. </p><p>On the right, I've got CURL, running as <code>curl -v localhost:9090</code>. Look it up in TLDR, tell me what -v does. (Hint, i've outlines it above.)</p><p>Here's using them in tandem: </p>

      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/58e7206f9de4bb42e72e3e5b/1491542143058//img.gif" alt=""/>


<p>You can write, line by line, your own valid header. You'll notice it ends whenever you add a new-line character, and when you DO try to send actual content, if you get the "content-length" figure wrong, it'll cut you off.</p><p>example: </p>

      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/58e7209e59cc682cc93f0068/1491542210292//img.gif" alt=""/>


<h1 id="i-want-to-talk-to-my-ruby-program-now">I want to talk to my ruby program now</h1><p>I feel lik I can use Netcat to impersonate a client (or server? still not sure) and talk to my ruby program (which is operating as a server...) So... lets do that.</p><p>Here's the ruby I'm running:</p><pre><code>require 'pry'
require 'socket'

class HTTP
  attr_reader :server

  def initialize
    @server = TCPServer.new(9090)
  end

  puts "server's up, capiTAN"

  def receive_request_send_response
    while client = server.accept
      whole_response = []
      while line = client.gets and !line.chomp.empty?
        whole_response &lt;&lt; line
      end
      whole_response
    end

    output = "&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;holy what the fuck&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"

  end
end

p server = HTTP.new
p server.server
p server.receive_request_send_response</code></pre><p>When I run the ruby program, it just hangs. Which means it's stuck in <code>while client = server.accept</code>. When I run <code>curl -v localhost:9090</code> it too just sits and waits. Everyone is waiting for a response, but not even a header is sent, else <code>curl</code> would have shown </p><pre><code>&gt; header data
&gt; sent by
&gt; curl</code></pre><p>So, CURL doesn't have anything to send to. I wonder why.</p><p><code>nc</code> has an option. Checking out <code>tldr nc</code> the first option says:</p><blockquote>
<p>Connect to a certain port (you can then write to this port): nc ip_address port</p>
</blockquote><p>Good enough for me. </p><p><code>nc localhost 9090</code> doesn't do anything in either the ruby program or NC.</p><p>Lets try submitting a well-formatted HTTP request, and see what happens</p><p>I tried typing in exactly what CURL had sent last time:</p><pre><code>&gt; GET / HTTP/1.1
&gt; Host: localhost:9090
&gt; User-Agent: curl/7.52.1
&gt; Accept: */*</code></pre><p>and got nothing. but that's OK, cuz my program (right now) isn't showing me the captured HTTP request. Lets modify it to do that.</p><p>... </p><p>...</p><p>still trying to get this to work. Rolling back to a "known good" state w/my ruby program that captures server data.</p><p>Oh, worth noting:</p><p>if you see something that has this:</p><pre><code>GET / HTTP/1.1</code></pre><p>What is it? A request or a response?</p><p>How about this:</p><pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK</code></pre><p>The first one is a <em>request</em>, the latter a <em>response</em>. I'm starting to not confuse them. </p><p>Boom, did it. First, I rolled back to the "server" we wrote as part of the tutorial I linked above.</p><pre><code>require 'socket'

<li>Build variables that hold the variable parts of the response. (seems obvious, right? That's why I wanna smash through my desk with my head.)</li>
</ol><p>I'll add comments to the following code. This mostly handles iteration 2:</p><pre><code>def send_message

      elsif path == "/datetime"
        response = datetime_path
      elsif path == "/shutdown"
        response = shutdown_path
      end

      # building the server response. It'll always get wrapped the the following HTML. the `join` method fixes the fact that the parameters are currently wrapped in brackets. example: hello_path = ["some string here"])
      output = "&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;#{response.join}&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"

      # this is the fixed part of the server response. Every response will be the same, except the date changes to be Time.now, and output.length MUST be accurate, or the server will either not print the full request, or it'll hang after all the data is received, because it's expecting more.

      # incrementing my counter
      @counter += 1

      # client.puts is the _sending_ actual response to the server. Headers is distinct from the output.
      client.puts headers
      client.puts output

      # this stuff is sorta ugly random shit to reset the values so when I reload the page, it'll accept different paths. I am 100% sure this is not best practice.
      client.close

      # I couldn't get my shutdown method to sit neatly in one if statement. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
      client.exit if path == "/shutdown"
      # resetting values for next connection

      <title>Tour of D3 for Clueless Folk Like Me</title>
      <link>/blog/tour-of-d3</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>D3 stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D3.js">Data Driven Documents</a>, and it's the coolest thing ever.</p>
<p>Check out a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.jasondavies.com/animated-bezier/">Animated, interactive curves</a>(dynamic)</li>
<li><a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/9539958">OMG Particles II</a>(dynamic)</li>
<li><a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/885fffe88d72b2a25c090e0bbbef382f">simple map of the us</a>(static) &lt;= data-preserve-html-node="true" very little code</li>
<li><a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4739610f6d96aaad2fb1e78a72b385ab">Radial Dendrogram</a>(static)</li>
<li><a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/2d466ec3417722e3568cd83fc35338e3">circle wave</a>(dynamic)</li>
<li><a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/95aa92e2f4e8345aaa55a4a94d41ce37">Force-directed tree</a>(dynamic) &lt;= data-preserve-html-node="true" super cool</li>
</ul>
<p>So, this is the kind of stuff you can do with D3. The Front-end track at Turing gave a short lesson on D3, and I was one of two back-end folks participating. This was actually really encouraging, because they didn't know much about d3 either. </p>
<p>So, lets dig into D3 a bit, and do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get a running d3 map running locally (we're gonna use <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/2d466ec3417722e3568cd83fc35338e3">circle wave</a>)</li>
<li>Deconstruct a simple d3 project to it's minimum components, expecting that we'll learn something along the way.</li>
</ol>
<p>_Note to the reader: I know <em>almost nothing</em> about frontend tools. If you're comfortable on the front-end, bear with my ignorance. If you, too, know nothing about the front-end, great! This should be at your level._</p>
<h1 id="running-circle-wave-locally">Running circle-wave locally</h1>
<ul>
<li>you'll need a text editor and a browser. I'm using Chrome and Atom.</li>
<li>you'll need to be able to open up various files on your computer in Chrome and your text editor. My tool of choice is the command line + iterm + zsh. </li>
</ul>
<p>First, have a folder you can stick this all in. I've got <code>/d3/circle-wave/</code></p>
<p>Next, open up the <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/2d466ec3417722e3568cd83fc35338e3">circle wave project</a>. </p>
<p>See where it says "index.html" on the page, followed by the code?</p>
<p>Copy and paste all that into <code>index.html</code>. </p>
<p>Save the file, and open it in chrome. <code>open -a "Google Chrome" index.html</code> or <code>open index.html</code>, run from the folder holding the file, should get it opened up for you. If it's opening it in finder or something, google around to figure out what works for you.</p>
<p>At this point, you <em>should</em> have opened up the file on your machine. You'll know this because the URL is something like <code>file:///Users/joshthompson/turing/2mod/self_study/d3/circle_wave/index.html</code>, and you should see the circle-wave animation running.</p>
<h2 id="breaking-things">Breaking things</h2>
<p>Lets deconstruct what's going on a bit. Open up Chrome's Dev Tools (cmd+shift+i) and look at the code. Tab over to <code>elements</code>, and it should look pretty simple, pretty static.</p>
<p>Next, lets <em>inspect</em> just the circle wave itself. Open up the "selection tool" (it's the mouse icon in a box on the top left side of your dev-tools toolbar. The shortcut is <code>cmd+shft+c</code> and mouseover <em>just</em> the circle itself. </p>
<p>Now it's a bit strange. You should get a slowly-moving box with rapidly-changing x/y values:</p>
<p><img src="https://cl.ly/3t2B3j0E450X/Screen%20Recording%202017-04-01%20at%2003.17%20PM.gif" alt="box doing stuff"></p>
<p>When you click on it, you'll see the values in your HTML going bananas: </p>
<p><img src="https://cl.ly/0m1p151z0u0p/index_html.png" alt="crazy scrolling values"></p>
<p>it looks like all that is happening inside of the <code>&lt;path stroke="cyna" style="mix-blend-mode: darken;" d= {crazy values here}</code></p>
<p>Lets play with these values for a bit. In the browser, double-click on the "cyan" element. (you might not be seeing cyan, but have a different color. it depends on which line you managed to click on above.) </p>
<p>Change it to red, or green, or whatever. When I changed it (a few times) at one point the element got centered way away from everything else, and looked super crazy.</p>
<p><img src="https://cl.ly/162A1j3O3d0O/index_html.png" alt="broke this line's centering"></p>
<h2 id="d3-docs-console-changing-values">D3 Docs, console, changing values</h2>
<p>Looking through the code, there's a few things that jump out at me:</p>
<p>&lt;?prettify? data-preserve-html-node="true"&gt;</p>
<pre data-preserve-html-node="true" class="prettyprint">  var t = d3.now() / 1000;
</pre>

<p>What's the <code>.now</code> method on d3? The <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-timer/blob/master/README.md#now">docs</a> say it just picks the current time value, sorta like <code>Time.now</code> in Ruby. </p>
<p>Popping into the dev tools console, lets try <code>d3.now()</code>. </p>
<p>Ah, interesting. values. And in the code, it's calling <code>d3.now() / 1000;</code></p>
<p>Looks like that returns a random number between (maybe) 1..100, with many decimal points. </p>
<p>I'm gonna try "hardcoding" the <code>t</code> value in the code I've copied into Atom.</p>
<p>When I changed</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">var t = d3.now() / 1000;</code></pre>
<p>to </p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">var t = 44.328915;</code></pre>
<p>the animation is frozen. It just starts and doesn't move. So I think d3.now is pulling an <em>always new</em> value for time. This must be what makes the circle move at a consistent pace. (Or I'm totally wrong. who knows)</p>
<p>That makes sense, though. Here's where that time variable is being used:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">.radius(function(a) {
   var t = d3.now() / 1000;
   return 200 + Math.cos(a * 8 - i * 2 * Math.PI / 3 + t) * Math.pow((1 + Math.cos(a - t)) / 2, 3) * 32;
   });</code></pre>
<p>So <code>t</code> is talking to both <code>cos</code> functions. </p>
<p>Digging into that <code>cos</code> function, I looked in the D3 docs, and it doesn't have a Math module. Turns out that's just JavaScript. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/cos">JavaScript's Math.cos()</a> for the curious. </p>
<h2 id="d3-curvelinearclosed">d3.curveLinearClosed</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-js">return d3.radialLine()
    .curve(d3.curveLinearClosed)
    .angle(function(a) { return a; })
    .radius(function(a) {
      var t = d3.now() / 1000;
      return 200 + Math.cos(a * 8 - i * 2 * Math.PI / 3 + t) * Math.pow((1 + Math.cos(a - t)) / 2, 3) * 32;
    });</code></pre>
<p>That <code>curveLinearClosed</code> is interesting. D3's docs indicate that <code>curveLinear</code> is also a valid option. Lets try it out.</p>
<p><img src="https://cl.ly/2S153W1b1N36/index_html.png" alt="non-connected lines"></p>
<p>Makes sense. The <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#curveLinear">docs</a> say the difference between curveLinear and curveLinearClosed is if there's a line drawn between the first and last element in the line. </p>
<p>the first var block looks interesting:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">var svg = d3.select("svg"),
    width = +svg.attr("width"),
    height = +svg.attr("height"),
    angles = d3.range(0, 2 * Math.PI, Math.PI / 200);</code></pre>
<p>I'm curious about that <code>angles</code> value. d3.range(something complicated) gives... what exactly?</p>
<p>Over to the console:</p>
<pre><code>d3.range(0, 2 * Math.PI, Math.PI / 200);
=&gt; Array[400]</code></pre><p>Well, what's in the array?</p>
<pre><code>x.forEach(
    console.log)</code></pre><p>(pardon my bad JavaScript syntax. I've not done much with it before today...)</p>
<p>And that printed a <em>ton</em> of stuff to the console. </p>
<p>Turns out theres a better way to see what's in an array. Just click the arrow next to it, and you can open it up.</p>
<p>So, looks like this array is composed of four ranges: <code>[0...99],[100...199],[200...299],[300...399]</code>. Each of those has a bunch more values inside, like:</p>
<pre><code>1: 0.015707963267948967
2: 0.031415926535897934
3: 0.0471238898038469
4: 0.06283185307179587
5: 0.07853981633974483
6: 0.0942477796076938
7: 0.10995574287564278
8: 0.12566370614359174</code></pre><p>Crazy. There's some mad mathing going on in here.</p>
<p>OK, in <code>svg.append("g")</code>, that's how D3 talks to (or about) SVGs. it's "Grouping", I believe. </p>
<p>Lets see how much we can delete and still have something working:</p>
<p>&lt;?prettify? data-preserve-html-node="true"&gt;</p>
<pre data-preserve-html-node="true" class="prettyprint">var path = svg.append("g")
    .attr("transform", "translate(" + width / 2 + "," + height / 2 + ")") // this centers the graphic inside of the viewable pane
    .attr("fill", "none") // this fills the enter of the graphic with white. Loots really cool if you take it away.
    .attr("stroke-width", 10) // width of the lines
    .attr("stroke-linejoin", "round")
  .selectAll("path")
  .data(["cyan", "magenta", "yellow"])
  .enter().append("path")
    .attr("stroke", function(d) { return d; })

    .datum(function(d, i) {
      return d3.radialLine()
          .curve(d3.curveLinearClosed)
          .angle(function(a) { return a; })
          .radius(function(a) {
            var t = d3.now() / 1000;
            return 200 + Math.cos(a * 8 - i * 2 * Math.PI / 3 + t) * Math.pow((1 + Math.cos(a - t)) / 2, 3) * 32;
          });
    });
</pre>

<p>That's it for now. Lots more to learn, but I think I'm ready to dig into some uber-basic D3 tutorials. It helps to know how to use the docs and look up anything uncertain.</p>

      <title>Psychological Barriers</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/03/18/psychological-barriers</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently took a HUGE step in my career. It marked a turning point, when I went to "old Josh" to "new Josh".
It happened in a day. A click, really.</p>
<p>What was this step?</p>
<p>I sent an email.</p>
<p><strong>Prolonging the inevitable, for as long as possible.</strong></p>
<p>I'm a business consultant, you see. I help businesses improve their relationships with their customers, to build trust and reduce "friction". I have a lot of ideas and can see areas where small improvements would lead to big change.</p>
<p>At that point, I had no clients.</p>
<p>I have spent weeks and months thinking about consulting. I've read blogs and books about it. I've visited local businesses and walked away with a list of changes they could make that would ease their customer acquisition process, increase the lifetime value of the customer, and possibly even cut costs for the business. All these things increase revenues by either generating additional income or decreasing costs.</p>
<p>I've done everything I can do to equip myself to consult except for one small step.</p>
<p><em>I have not offered my services to any business.</em></p>
<p>That changed Thursday, January 10, 2013. I had not heard back from them, but I sent an email. I don't know if anyone will read it. It probably won't turn into work. I'll be lucky if I hear back from them when they say "No thanks".</p>
<p><em>None of that matters.</em></p>
<p>If I've reached out to one business, I can reach out to five. Or ten. If I have a useful product (I do) eventually it will stick. Once it does, my life will have changed.</p>
<p><strong>I avoided reaching out to a real-life, honest-to-god businesses because I feared failure<em>.</em></strong></p>
<p>I changed my perspective. My goal is to now accumulate rejections, not consulting gigs. I redefined success so that reaching out to a business is only part of my goal; regardless of what they tell me, or if they tell me anything, I have succeeded.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Tackle Fear by Understanding the Belay</title>
      <link>/blog/tackle-fear-by-understanding-the-belay</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Climbing rocks, but being scared out of your mind sucks.&nbsp;</p><p>Even when you’re not scared out of your mind (oh, that’s just me?)<em> it’s frustrating to not meet your own goals of trying hard</em>. When you&nbsp;can’t send your project, you wish you could at least gun it at the end and make those last few moves rather than dejectedly letting go.</p><blockquote><em>A good hold is just three moves (and a scary clip) away! Why do I hesitate, give a half-hearted&nbsp;“throw”, and drop off the wall?!?!</em></blockquote><p>That thought process rolls through my head more often than I'd like to admit.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s a few bits of psychology that go into the decisions you make when you are feeling fear (either consciously or unconsciously), but <em>today I want to dig into something that isn’t in your own head. It’s how well you (and by extension, your partner) belay.&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>Here is proof that the quality of your belayer is very important&nbsp;to you (especially if you think any belayer will do)</strong></p><ol><li><strong>You would not let <em>someone who does not rock climb</em>&nbsp;belay you</strong>. They don’t have the minimum skills required, right?</li><li><strong>You would let a newbie belay you, <em>but you wouldn’t climb a challenging route</em>.</strong> They have not proven themselves to be trustworthy yet.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>When you (and your belayer) learned to belay, you quickly moved through the "newbie belayer" stage, and achieved&nbsp;a certain level of proficiency.&nbsp;<em>You probably have not gotten much better at belaying since than.</em></p><p>Here is a quick guide to being an amazing belayer. There are other things that matter, but if you (and your belayer) keep the following three principles in mind, you will have proven to your climber (and vice versa) that they are in good hands when run out, chicken winging, and are deciding between clipping the bolt or going for the jug.&nbsp;</p><p> </p><h2 class="text-align-center">Stand in the right spot</h2><p>Don’t stand more than <em>one large step</em>&nbsp;from directly beneath the bolt. (I’m talking about a traditional indoor climbing gym where bolts are generally 12 feet (3 meters) high or lower.&nbsp;</p><p>When the climber is low to the ground, stand to one side so the rope does not <em>ever</em>&nbsp;lie between their legs. Imagine they fell right after clipping the first bolt. If they could end up straddling the rope, you need to move.&nbsp;</p><p>In the below gif, compare the left side (bad) with the right (good). Same climb, similar clipping stance, but if the climber fell right after clipping, she’d not be happy on the left.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="text-align-center"> </h2><h2 class="text-align-center"> </h2><h2 class="text-align-center">Move around as needed</h2><p>Just like your climber is moving on the wall (I hope) so too should you, as the belayer, move around. There are a few different situations where you should move around, but the most common (and predictable) is when your climber is clipping.&nbsp;</p><p>On the left, the belayer steps towards the wall to create a little more slack. (This also has the benefit of allowing her to quickly take slack out of the system if needed just by stepping back.)</p><p>On the right, she doesn’t move at all. This is the difference between being able to clip without getting short roped, and getting short roped. This movement is also an indicator of an attentive belayer. So when your climber is clipping, get in the habit of stepping into the wall to give them a little more slack. (There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, but you’ve got to know the rules in order to know when to break them, right?)</p>

<h2 class="text-align-center"> </h2><h2 class="text-align-center">When your climber&nbsp;“gets air” and takes a&nbsp;whip, you should too.</h2><p>I’ve saved the best for last. When your climber falls (which should be common) you need to “give a soft catch” to keep them from “getting spiked” because <em>f=m*v^2</em> and other such jargon.&nbsp;</p><p>Just watch these a few times:</p>

       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="605.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16/55b3fc1be4b0e4109a72ed1e/1437859011472/Getting+spiked+vs.+getting+a+soft+catchGetting+spiked+vs.+getting+a+soft+catch?format=original" alt="Getting a soft catch (left) vs. getting spiked (right)"/> Getting a soft catch (left) vs. getting spiked (right)[/caption]


<p>Which one looks more comfortable? Watch, again, carefully. What is the climber doing with her hands? Her feet? What happens to the belayer?</p><p>The climber is “getting a soft catch” on the left. She is “getting spiked” on the right. &nbsp;</p><p>If she were working a really hard move and had to take that fall five or six times in a row, which one do you think would inspire confidence? Which one would make her leery of falling?&nbsp;</p><p>The only difference between these is that the belayer gave a hop on the left, and did not give a hop on the right.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Now what?</strong></p><p>These are three changes you can make to your belaying next time you put your harness on. Send this to your belayer, so they can improve too. Once you’ve both made these changes, you’ll feel a little more confident next time you are on the wall.&nbsp;</p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Getting an Awesome Lead Head</title>
      <link>/blog/787</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">I'm going to geek out on some technical elements of climbing here.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of my favorite things to do is to teach people things. Yes, things. Anything that I have that could be of interest or use to someone else, chances are good I'd love to talk about it. (This can make me a drag in social situations. Sorry everyone...)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another thing I really like is psychology. More specifically, decision-making and cognition. I love to understand how two people can see the exact same piece of "evidence", or hear the same story, and immediately (and confidently) reach diametrically opposed conclusions. The explanation is actually pretty simple - it has to do with prior experiences and a cognitive framework.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Finally, I love climbing. I think it's good for you, and it's a great opportunity to develop oneself in a variety of ways, all without taking yourself too seriously. (How seriously can you take yourself after spending a week in the woods without a shower, grunting and screaming like a maniac, just to get up this rock that you could easily walk to the top of? It <em>is</em> all a little ridiculous. And this is why I love it.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">If I were to integrate these things, I would find I loved teaching people about the psychology behind decision-making while climbing. I've found this to be true, so while I worked at a climbing gym, I found myself naturally drawn to helping individual climbers (and their belayers) develop their belaying skills, so they could trust each other more while climbing, and they would, rather quickly, feel much more comfortable in situations where they once felt miserable. I saw a need to be filled, so I developed a curriculum which helped teach lead climbers and belayers how to get awesome at belaying and understanding what happened (and what to do) when a climber falls. This led to a lot of learning, both on my behalf and theirs, and it is my pleasure to present that information to you today.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I recently came across an <a href="http://rigsend.com/a-very-rigsend-guide-to-sport-climbing-part-ii-there-is-nothing-to-fear-but/">article</a> about sport climbing, and more specifically, falling. The advice contained within the article is all true, but not easy to put into practice. And, if done incorrectly, it could make it even <em>harder</em> to get comfortable falling, even if you are practicing it regularly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the past, I put a <em>lot</em> of time and effort into helping lead climbers and their belayers develop the tools they needed to become experts at climbing at their limit, be it 5.8 or 5.13. Today, I'm going to try to lay out a framework for you, so you too can understand how to safely sport climb at your absolute limit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">First, the requisite warning: <em>Sport climbing is dangerous, and it gets much more dangerous if you ever hit the ground with any kind of force. Please don't do that! I'm assuming that those who read this know the basics of sport climbing, and will not do something stupid like not tie in to the rope, or set the belay device up backwards. Lets not win any Darwin Awards, OK?</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">The goal of this blog is as follows: <strong>to improve your ability to take <em>and</em> catch falls. This article focuses equal parts on the belayer and the climber, with the goal of dramatically reducing the climbers' perceived fear of falling by building substantial skill on behalf of the belayer. Both will have an increased understanding of risk mitigation and management.
</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Phew. Got that out of the way. Here we go.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most discussions about "getting better at falling" focus on the mental game of the leader. "Start with small falls" goes the normal advice, "then move to bigger falls."</p>
<p dir="ltr">While this isn't totally wrong, there are two important elements missing. First, and most importantly, <strong>should you trust your belayer? </strong>Have you noticed that you climb harder when you trust your belayer? This is your subconscious rewarding you for making an evolutionary sound choice. Good belayer = less chance of seriously hurting yourself. For the record, there's a lot more to good belaying than just not dropping your climber. It's all about giving a soft catch, which reduces the likelihood of an injury. Most people think "yes, I trust my belayer" but their body (and thus their climbing style) says "no, I do not trust my belayer."</p>
<p dir="ltr">Next, assuming you should trust your belayer, <strong>is it safe for you to fall?</strong> The answer to that question differs wildly, but most people subconscious says to "no, it is not safe for me to fall." while they convince themselves "yes, it is safe for me to fall." Please note that this answer first depends on the belayer (are they trustworthy) and then, and only then, can it be contingent upon the actual situation you're in on the rock. Ledges, marginal gear, pendulums, and good old-fashion "I-really-really-don't-want-to-fall-right-now" all factor into the decision of safety. If you've got a clean fall and good gear but do not trust your belayer, <strong>it is not safe for you to fall!</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">When in doubt, assume your instincts are correct. Give yourself permission to not want to fall. It's not a matter of bravery or a proper understanding of physics. An aversion to falling comes from a sense of self-preservation. Don't get in the habit of fighting that instinct.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The most important element[title]</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">To be good at falling, you must trust your belayer. A belayer is one who can belay. An excellent belayer is not just able to belay, but is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attentive</li>
<li>Quick to respond</li>
<li>Able to <em>always</em> give soft catches</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"> There are a few ways to determine if your belayer is excellent:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Ask them "Are you a good belayer? How do you know?" </strong>If they can explain the many different considerations they must evaluate when deciding how to catch a fall, and how they respond in various situations, you can be confident they at least have an intellectual understanding of good belaying.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If they just say "yeah, I've never dropped anyone", you probably don't have an <em>excellent</em> belayer on your hands. They may be good, but you'll probably end up spiked, or short roped, or dropped too far<em>. </em><em></em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Take a few practice falls.</strong> If they give you a soft catch, great! If they don't give you a soft catch, you don't have an <em>excellent</em> belayer on your hands.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is the quickest way to evaluate your belayer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are situations like <a href="http://www.rockandice.com/video-gallery/weekend-whipper-40-foot-fall-in-the-red">this</a> one that could be mitigated with better belaying.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Strategic overview: Of all the members who lead climb, few are likely to climb completely without fear; a good indicator of climbing without fear is frequent falling on all areas of the wall, and climbing “hard” on lead. There should be no discrepancy between TR grades and lead grades. If there is a discrepancy, there either is a fear of falling or a technical weakness in clipping.</p>
<p>Most people can identify a difference in their climbing based on their confidence in their belayer. Climbers climb differently with a talented and trusted belayer than they do with an unknown or unskilled belayer. The goal of the class is to develop the “soft skills” of the belayer and climber in such a fashion that trust is built between the two, as the climber slowly and progressively builds trust and confidence in the system as the belayer develops his or her own skills.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sellable product: This class will teach students to truly push themselves on the sharp end, while being relaxed and trying hard; upon gaining comfort with lead falling and belaying, their entire roped climbing experience will dramatically change for the better. This class is an investment in the overall climbing experience both for the climber and the belayer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Class Format:</p>
<p dir="ltr">1. Introduction</p>
<p dir="ltr">2. Reasons for class</p>
<p dir="ltr">3. Reasons gym is offering class</p>
<p dir="ltr">4. Format of class</p>
<p dir="ltr">5. Discussion of safety, risk mitigation, etc.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Quickly move on to the exercises.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There is a progression in difficulty from mentally easy to mentally hard(er), but none of the individual steps are larger than any other individual steps. (I.E. you will be constantly outside your comfort zone, but because your comfort zone will be growing, you’ll always be the same distance outside your comfort zone, when doing whip-specific training. If your “comfort zone” is three feet wide, and you’re OK being six inches outside of it, eventually your comfort zone will be six feet wide, and you’ll still be six inches outside of it. Same level of discomfort, but three more feet of comfort zone.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Emphasize importance of belayer throughout class. An “advanced” climber should not fall in a challenging spot on the wall without having a skilled belayer below them. It’s not a matter of dealing with fear, it’s about building trust.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Exercise progression:</p>
<p dir="ltr">The whole class should be lead climb/belay certified. Teach the class the double bowline and how to check it, and have them all use it! Instructors must demonstrate each new level of practice, and constantly emphasize not being far outside of your comfort zone.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stage 1 Climbing/Belaying</p>
<p dir="ltr">1. TR falls at third or fourth bolt. Work primarily with belayer to get them comfortable with the timing of jumping up the wall to give climber a soft catch. Third bolt is recommended because it will regularly bring belayer and climber into close contact with each other. This is initially uncomfortable and seems dangerous. It’s not, so we might as well not let the students get in the mindset of fearing it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If belayer is having problems with the timing and direction of jump, practice that action with them by clipping the rope through the first bolt, and taking mock falls by pulling hard on the rope.</p>
<p dir="ltr">2. Move two or three holds higher, and take progressive falls, as the climber feels comfortable with. When they can fall with the bolt at their knees or feet without significant discomfort, they’ve mastered Stage 1 climbing</p>
<p dir="ltr">- If belayer is able to give soft catches throughout, they’ve mastered stage 1 belaying.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stage 2 Climbing</p>
<p dir="ltr">In stage 2 climbing training, we’re going to start removing the decision-making process from the climber. They will begin to lose control of when they will fall.</p>
<p dir="ltr">1. Climber climbs to third or fourth bolt, and when they’ve clipped above them, an instructor tells them to fall. They have two seconds to let go of the wall.</p>
<p dir="ltr">2. Climber climbs above bolt, and instructor tells them to fall. They have two seconds.</p>
<p dir="ltr">3. Same steps as before, but with the belayer calling out the falls.</p>
<p dir="ltr">4. Climber climbs and falls just before they were going to clip next bolt (as long as they were clipping between head and hip level)</p>
<p dir="ltr">5. Climber falls (per belayer’s instruction) with slack out to clip next bolt. Belayer should move slack back through belay device, and give soft catch. Upon being able to do this, climber has mastered stage two climbing!</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stage 2 Belaying</p>
<p dir="ltr">1. TR falls at second bolt. Work with belayer to teach them to take in slack and still hop up the wall.</p>
<p dir="ltr">2. Just above second-bolt falls. Work with belayer until he is capable of moving slack through belay device, but still hops up the wall.</p>
<p dir="ltr">3. Farther above second-bolt, still with good belaying. (Feel free to use “knee-to-the-ground” method)</p>
<p dir="ltr">4. Just by third bolt, but have not clipped it. This is a challenge for the belayer, not the climber.</p>
<p dir="ltr">5. Falling while clipping third bolt. Belayer must move slack through the device, and still give climber a soft catch. It’s acceptable that the climber lands on the ground. If belayer can do this, he’s a Stage 2 belayer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stage 3 climbing and belaying</p>
<p dir="ltr">1. Climber should be able to fall clipping second bolt safely. Belayer moves slack backwards through belay device, and still gives soft catch. It’s expected that climber ends on the ground, and is not spiked.</p>
<p dir="ltr">2. Should we cover skipping bolts? I (Josh) don’t think so. We cannot formally advocate it, and if they are comfortable falling while clipping, it shouldn’t represent a true barrier to their send attempts. (50 Words for Pump, RRG 5.14d the crux is clipping. One climber changed the crux clip, sent, and became the focal point of a discussion about if he should still get credit for the send.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">In theory, upon reaching this arbitrary stage, the class participants should be in a good place to go forth and try hard. Perhaps we should let them know that there can be relapses in mental fortitude, and it may be necessary to spend time intentionally practicing their mental and technical game. This class is not intended to just get people in and make them fall for a long time, but it’s intended to teach a very finite constellation of skills to a climber/belayer, and send them back to the gym or crag, ready to rumble.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Details to keep in mind:</p>
<p dir="ltr">- Some climbers may have a significant discomfort with the act of falling. Identify these individuals, and explain to them some sports psychology about worst-case scenario thinking, and the importance of not just trying to push through the discomfort. If they push through the discomfort without dealing with it, they will never grow comfortable progressing into more and more challenging situations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">- It is reasonable for a staff member to belay the climber for ten or fifteen “easy” falls in quick succession, if climber is willing, in order to create a sense of comfort with said easy fall. If they are comfortable now, they will recognize the “sense of peace” felt when taking a fall. This peacefulness we hope to maintain throughout the course.</p>
<p dir="ltr">- Feel free to give plenty of demonstrations, with the staff belaying each other. Emphasize the role of weight differences, and demonstrate how the process of catching falls changes based on who is heavier.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I hope this is helpful to all who have read it. Feel free to get in touch with me if you have further questions or find it particularly helpful.</p>]]></content:encoded>

I also see money as a proxy of value, so if I accumulate money, that means I've delivered value.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Spending</strong></h3><ul><li>Track spending. How much goes out every month, what percentage of income is it? (done - write about YNAB)</li><li>Categorize spending. How much is regular, how much is variable. (Discretionary vs. non-discretionary.) (done - write about YNAB)</li><li>Save half of our income for one month (done)</li><li>Save half of our income for two months (done)</li><li>Save half of our income for three months (Done - YNAB reduced expenses, I maxed out 401k, roth, etc. Write about this.)</li><li>Negotiate rent reduction (even just $50/month) - possible prepay by the quarter? Willing to do so for $100/month decrease in rent. (Was given free parking pass)</li><li>Negotiate Comcast internet bill back down to the $30/month I was paying.&nbsp;(Got it reduced by $15/mo for one year)</li></ul><h3>Saving</h3><ul><li>Max out employer match for 401K (done)</li><li>Open Roth IRA (done)</li><li>Create automatic transfers to Roth, other savings accounts. (done)</li><li>Create savings accounts for long-term goals (done)</li><li>Carry no debt but student loans, and finish those up at above-minimum-payments. (done)</li></ul><h3>Earning</h3><p>There are two ways to have more money. Spend less, or earn more. I like the idea of both, so I have quite a few "on-the-side" financial goals, in addition to optimizing a fixed income as much as possible.</p><ul><li>Earn $100 by selling unneeded clothes and crap (yardsale - was a lot of work, worth it?)</li><li>Sign up for Odesk or Elance. (I choose to not do this. See "freelancing and decommodifying your services" - DYFR)</li><li>Meet with one company about Customer Experience freelance product (done)</li><li>Earn/book one job w/Elance or Odesk (nope)</li><li>Land one contract w/CX Freelance (Instant level up here) UX Feedback/implementation with KMDC Training Center!</li><li>Schedule a meeting to discuss compensation with manager</li><li>Earn a raise based off of my initiative. Minimum: $2/hr or $4000/yr. (done)</li><li>Meet with one freelance consultant, learn</li><li>Meet with three more consultants, to learn from them</li><li>Pay consultant for three hours of formal training</li><li>Earn $500/mo in "on-the-side" projects.</li><li>Earn $1000/mo in "on-the-side" projects.</li><li>Sell one digital product. (done)</li><li>Sell ten copies of a digital product.</li><li>Sell one copy of a digital product without being involved in the process. (done)</li></ul><h3>Investing</h3><ul><li>Read three books about investing and the stock market (done. Motley Fool, I will teach you to be rich, and "money, master the game")</li><li>Open a mock stock market account (free, no actual money involved) to practice. (nope)</li><li>Open savings account that will provide stock market money. (yep)</li><li>Set up automatic transfers for stock market money account (done)</li><li>Buy minimum number of stocks in 1 company (nope)</li><li>Buy three more minimums in three other companies (Forrester's CXI Top 5 companies)</li><li>Don't touch the money for a year</li></ul><h1><strong>Reading</strong></h1><p>Reading is a tremendous gift. There are wise, experienced people out there who have done what you want to do, done what you don't want to do, and lived through every imaginable experience. Sometimes it comes across as fiction, sometimes as non-fiction. It is all worthwhile. Reading can change your life.</p><p>Another benefit of reading is just about every thought in the world has been had before. If you claim to hold strong ideas, but don't know who it is that had them first, you're just repackaging (without attribution) the ideas of someone else. It makes it hard to have reasonable discussions when both parties think they're having a bunch of original thoughts.</p><ul><li>Read 56 books/yr, at 225 pages/book (or ~225 pages/week). Some books are much longer than that, so if I read a 500 page book, it's fine that it takes two weeks. (Have met this goal regularly, so I'll just leave it open.)</li><li><a target="_blank" href="http://josh.works/read">I read a ton, so here's a partial list.</a></li></ul><h1><strong>Marriage</strong></h1><p>Money can buy happiness, but only until you can pay for "the basics", like shelter and sustenance. After $40K a year or so, it no longer is a predictor of happiness. There are a few things that correlate well with happiness and are independent of income: Experiences, relationships, and serving others. Those three can be tightly linked with happiness.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Surprise Kristi with something (flowers, a gift, a note) once a week.</li><li>Take Kristi on one date a week</li><li>Have entry in OUR journal/record once a week.</li><li>Improve quality of our fights.</li><li>Read and re-read quality marriage books together</li><li>Find a mentor couple. Meet once every other month.</li><li>Mentor a couple. Meet once every other month.</li><li>Seek out wise old people (WOP) to spend time with. Each meeting is a level.</li></ul><h1><strong>Traveling (experiences)</strong></h1><ul><li>Sign up for credit cards that earns miles a la <a target="_blank" href="http://frequentflyermaster.com/">Frequent Flier Master</a>. (done)</li><li>Earn 30,000 miles (additional levels @ 30,000 miles each. I stand currently at about 100,000 miles, with plenty of room to improve.) (done)</li><li>Earn in-flight or at-gate seat upgrade. (One level per upgrade) (I earned two "upgrade to exit-row" levels) (Saved $130, were I to pay outright for 'em)(And upgraded another five flights or so...)</li><li>Redeem miles for ticket (one level per passenger per flight. If Kristi and I go to Paraguay and it's two stops, that equals four levels) (Redeemed for flight to Colorado) (done)</li><li>Kristi and I book international itineraries for less than $1000 total.</li><li>Book round-the-world tickets for Kristi and I within two years. This spring: Paraguay (visit four other countries while there)</li><li>Spend one month traveling. (done)</li><li>Spend one summer traveling. (done)</li></ul><h1><strong>Relationships</strong></h1><p>Relationships and experiences are what matters. Most other stuff doesn't. To that end:</p><ul><li>Implement <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Never-Eat-Alone-Secrets-Relationship/dp/0385512058/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1371182170&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=never+eat+alone">Never Eat Alone</a></em></li><li>Intentionally meet with one new person. (Per "Never Eat Alone") (Done, seven times)</li><li>Get counseling via CCEF (done)&nbsp;</li><li>Host at least one person for at least dinner once a month. Get good at it, so it's easy. (4/13 5/13 6/13 7/13 8/13) (9/13)</li><li>Reply to all personal emails within 24 hrs for two weeks. (done)</li><li>Reply to emails I don't want to reply to when I see them, even if just to say "I got this message - don't have time to reply right now, but I'll get back to you in a few hours."&nbsp;One level per week.</li><li>Follow up via email with every person I meet 24 hrs, 1 month, six months out. (link to personal CRM)</li><li>Compose "Wish List" of people or companies I'd like to meet.</li><li>Seek out, get to know, and meet with one person from the wish list.</li></ul><h1><strong>Serving Others</strong></h1><p>I am rich in relationships, freedom, time, money, health, and many other ways. Even if I were not, I should serve others.</p><ul><li>Set aside fixed percentage of income to give away. (done)</li><li>Be on the lookout for spontaneous opportunities to help. (I.E. changing tires, giving rides, running errands, etc.) (Given a half-dozen rides, changed a few tires, bought someone a meal, etc.)</li></ul><h1><strong>Stuff</strong></h1><p>Stuff ties you down. Some things are worth being tied to, most are not.

Christian, if you mourn for hypocrisy—yet find this sin so potent that you cannot get the mastery of it, go to Christ. Beg of him that he would exercise his kingly office in your soul, that he would subdue this sin, and put it under the yoke. Beg of Christ to exercise his spiritual surgery upon you. Desire him to lance your heart and cut out the rotten flesh, and that he would apply the medicine of his blood to heal you of your hypocrisy. Say that prayer of David often: “Let my heart be sound in your statutes” (Psalm 119:80). “Lord, let me be anything rather than a hypocrite.” A double-heart will exclude from one heaven.

Did your family consider itself rich, poor or just average? Did you grow up in a family where money was discussed openly? Or was it considered impolite to talk about money? Did you have an allowance? Did you have to earn it by doing chores? Did it set you apart from your peers because you had less or more money than others? Who handled the money in your family? How did they feel about it? Did you grow up believing your family had enough money to buy you anything you really wanted and needed? If your parents said no to one of your desires, was it because of money? In your family did you associate money with rewards? With arguments? With never seeing your father? What were the messages your parents gave you about money? The vast majority of divorces are over money, as you can well imagine once you understand how each of us is brought up in a different financial environment. Just answering these questions could be life-changing. Take some time to reflect on them. Or take an evening with your mate and share your answers. Mine them for all they are worth.

Each morning, write down three things you’re grateful for. Not the same three every day; find three new things to write about. That trains your brain to search your circumstances and hunt for the positive. Journal for two minutes a day about one positive experience you’ve had over the past twenty-four hours. Write down every detail you can remember; this causes your brain to literally reexperience the experience, which doubles its positive impact. Meditate daily. Nothing fancy; just stop all activity, relax, and watch your breath go in and out for two minutes. This trains your brain to focus where you want it to, and not get distracted by negativity in your environment. Do a random act of kindness over the course of each day. To make this simple, Shawn often recommends a specific act of kindness: at the start of each day, take two minutes to write an email to someone you know praising them or thanking them for something they did. Exercise for fifteen minutes daily. Simple cardio, even a brisk walk, has a powerful antidepressant impact, in many cases stronger (and more long-lasting) than an actual antidepressant!

We are discussing here the virtue of teachability—a virtue that is almost always misunderstood. Teachability is often confused with subservience. A person is wrongly thought to be teachable if he is passive and pliable. On the contrary, teach-ability is an extremely active virtue. No one is really teachable who does not freely exercise his power of independent judgment. He can be trained, perhaps, but not taught. The most teachable reader is, therefore, the most critical. He is the reader who finally responds to a book by the greatest effort to make up his own mind on the matters the author has discussed. We say “finally” because teachability

Stumbling on Happiness (Daniel Gilbert)

The sad fact is that converting wealth to utility—that is, predicting how we will feel from knowledge of what we will get—isn’t very much like converting meters to yards or German to Japanese. The simple, lawful relationships that bind numbers to numbers and words to words do not bind objective events to emotional experiences. So what’s a chooser to do? Without a formula for predicting utility, we tend to do what only our species does: imagine. Our brains have a unique structure that allows us to mentally transport ourselves into future circumstances and then ask ourselves how it feels to be there. Rather than calculating utilities with mathematical precision, we simply step into tomorrow’s shoes and see how well they fit. Our ability to project ourselves forward in time and experience events before they happen enables us to learn from mistakes without making them and to evaluate actions without taking them. If nature has given us a greater gift, no one has named it. And yet, as impressive as it is, our ability to simulate future selves and future circumstances is by no means perfect. When we imagine future circumstances, we fill in details that won’t really come to pass and leave out details that will. When we imagine future feelings, we find it impossible to ignore what we are feeling now and impossible to recognize how we will think about the things that happen later. Daniel Bernoulli dreamed of a world in which a simple formula would allow us all to determine our futures with perspicacity and foresight. But foresight is a fragile talent that often leaves us squinting, straining to see what it would be like to have this, go there, or do that. There is no simple formula for finding happiness. But if our great big brains do not allow us to go surefootedly into our futures, they at least allow us to understand what makes us stumble.

Remember that the amygdala, and the limbic system of which it’s a key part, is an ancient part of the brain—so old that primitive mammals have their own versions of this system. But as mammals became more complex, an area of the brain called the neocortex developed around the limbic system. The neocortex, and particularly the frontal cortex in humans, performs an astonishing array of functions, from deciding which brand of toothpaste to buy, to planning a meeting, to pondering the nature of reality. One of these functions is to soothe unwarranted fears. If you were a high-reactive baby, then your amygdala may, for the rest of your life, go a bit wild every time you introduce yourself to a stranger at a cocktail party. But if you feel relatively skilled in company, that’s partly because your frontal cortex is there to tell you to calm down, extend a handshake, and smile. In fact, a recent fMRI study shows that when people use self-talk to reassess upsetting situations, activity in their prefrontal cortex increases in an amount correlated with a decrease of activity in their amygdala. But the frontal cortex isn’t all-powerful; it doesn’t switch the amygdala off altogether. In one study, scientists conditioned a rat to associate a certain sound with an electrical shock. Then they played that sound over and over again without administering the shock, until the rats lost their fear. But it turned out that this “unlearning” was not as complete as the scientists first thought. When they severed the neural connections between the rats’ cortex and amygdala, the rats became afraid of the sound again. This was because the fear conditioning had been suppressed by the activity of the cortex, but was still present in the amygdala. In humans with unwarranted fears, like batophobia, or fear of heights, the same thing happens. Repeated trips to the top of the Empire State Building seem to extinguish the fear, but it may come roaring back during times of stress—when the cortex has other things to do than soothe an excitable amygdala.

Improve the Way You Work Another benefit of starting smaller is that you can channel your innovative impulses to making your day-to-day job easier. Once you’ve got your feet under you, do an audit of all the tasks you have to accomplish in a month and ask yourself the following questions: ·         What is the most painful or annoying part of my job? ·         Where do I and others make the most errors? ·         Where do the systems or tools I have to use get in the way or make my life difficult? ·         Which people should know what I’m working on, but don’t? ·         Do I spend inordinate time on repetitive manual tasks that could be automated? ·         Am I creating certain outputs that don’t add any value (e.g., no one reads them)? ·         Do I regularly lack the information I need to do some part of my job? Take your answers to these questions and do your own root-cause analysis. If this is a new concept to you, root-cause analysis is straightforward. For each of the answers you come up with to the above questions ask why situation is as it is. For example, let’s say you spend two hours each week summarizing your competitors’ press releases for your managers, but you know they don’t read it. You put it together because your manager told you to, so why did she ask for it? Dig through a few more of these “why” layers, asking others where necessary, and maybe you learn that a few senior managers were called out for not being aware of new products your competitors had introduced. So in response, they asked you to create this summary each week to help them stay on top of things. Now that you understand why you’re putting together this report, you might see better ways to provide managers with the information they need. Or you might start from a different angle and ask why you’re doing something so tedious in the first place. Regardless, your audit is guaranteed to reveal at least a few things that could be done more efficiently or effectively, or simply don’t merit the time investment you’re making.

Capitalize on Unused Information in Your Company If you’ve been working for a few years, you have likely by now experienced the frustration of working on something only to find out that it wasn’t needed because someone else already had already done what you’re doing. This happens because, (a) most of the big questions you can ask about the business have been asked before, and (b) it’s easy for companies to lose track of what they know. The upshot is there’s a good chance that someone has tried to answer them before and captured their findings somewhere. The following sources can be treasure troves of information for you: ·         Customer satisfaction surveys ·         Reports prepared by consultants and market research agencies ·         Internal presentations sitting in document management systems ·         Sales call notes stored in a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system ·         Online reviews of your product or service, if applicable Pay special attention to the information that is the hardest for others to digest. The “unstructured” data in the form of customer feedback forms, salespeople’s notes, and so on and so on are ideal. Not only do these sources contain valuable insights, but because people can’t easily absorb them they often go under-utilized. It’s amazing how much information at big companies goes unused because it is in an inconvenient format. If you want to learn enough about the business to substantially improve it, you must go where others dare not tread. All of this abandoned information is gold just waiting to be mined.

REMOVE THE PRESSURE OF TIME Historically, call centers have operated under an unchallenged assumption—the faster the call, the more efficient the operation. Shorter calls mean more calls per hour, which can be handled by fewer reps. Efficiency is tracked through a metric known as AHT—average handle time. It’s the average length of all calls from all customers, and it’s measured in a wide variety of ways: Overall AHT for the entire operation Handle time of various customer segments or among users of various company products AHT by shift, or by individual supervisors, and down to the level of each individual rep Regardless of how it’s measured, every person in the service department knows that every call is being timed. It’s like the clock is always ticking, and no one can escape its scrutiny. This measurement system is omnipresent, and creates both a subconscious pressure as well as a contradictory set of goals for every rep. It doesn’t take long for people who are new to the service operation to realize that if they’re doing a good job of serving customers, but they’re taking longer than the average rep to do so, then what they’re doing isn’t considered a good job. But as the simple issues have been siphoned off by self-service and customer expectations for personalized service have begun to rise, service executives have recognized that the quality of the interaction is in fact much more important than just squeezing every drop of productivity out of every rep. How could a rep possibly be concentrating on providing unique, customized service to each individual customer when that clock is ticking louder and louder in their brain every second they’re still on the line with the customer?

Let's get the biggies out of the way first. Metzinger's Being No One99 is the toughest book I've ever read (and there are still significant chunks of it I haven't), but it also contains some of the most mindblowing ideas I've encountered in fact or fiction. Most authors are shameless bait-and-switchers when it comes to the nature of consciousness. Pinker calls his book How the Mind Works100, then admits on page one that "We don't understand how the mind works". Koch (the guy who coined the term "zombie agents") writes The Quest for Consciousness: A Neurobiological Approach101, in which he sheepishly sidesteps the whole issue of why neural activity should result in any kind of subjective awareness whatsoever. Towering above such pussies, Metzinger takes the bull by the balls. His "World-zero" hypothesis not only explains the subjective sense of self, but also why such an illusory first-person narrator would be an emergent property of certain cognitive systems in the first place. I have no idea whether he's right— the man's way beyond me— but at least he addressed the real question that keeps us staring at the ceiling at three a.m., long after the last roach is spent. Many of the syndromes and maladies dropped into Blindsight I first encountered in Metzinger's book. Any uncited claims or statements in this subsection probably hail from that source. If they don't, then maybe they hail from Wegner's The Illusion of Conscious Will102 instead. Less ambitious, far more accessible, Wegner's book doesn't so much deal with the nature of consciousness as it does with the nature of free will, which Wegner thumbnails as "our mind's way of estimating what it thinks it did.". Wegner presents his own list of syndromes and maladies, all of which reinforce the mind-boggling sense of what fragile and subvertible machines we are. And of course, Oliver Sacks103 was sending us memos from the edge of consciousness long before

In the next month: • Schedule three lunch dates to take place in upcoming weeks: one with a person a few rungs ahead of you in your industry; one with an old friend you haven’t seen in a while; and one with a person from an adjacent industry whose career you admire. Do this even if you aren’t currently facing a pressing career question or challenge. Probe on general, time-insensitive topics. Engaged conversation can sometimes lead to serendipitous intelligence. • Become a go-to person for other people in your network on certain topics. Make known to your connections your interests and skills by writing blog posts and emails, or setting up discussion groups. When people come to you for intelligence, you are simultaneously acquiring intelligence from them.

Deliberately underschedule yourself for a day next week to read a book you wouldn’t otherwise read, take a coworker in a different department out for lunch, or attend a speech or seminar in a different but related field. • Ask the most curious person you know out to lunch, and try to get infected by their sense of awe. In the next week: • Find an industry event or ideas conference to attend in the next six months. Book your ticket and transportation to the event. • Set aside one full day coming up to be a “yes day.” Say “yes” all day and note the serendipity that comes of it. • Opportunities are attached to people. Identify the people in your network who always seem to have their hands in interesting pots. Try to understand what makes them hubs of opportunity and resolve to meet more people with those characteristics. In the next month: • Start your own group or association. Maybe a regular luncheon or simply a one-time meetup—what’s important is that you try to convene friends to share ideas and resources. Set up a simple wiki or use LinkedIn groups or events to organize and share the details. • Subscribe to magazines like Wired or the MIT Technology Review and others like them—they tend to show a glimpse at what’s next. Identify friends who are early technology adopters. The goal? Understand how technological, economic, or social trends might create waves of new opportunities.

Then think hard about the real downside and upside possibilities and be sure you’re not exaggerating the overall riskiness. Where there’s uncertainty, are you mistakenly ascribing risk? In the next week: • Identify—and take on—risks that are acceptable to you but that others tend to avoid. Are you okay having less money in savings and taking a low-paying but high-learning job? Or maybe a month-to-month employment contract as opposed to something longer term? Go find a project with these sorts of risks. It will differentiate you from others. In the next month: • Make a plan to increase the short-term volatility in your life. How can you take on projects—or a new job—that involve more ups and downs, more uncertainty? • Revisit your Plan Z. Is it still viable? If your Plan A were to unravel, will you still be in the game?

As a first step, Peterson and Seligman surveyed every list of virtues they could find, from the holy books of major religions down to the Boy Scout Oath (“trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly . . . ”). They made large tables of virtues and tried to see which ones were common across lists. Although no specific virtue made every list, six broad virtues, or families of related virtues, appeared on nearly all lists: wisdom, courage, humanity, justice, temperance, and transcendence (the ability to forge connections to something larger than the self). These virtues are widely endorsed because they are abstract: There are many ways to be wise, or courageous, or humane, and it is impossible to find a human culture that rejects all forms of any of these virtues. (Can we even imagine a culture in which parents hope that their children will grow up to be foolish, cowardly, and cruel?) But the real value of the list of six is that it serves as an organizing framework for more specific strengths of character.

Peterson and Seligman suggest that there are twenty-four principle character strengths, each leading to one of the six higher-level virtues.19 You can diagnose yourself by looking at the list below or by taking the strengths test (at www.authentichappiness.org). 1. Wisdom: • Curiosity • Love of learning • Judgment • Ingenuity • Emotional intelligence • Perspective 2. Courage: • Valor • Perseverance • Integrity 3. Humanity: • Kindness • Loving 4. Justice: • Citizenship • Fairness • Leadership 5. Temperance: • Self-control • Prudence • Humility 6.

Instructions Part I: Monologue Person A speaks in monologue for 4 minutes. When you are speaking, maintain some mindfulness on your body (this is the dipping part). The entire 4 minutes belong to you, so if you run out of things to say, you can both sit in silence, and when you have something else to say later, you may just say it. Person B listens. Your job is to give your full attention to the speaker as a gift, while at the same time maintaining some mindfulness on your body (this is again the dipping part). You are giving him the gift of your attention, without losing awareness of your body. You may acknowledge, but do not over-acknowledge. You may not speak except to acknowledge. Part II: Resolution After that, B repeats back to A what she thinks she heard. B may start by saying, “What I heard you say was…” Immediately after, A gives feedback by telling B what he feels B got right or wrong (for example, what she missed, what she misrepresented, etc). Go back and forth until A is satisfied that he is completely understood by B. Do this for as long as it takes, or until 6 minutes are up. (This is the looping part). Then we switch places, so B gets to be the speaker and A the listener. After the exercise, spend 4 minutes in meta-conversation discussing the experience. Some suggested topics for conversation: • Your self-assessment. Your impressions of yourself, what you like, what you want to change, etc. • A difficult situation that happened recently or a long time ago that you want to talk about. • Any other topic that is meaningful to you.

So how do you sustain your practice up to the point it becomes so compelling that it is self-sustaining? We have three suggestions: 1. Have a buddy: We learned this from Norman Fischer, whom we jokingly call the Zen abbot of Google. Once again, we use the gym analogy. Going to the gym alone is hard, but if you have a gym buddy with whom you commit to going, you are much more likely to go regularly. This is partly because you have company and partly because this arrangement helps you encourage each other and hold each other accountable (what I jokingly call mutual harassment). We suggest finding a mindfulness buddy and committing to a fifteen-minute conversation every week, covering at least these two topics: • How am I doing with my commitment to my practice? • What has arisen in my life that relates to my practice? We also suggest ending the conversation with the question, how did this conversation go? We instituted this in Search Inside Yourself and found it very effective. 2. Do less than you can: This lesson came from Mingyur Rinpoche. The idea is to do less formal practice than you are capable of. For example, if you can sit in mindfulness for five minutes before it feels like a chore, then do not sit for five minutes—just do three or four minutes, perhaps a few times a day. The reason is to keep the practice from becoming a burden. If mindfulness practice feels like a chore, it’s not sustainable. Yvonne Ginsberg likes to say, “Meditation is an indulgence.” I think her insight beautifully captures the core of Mingyur’s idea. Do not sit for so long that it becomes burdensome. Sit often, for short periods, and your mindfulness practice may soon feel like an indulgence. 3. Take one breath a day: I may be the laziest mindfulness instructor in the world because I tell my students all they need to commit to is one mindful breath a day. Just one. Breathe in and breathe out mindfully, and your commitment for the day is fulfilled; everything else is a bonus. There are two reasons why one breath is important. The first is momentum. If you commit to one breath a day, you can easily fulfill this commitment and can then preserve the momentum of your practice. Later, when you feel ready for more, you can pick it back up easily. The second reason is creating the intention to meditate is itself a meditation. This practice encourages you to generate an intention to do something kind and beneficial to yourself daily, and over time, that self-directed kindness becomes a valuable mental habit. When self-directed kindness is strong, mindfulness becomes easier. Remember, one breath a day for the rest of your life. That is all I ask.

MEDITATION CIRCUIT TRAINING Let us begin by sitting comfortably in a position that enables you to be both relaxed and alert at the same time, whatever that means to you. Let us rest the mind. If you like, you can visualize the breath to be a resting place, or a cushion, or a mattress, and let the mind rest on it. (Short pause) Let us shift into focused attention. Bring your attention to your breath, or any other object of meditation you choose. Let this attention be stable like a rock, undisturbed by any distraction. If the mind is distracted, gently but firmly bring the mind back. Let’s continue this exercise for the remainder of 3 minutes. (Long pause) Now we shift into open attention. Bring your attention to whatever you experience and whatever comes to mind. Let this attention be flexible like grass moving in the wind. In this mind, there is no such thing as a distraction. Every object you experience is an object of meditation. Everything is fair game. Let us continue this exercise for the remainder of 3 minutes. (Long pause) (Shift to focused attention for 3 minutes. Then shift to open attention for 3 minutes.) Let us end this sitting by resting the mind. If you like, you can again visualize the breath to be a resting place, or a cushion, or a mattress, and let the mind rest on it. (Long pause) Thank you for your attention.

Regulation creates an environment in which reputation is less important because consumers think the government is protecting them. They think they don’t have to worry about it, so they don’t. If this weren’t the case—if people knew they had to rely on their own judgment, experience, and expertise, as well as that of sources they trust—reputation would become much more important in all markets around the world. Having a reputation for striving for the highest standards of business ethics, as well as in quality of products or services, would become a powerful competitive advantage and regulating force. So government regulation doesn’t protect the consumer, it really just makes things easier for the swindler. L: Pretty grim. But I’m an optimist.

When two people make a trade, each one expects to gain from it (if this were not so, the trade wouldn’t be made). And, if each trader has correctly estimated how much he values the things being traded, each does gain. This is possible because each person has a different frame of reference and, therefore, a different scale of values. For example, when you spend 30¢ for a can of beans, you do so because the can of beans is more valuable to you than the 30¢ (if it weren’t, you wouldn’t make the purchase). But, to the grocer, who has 60 cases of canned beans, the 30¢ is more valuable than one can of beans. So, both you and the grocer, acting from your different frames of reference, gain from your trade. In any trade in which the traders have correctly estimated their values and in which they are free to trade on the basis of these values without any outside interference, both buyer and seller must gain.

The United States of America, though theoretically a free country, suffers from an almost unbelievable amount of market regulation.1 Though often called a capitalistic country, the U.S.A. actually has a mixed economy—a mixture of some government-permitted “freedom,” a litde socialism, and a lot of fascism. Socialism is a system in which the government owns and controls the means of production (supposedly for “the good of the people,” but, in actual practice, for the good of the politicians). Facism is a system in which the government leaves nominal ownership of the means of production in the hands of private individuals but exercises control by means of regulatory legislation and reaps most of the profit by means of heavy taxation. In effect, facism is simply a more subtle form of government ownership than is socialism. Under fascism, producers are allowed to keep a nominal title to their possessions and to bear all the risks involved in entrepreneurship, while the government has most of the actual control and gets a great deal of the profits (and takes none of the risks). The U.S.A. is moving increasingly away from a free-market economy and toward fascist totalitarianism. It is commonly believed

Those who persist, in spite of all evidence to the contrary, in believing that totalitarianism makes a nation strong are revealing a sneaky admiration for dictatorship. Such an admiration springs from a psychological dependency which cannot conceive of having to be free and thrown on one’s own uncertain resources. The phychologically dependent man longs either to be led and directed in order to escape the responsibility of decision-making, or to dictate to others in order to convince himself of an efficacy he doesn’t possess.

In the course of a long and productive career, he was a sea captain, a cartographer, a professor of geometry at the University of Oxford, deputy controller of the Royal Mint, astronomer royal, and inventor of the deep-sea diving bell. He wrote authoritatively on magnetism, tides, and the motions of the planets, and fondly on the effects of opium. He invented the weather map and actuarial table, proposed methods for working out the age of the Earth and its distance from the Sun, even devised a practical method for keeping fish fresh out of season. The one thing he didn't do, interestingly enough, was discover the comet that bears his name. He merely recognized that the comet he saw in 1682 was the same one that had been seen by others in 1456, 1531, and 1607.

the realm of power, everything must be judged by its cost, and everything has a price. What is offered for free or at bargain rates often comes with a psychological price tag—complicated feelings of obligation, compromises with quality, the insecurity those compromises bring, on and on. The powerful learn early to protect their most valuable resources: independence and room to maneuver. By paying the full price, they keep themselves free of dangerous entanglements and worries. Being open and flexible with money also teaches the value of strategic generosity, a variation on the old trick of “giving when you are about to take.” By giving the appropriate gift, you put the recipient under obligation. Generosity softens people up—to be deceived. By gaining a reputation for liberality, you win people’s admiration while distracting them from your power plays. By strategically spreading your wealth, you charm the other courtiers, creating pleasure and making valuable allies.

The Bargain Demon. Powerful people judge everything by what it costs, not just in money but in time, dignity, and peace of mind. And this is exactly what Bargain Demons cannot do. Wasting valuable time digging for bargains, they worry endlessly about what they could have gotten elsewhere for a little less. On top of that, the bargain item they do buy is often shabby; perhaps it needs costly repairs, or will have to be replaced twice as fast as a high-quality item. The costs of these pursuits—not always in money (though the price of a bargain is often deceptive) but in time and peace of mind—discourage normal people from undertaking them, but for the Bargain Demon the bargain is an end in itself. These types might seem to harm only themselves, but their attitudes are contagious: Unless you resist them they will infect you with the insecure feeling that you should have looked harder to find a cheaper price. Don’t argue with them or try to change them. Just mentally add up the cost, in time and inner peace if not in hidden financial expense, of the irrational pursuit of a bargain.

TABLE 1 SEVEN POSSIBLE LEGAL CLASSIFICATIONS OF THE BANK-DEPOSIT CONTRACT WITH A FRACTIONAL RESERVE 1.There is deception or fraud: the crime of misappropriation is committed and the contract is null and void (the historically corrupt origin of fractional-reserve banking). 2.There is no deception, but there is an error in negotio: contract null and void. 3.There is no error in negotio, but each party pursues his typical cause in the contract: contract null and void due to essentially incompatible causes. 4.Even if the incompatible causes are considered compatible, the contract is null and void because it is impossible to carry out (without a central bank). 5.Subsidiary argument: even if the “law of large numbers” were valid (which is not the case), the contract would still be an aleatory contract (it would be neither a deposit nor a loan contract). 6.The implementation of the contract depends on a government mandate (privilege) and the support of a central bank that nationalizes money, imposes legal-tender regulations and creates liquidity. 7.In any case, the contract is null and void because it does serious harm to third parties (economic crises aggravated by the central bank), much greater harm than that caused by a counterfeiter of money.

support. To attempt to coordinate society via institutional coercion is an intellectual error, because it is theoretically impossible for an agency in charge of committing this type of aggression (a central planning board) to obtain the information it would need to establish social coordination with its decrees.75 The above is true for the following four reasons: first, it is impossible for the agency to constantly assimilate the enormous volume of practical information stored in the minds of different human beings; second, the subjective, practical, tacit, and nonverbal nature of most of the necessary information precludes its transmission to the central organ; third, information which actors have not yet discovered or created and which simply arises from the free market process, itself a product of entrepreneurship subject to the law, cannot be transmitted; and fourth, coercion keeps entrepreneurs from discovering or creating the information necessary to coordinate society. This is precisely the essence of the

appropriate legal nature. Quite the opposite is true. In most cases this contract is null and void, due to a discrepancy concerning its cause: depositors view the transaction as a deposit, while bankers view it as a loan. According to general legal principles, whenever the parties involved in an exchange hold conflicting beliefs as to the nature of the contract entered into, the contract is null and void. Moreover even

repetitively endanger banks’ solvency. According to general legal principles, contracts which are impossible to put into practice are also null and void. Only a 100-percent reserve requirement, which would guarantee the return of all deposits at any moment, or the support of a central bank, which would supply all necessary liquidity in times of difficulty, could make such “loan” contracts (with an agreement for the return of the face value at any time) possible and therefore valid. The argument that monetary

Hans-Hermann Hoppe158 explains that this type of contract is detrimental to third parties in at least three different ways. First, credit expansion increases the money supply and thereby diminishes the purchasing power of the monetary units held by all others with cash balances, individuals whose monetary units thus drop in buying power in relation to the value they would have had in the absence of credit expansion. Second, depositors in general are harmed, since the credit expansion process reduces the probability that, in the absence

Third, all other borrowers and economic agents are harmed, since the creation of fiduciary credit and its injection into the economic system jeopardizes the entire credit system and distorts the productive structure, thus increasing the risk that entrepreneurs will launch projects which will fail in the process of their completion and cause untold human suffering when credit expansion ushers in the

Required reading on this topic includes Roger W. Garrison’s “The Costs of a Gold Standard.”84 In this article, Professor Garrison estimates the opportunity costs of a purely fiduciary monetary standard and compares them with those of a pure gold standard and a 100-percent reserve requirement. Garrison states: The true costs of the paper standard would have to take into account (1) the costs imposed on society by different political factions in their attempts to gain control of the printing press, (2) the costs imposed by special-interest groups in their attempts to persuade the controller of the printing press to misuse its authority (print more money) for the benefit of special interests, (3) the costs in the form of inflation-induced misallocation of resources that occur throughout the economy as a result of the monetary authority succumbing to the political pressures of the special interests, and (4) the costs incurred by businesses in their attempts to predict what the monetary authority will do in the future and to hedge against likely, but uncertain, consequences of monetary irresponsibility. With these considerations in mind, it is not difficult to believe that a gold standard costs less than a paper standard.85

Once governments are given the power to benefit particular groups or sections of the population, the mechanism of majority government forces them to use it to gain the support of a sufficient number of them to command a majority. The constant temptation to meet local or sectional dissatisfaction by manipulating the quantity of money so that more can be spent on services for those clamouring for assistance will often be irresistible. Such expenditure is not an appropriate remedy but necessarily upsets the proper functioning of the market. In a true emergency such as

Favor reversibility. Prefer interventions that can easily be undone if they turn out to be mistakes.4 Irreversible interventions have irreversible consequences.5 Interventions into ecosystems require particular care in this respect, given our great ignorance about how they interact. Aldo Leopold captured the spirit of caution required: "The first rule of intelligent tinkering is to keep all the parts"° Plan on surprises. Choose plans that allow the largest accommodation to the unforeseen. In agricultural schemes this may mean choosing and preparing land so that it can grow any of several crops. In planning housing, it would mean "designing in" flexibility for accommodating changes in family structures or living styles. In a factory it may mean selecting a location, layout, or piece of machinery that allows for new processes, materials, or product lines down the road.

borrowing could strengthen military prowess, but it was England that shone as Hamilton’s true lodestar in public finance. Back in the 1690s, the British had set up the Bank of England, enacted an excise tax on spirits, and funded its public debt—that is, pledged specific revenues to insure repayment of its debt. During the eighteenth century, it had vastly expanded that public debt. Far from weakening the country, it had produced manifold benefits. Public credit had enabled England to build up the Royal Navy, to prosecute wars around the world, to maintain a global commercial empire. At the same time, government bonds issued to pay for the debt galvanized the economy, since creditors could use them as collateral for loans.

A British parliamentary committee, convened in 1878 to consider the prospects for Thomas Edison's incandescent lamp, reported Edison's ideas to be "good enough for our transatlantic friends, . . . but unworthy of the attention of practical or scientific men." Thomas Edison himself was a man of great vision, but he thought that the phonograph he invented would be employed mainly by businessmen for dictation. Only a short time before the Wright brothers proved that airplanes would fly, the distinguished American astronomer Simon Newcomb authoritatively demonstrated why heavier-than-air flight was impossible. He concluded: "The demonstration that no possible combination of known substances, known forms of machinery and known forms of force, can be united in a practical machine by which men shall fly long distances through the air, seems to the writer as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any physical fact to be." Soon after airplanes began to fly, another renowned astronomer, William H.

means. The modern technology that helps liberate information from political controls and impediments of time and place also tends to raise the value of old-fashioned judgment. The kind of insight that helps discern what is important and true from the mountain of facts and fantasies is growing in value almost daily. This is true for at least three reasons: 1. The very glut of information now available puts a premium on brevity. Brevity leads to abbreviation. Abbreviation leaves out what is unfamiliar. When you have many facts to digest and lots of phone calls to return, the natural desire is to make each information-processing event as concise as possible. Unfortunately, abbreviated information often provides a poor foundation for understanding. The deeper and richer textures of history are precisely the parts that tend to be edited out in the twenty-five-second sound-bites and misconstrued on CNN. It is much easier to convey a message that is a variation on an already understood theme than it is to explore a new paradigm of understanding. You can report a baseball or a cricket score much more easily than you can explain how baseball or cricket is played and what it means. 2. Rapidly changing technology is undermining the megapolitical basis of social and economic organization. As a consequence, broad paradigmatic understanding, or unspoken theories about the way the world works, are being antiquated more quickly than in the past. This increases the importance of the broad overview and diminishes the value of individual "facts" of the kind that are readily available to almost anyone with an information retrieval system. 3. The growing tribalization and marginalization of life have had a stunting effect on discourse, and even on thinking. Many people have consequently gotten into the habit of shying away from conclusions that are obviously implied by the facts at their disposal. A recent psychological study disguised as a public opinion poll showed that members of individual occupational groups were almost uniformly unwilling to accept any conclusion that implied a loss of income for them, no matter how airtight the logic supporting it. Given increased specialization, most of the interpretive information about most specialized occupational groups is designed to cater to the interests of the groups themselves. They have little interest in views that might be impolite, unprofitable, or politically incorrect. There is no better example of this general tendency than the broad drumbeat of views implying bright prospects for investing in the stock market. Most of that information is generated by brokerage firms, few of which will tell you that stocks are overvalued. Their income is derived from transaction business that depends on the majority of customers being ready to buy. Independent, contrary voices are seldom heard.

Of the quartet of laws intended to silence dissent, the Sedition Act proved the most pernicious; indictments were brought against Republican editors based on flimsy, trumped-up charges. Some people were hauled into court for the heinous crime of setting up a liberty pole with the banner: “No Stamp Act; no Sedition, no Alien-Bill; no Land Tax; Downfall to the Tyrants of America; Peace and Retirement to the President.”32 One Republican editor made the mistake of calling Hamilton’s projected army a “standing army” and paid a steep price: a two-hundred-dollar fine plus two months in prison, where he could ponder his linguistic error. Another editor earned eighteen months behind bars for daring to print the heresy that the government allowed the wealthy to benefit at the expense of commoners. Congressman Matthew Lyon of Vermont got four months in jail for criticizing the president’s “unbounded thirst for ridiculous pomp, foolish adulation, and selfish avarice.”33 The most outlandish case involved the prosecution of Luther Baldwin of New Jersey, who, under the spell of strong drink, wished that the ceremonial cannon fire greeting President Adams had landed in his backside. Five of the six most influential Republican papers were ultimately prosecuted under the new laws by a Federalist-dominated judiciary.

Later in the twentieth century, when the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) developed the insured amortized mortgage as a way to promote homeownership nationwide, these zoning practices rendered African Americans ineligible for such mortgages because banks and the FHA considered the existence of nearby rooming houses, commercial development, or industry to create risk to the property value of single-family areas. Without such mortgages, the effective cost of African American housing was greater than that of similar housing in white neighborhoods, leaving owners

In 1921 President Warren G. Harding’s secretary of commerce, Herbert Hoover, organized an Advisory Committee on Zoning to develop a manual explaining why every municipality should develop a zoning ordinance. The advisory committee distributed thousands of copies to officials nationwide. A few months later the committee published a model zoning law. The manual did not give the creation of racially homogenous neighborhoods as the reason why zoning should become such an important priority for cities, but the advisory committee was composed of outspoken segregationists whose speeches and writings demonstrated that race was one basis of their zoning advocacy.

To guide their work, the FHA provided them with an Underwriting Manual. The first, issued in 1935, gave this instruction: “If a neighborhood is to retain stability it is necessary that properties shall continue to be occupied by the same social and racial classes. A change in social or racial occupancy generally leads to instability and a reduction in values.” Appraisers were told to give higher ratings where “[p]rotection against some adverse influences is obtained,” and that “[i]mportant among adverse influences . . . are infiltration of inharmonious racial or nationality groups.” The manual concluded that “[a]ll mortgages on properties protected against [such] unfavorable influences, to the extent such protection is possible, will obtain a high rating.” The FHA discouraged banks from

AFTER WORLD War II, the newly established VA also began to guarantee mortgages for returning servicemen. It adopted FHA housing policies, and VA appraisers relied on the FHA’s Underwriting Manual. By 1950, the FHA and VA together were insuring half of all new mortgages nationwide. The FHA had its biggest impact on segregation, not in its discriminatory evaluations of individual mortgage applicants, but in its financing of entire subdivisions, in many cases entire suburbs, as racially exclusive white enclaves.

A pattern emerges from these examples. Government’s commitment to separating residential areas by race began nationwide following the violent suppression of Reconstruction after 1877. Although the Supreme Court in 1917 forbade the first wave of policies—racial segregation by zoning ordinance—the federal government began to recommend ways that cities could evade that ruling, not only in the southern and border states but across the country. In the 1920s a Harding administration committee promoted zoning ordinances that distinguished single-family from multifamily districts. Although government publications did not say it in as many words, committee members made little effort to hide that an important purpose was to prevent racial integration. Simultaneously, and through the 1920s and the Hoover administration, the government conducted a propaganda campaign directed at white middle-class families to persuade them to move out of apartments and into single-family dwellings. During the 1930s the Roosevelt administration created maps of every metropolitan area, divided into zones of foreclosure risk based in part on the race of their occupants. The administration then insured white homeowners’ mortgages if they lived in all-white neighborhoods into which there was little danger of African Americans moving. After World War II the federal government went further and spurred the suburbanization of every metropolitan area by guaranteeing bank loans to mass-production builders who would create the all-white subdivisions that came to ring American cities. In 1973, the U.S. Commission

So increasingly in the twentieth century, racial covenants took the form of a contract among all owners in a neighborhood. Under these conditions, a neighbor could sue if an African American family made a purchase. Sometimes owners created such contracts and persuaded all or most of their neighbors to sign. But this was also not fully satisfactory, because anyone who didn’t sign might sell to an African American with little fear of being successfully sued. To get around this problem, many subdivision developers created a community association before putting homes up for initial sale, and they made membership in it a condition of purchase. Association bylaws usually included a whites-only clause. In

The 1936 manual summarized instructions to appraisers like this: 284 (2). Carefully compiled zoning regulations are the most effective because they not only exercise control over the subject property but also over the surrounding area. However, they are seldom complete enough to assure a homogeneous and harmonious neighborhood. 284 (3). Recorded deed restrictions should strengthen and supplement zoning ordinances. . . . Recommended restrictions include . . . [p]rohibition of the occupancy of properties except by the race for which they are intended [and a]ppropriate provisions for enforcement.

But when the builder’s intent to sell both to blacks and whites became known, the Santa Clara Board of Supervisors rezoned the site from residential to industrial use. When he found a second plot, Mountain View officials told him that they would never grant the necessary approvals. He next identified a third tract of land in another town near the Ford plant; when officials discovered that the project would not be segregated, the town adopted a new zoning law increasing the minimum lot size from 6,000 to 8,000 square feet, making the project unfeasible for working-class buyers.

Teachers and schools tend to mistake good behavior for good character. What they prize above all else is docility, suggestibility; the child who will do what he is told; or even better, the child who will do what is wanted without even having to be told. They value most in children what children least value in themselves.

But even to those who like them most, children are not always a joy and delight to be with. Often they are much like older people, and often they are exasperating and irritating. It is not surprising that there are many adults who do not like children much, if at all. But they feel that they ought to like them, have a duty to like them, and they try to discharge this duty by acting, particularly by talking, as if they liked them. Hence the continual and meaningless use of words like honey, dearie, etc. Hence, the dreadful, syrupy voice that so many adults use when they speak to children. By the time they are ten, children are fed up with this fake affection, and ready to believe that, most of the time, adults believe and mean very little of what they say.

The more I see of our troublemaking Jane, and the more I think about her, the clearer it becomes that she has a great need to feel truly loved, but feels that being loved when she is nice, good, obedient, etc., does not count. Loved is a tricky word here; perhaps I should say admired, appreciated, or even honored and respected. She is like Cyrano; she thinks nothing could be more contemptible than to try to get approval and affection from others by saying, doing, and being what they want.

Not only does the examination racket do harm by making students feel that a search for honest understanding is beside the point; it does further harm by discouraging those few students who go on making that search in spite of everything. The student who will not be satisfied merely to know "right answers" or recipes for getting them will not have an easy time in school, particularly since facts and recipes may be all that his teachers know. They tend to be impatient or even angry with the student who wants to know, not just what happened, but why it happened as it did and not some other way. They rarely have the knowledge to answer such questions, and even more rarely have the time; there is all that material to cover.

In short, our "Tell-'em-and-test-'em" way of teaching leaves most students increasingly confused, aware that their academic success rests on shaky foundations, and convinced that school is mainly a place where you follow meaningless procedures to get meaningless answers to meaningless questions.

Worse yet, we are not honest about ourselves, our own fears, limitations, weaknesses, prejudices, motives. We present ourselves to children as if we were gods, all-knowing, all-powerful, always rational, always just, always right. This is worse than any lie we could tell about ourselves. I have more than once shocked teachers by telling them that when kids ask me a question to which I don't know the answer, I say, "I haven't the faintest idea"; or

In a discussion of this in a class of teachers, I once said that I liked some of the kids in my class much more than others and that, without saying which ones I liked best, I had told them so. After all, this is something that children know, whatever we tell them; it is futile to lie about it. Naturally, these teachers were horrified. "What a terrible thing to say!" one said. "I love all the children in my class exactly the same." Nonsense; a teacher who says this is lying, to herself or to others, and probably doesn't like any of the children very much. Not that there is anything wrong with that; plenty of adults don't like children, and there is no reason why they should. But the trouble is they feel they should, which makes them feel guilty, which makes them feel resentful, which in turn makes them try to work off their guilt with indulgence and their resentment with subtle cruelties- cruelties of a kind that can be seen in many classrooms. Above all, it makes them put on the phony, syrupy, sickening voice and manner, and the fake smiles and forced, bright laughter that children see so much of in school, and rightly resent and hate.

When judged, what you have done will be taken into account. Your fate, ultimately, will be determined by your actions in life.” “You’re saying that if I don’t work for you, I’ll just have to accept what comes?” “I am saying that you cannot escape the consequences of your choices,” he said. I frowned at him for a minute. Then I said, “If I get on the train, it might just carry me straight to Hell.” “I can’t talk to you about that,” he said. “What comes next is about faith, Harry.

Perhaps God is correcting you for a fault, and if so, it befits you to be patient. It may be your friend had more of your love than God did, and therefore God took away such a relation, so that the stream of your love might run back to him again

Secondly, there is an incomplete obedience which is accepted in Christ. This consists in four things: (1) An approving of all God’s commands: “the commandment is holy and just and good . . . I consent unto the law that it is good” (Romans 7:12, 16). There is both assent and consent. (2) A sweet delight in God’s commands: “I will delight myself in your commandments, which I have loved” (Psalm 119:47). (3) A cordial desire to walk in all God’s commands: “O that my ways were directed to keep your statutes” (Psalm 119:5). (4) A real endeavor to tread in every path of the command: “I turned my feet unto your testimonies” (Psalm 119:59). This, God esteems perfect obedience—and is pleased to take it in good part.

the LORD commanded Moses. nu15v37 Tassels on Garments nu15v38 nu15v39 nu15v40 nu15v41 37The LORD said to Moses, 38“Speak to the people of Israel, and tell them to d make tassels on the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and to put a cord of blue on the tassel of each corner. 39And it shall be a tassel for you to look at and remember all the commandments of the LORD, to do them, e not to follow [5] after your own heart and your own eyes, which you are inclined f to whore after. 40So you shall remember and do all my commandments, and be g holy to your God. 41 h I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God: I am the LORD your God.” nu16v1 Korah’s Rebellion nu16v2 nu16v3 nu16v4 nu16v5 nu16v6 nu16v7 nu16v8 nu16v9 nu16v10 nu16v11 NUMBERS 16 Now i Korah the son of Izhar, son of Kohath, son of Levi, and j Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, and On the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men. 2And they rose up before Moses, with a number of the people of Israel, 250 chiefs of the congregation, chosen from the assembly, well-known men. 3 k They assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron and said to them, l “You have gone too far! For m all in the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them. Why then do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of the LORD?” 4When Moses heard it, n he fell on his face, 5and he said to Korah and all his company, “In the morning the LORD will show o who is his, [1] and who is p holy, and will bring him near to him. The one q whom he chooses he will r bring near to him. 6Do this: take s censers, Korah and all his company; 7put fire in them and put incense on them before the LORD tomorrow, and the man whom the LORD chooses shall be the holy one. t You have gone too far, sons of Levi!” 8And Moses said to Korah, “Hear now, you sons of Levi: 9is it u too small a thing for you that the God of Israel has v separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do service in the tabernacle of the LORD and to stand before the congregation to minister to them, 10and that he has brought you near him, and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you? And would you seek the priesthood also? 11Therefore it is against the LORD that you and all your company have gathered together. What is w Aaron that you grumble against him?” nu16v12 nu16v13 nu16v14 nu16v15 12And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, and they said, “We will not come up. 13Is it x a small thing that you have brought us up out of y a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, that you must also z make yourself a prince over us? 14Moreover, you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up.” 15And Moses was very angry and said to the LORD, a “Do not respect their offering. b I have not taken one donkey from them, and I have not harmed one of them.” nu16v16 nu16v17 nu16v18 nu16v19 16And Moses said to Korah, “Be present, you and all your company, c before the LORD, you and they, and Aaron, tomorrow. 17And d let every one of you take his censer and put incense on it, and every one of you bring before the LORD his censer, e 250 censers; you also, and Aaron, each his censer.” 18So every man took his censer and put fire in them and laid incense on them and stood at the entrance of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron. 19Then Korah assembled all the congregation against them at the entrance of the tent of meeting. f And the glory of the LORD appeared to all the congregation. nu16v20 nu16v21 nu16v22 nu16v23 nu16v24 20And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, 21 g “Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them h in a moment.” 22And they i fell on their faces and said, “O God, j the God of the spirits of all flesh, k shall one man sin, and will you be angry with all the congregation?” 23And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 24“Say to the congregation, Get away from the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.” nu16v25 nu16v26 nu16v27 nu16v28 nu16v29 nu16v30 25Then Moses rose and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him. 26And he spoke to the congregation, saying, l “Depart, please, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be swept away with all their sins.” 27So they got away from the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. And Dathan and Abiram came out and stood m at the door of their tents, together with their wives, their sons, and their little ones. 28And Moses said, “Hereby you shall know that the LORD has sent me to do all these works, and that it has not been n of my own accord. 29If these men die as all men die, or if they are visited by the fate of all mankind, o then the LORD has not sent me. 30But if the LORD creates something new, and p the ground opens its mouth and swallows them up with all that belongs to them, and they q go down alive into Sheol, then you shall know that these men have despised the LORD.” nu16v31 nu16v32 nu16v33 nu16v34 nu16v35 31 r And as soon as he had finished speaking all these words, the ground under them split apart. 32And the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households and s all the people who belonged to Korah and all their goods. 33So they and all that belonged to them went down alive into Sheol, and the earth closed over them, and t they perished from the midst of the assembly. 34And all Israel who were around them fled at their cry, for they said, “Lest the earth swallow us up!” 35And u fire came out from the LORD and consumed v the 250 men offering the incense. nu16v36 nu16v37 nu16v38 nu16v39 nu16v40 36 [2] Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 37“Tell Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest to take up the censers out of the blaze. Then scatter the fire far and wide, for they have become holy. 38As for the censers of w these men who have sinned at the cost of their lives, let them be made into hammered plates as a covering for the altar, for they offered them before the LORD, and they became holy. x Thus they shall be a sign to the people of Israel.” 39So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers, which those who were burned had offered, and they were hammered out as a covering for the altar, 40to be a reminder to the people of Israel, so y that no outsider, who is not of the descendants of Aaron, should draw near to burn incense before the LORD, lest he become like Korah and his company—as the LORD said to him through Moses. nu16v41 nu16v42 nu16v43 nu16v44 nu16v45 nu16v46 nu16v47 nu16v48 nu16v49 nu16v50 41But on the next day all the congregation of the people of Israel z grumbled against Moses and against Aaron, saying, “You have killed the people of the LORD.” 42And when the congregation had assembled against Moses and against Aaron, they turned toward the tent of meeting. And behold, a the cloud covered it, and b the glory of the LORD appeared. 43And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting, 44and the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 45 c “Get away from the midst of this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.” d And they fell on their faces. 46And Moses said to Aaron, “Take your censer, and put fire on it from off the altar and lay incense on it and carry it quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them, for e wrath has gone out from the LORD; the plague has begun.” 47So Aaron took it as Moses said and ran into the midst of the assembly. And behold, the plague had already begun among the people. And he put on the incense and made atonement for the people. 48And he stood between the dead and the living, and f the plague was stopped. 49Now those who died in the plague were 14,700, g besides those who died in the affair of Korah. 50And Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the tent of meeting, when the plague was stopped. nu17v1 Aaron’s Staff Buds nu17v2 nu17v3 nu17v4 nu17v5 nu17v6 nu17v7 NUMBERS 17 [1] The LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2 h “Speak to the people of Israel, and get from them staffs, one for each fathers’ house, from all their chiefs according to their fathers’ houses, twelve staffs. Write each man’s name on his staff, 3and write Aaron’s name on the staff of Levi. For there shall be one staff for the head of each fathers’ house. 4Then you shall deposit them in the tent of meeting before the testimony, i where I meet with you. 5And the staff of the man j whom I choose shall sprout. Thus I will make to cease from me k the grumblings of the people of Israel, which they grumble against you.” 6Moses spoke to the people of Israel. And all their chiefs gave him staffs, one for each chief, according to their fathers’ houses, twelve staffs. And the staff of Aaron was among their staffs. 7And Moses deposited the staffs before the LORD in l the tent of the testimony. nu17v8 nu17v9 nu17v10 nu17v11 8On the next day Moses went into the tent of the testimony, and behold, the staff of Aaron for the house of Levi had sprouted and put forth buds and produced blossoms, and it bore ripe almonds. 9Then Moses brought out all the staffs from before the LORD to all the people of Israel. And they looked, and each man took his staff. 10And the LORD said to Moses, “Put back m the staff of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept n as a sign for the rebels, o that you may make an end of their grumblings against me, lest they die.” 11Thus did Moses; as the LORD commanded him, so he did. nu17v12 nu17v13 12And the people of Israel said to Moses, “Behold, we perish, we are undone, we are all undone. 13 p Everyone who comes near, who comes near to the tabernacle of the LORD, shall die. Are we all to perish?” nu18v1 Duties of Priests and Levites nu18v2 nu18v3 nu18v4 nu18v5 nu18v6 nu18v7 NUMBERS 18 So the LORD said to Aaron, “You and your sons and your father’s house with you shall q bear iniquity connected with the sanctuary, r and you and your sons with you shall bear iniquity connected with your priesthood. 2And with you bring your brothers also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, that they may s join you and t minister to you while you and your sons with you are before the tent of the testimony. 3They shall keep guard over you and u over the whole tent, v but shall not come near to the vessels of the sanctuary or to the altar w lest they, and you, die. 4They shall join you and keep guard over the tent of meeting for all the service of the tent, x and no outsider shall come near you. 5And you shall y keep guard over the sanctuary and over the altar, z that there may never again be wrath on the people of Israel. 6 a And behold, I have taken your brothers the Levites from among the people of Israel. b They are a gift to you, given to the LORD, to do the service of the tent of meeting. 7And c you and your sons with you shall guard your priesthood for all that concerns the altar and d that is within the veil; and you shall serve. I give your priesthood as a gift, [1] and e any outsider who comes near shall be put to death.” nu18v8 nu18v9 nu18v10 nu18v11 nu18v12 nu18v13 nu18v14 nu18v15 nu18v16 nu18v17 nu18v18 nu18v19 nu18v20 8Then the LORD spoke to Aaron, “Behold, f I have given you charge of the contributions made to me, all the consecrated things of the people of Israel. I have given them to you g as a portion and to your sons as a perpetual due. 9This shall be yours of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every offering of theirs, every grain offering of theirs and every h sin offering of theirs and every i guilt offering of theirs, which they render to me, shall be most holy to you and to your sons. 10In a most holy place shall you eat it. Every male may eat it; it is holy to you. 11This also is yours: the contribution of their gift, all the j wave offerings of the people of Israel. I have given them to k you, and to your sons and daughters with you, as a perpetual due. l Everyone who is clean in your house may eat it. 12 m All the best of the oil and all the best of the wine and of the grain, n the firstfruits of what they give to the LORD, I give to you. 13The first ripe fruits of all that is in their land, o which they bring to the LORD, shall be yours. l Everyone who is clean in your house may eat it. 14 p Every devoted thing in Israel shall be yours. 15 q Everything that opens the womb of all flesh, whether man or beast, which they offer to the LORD, shall be yours. Nevertheless, r the firstborn of man you shall redeem, and the firstborn of unclean animals you shall redeem. 16And their redemption price s (at a month old you shall redeem them) you shall fix at five shekels [2] in silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, t which is twenty gerahs. 17 u But the firstborn of a cow, or the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goat, you shall not redeem; they are holy. You shall sprinkle their blood on the altar and shall burn their fat as a food offering, with a pleasing aroma to the LORD. 18But their flesh shall be yours, as v the breast that is waved and as the right thigh are yours. 19 w All the holy contributions that the people of Israel present to the LORD I give to you, and to your sons and daughters with you, as a perpetual due. x It is a covenant of salt forever before the LORD for you and for your offspring with you.” 20And the LORD said to Aaron, “You shall have no inheritance in their land, neither shall you have any portion among them. y I am your portion and your inheritance among the people of Israel. nu18v21 nu18v22 nu18v23 nu18v24 21 z “To the Levites I have given every tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service that they do, their service in the tent of meeting, 22 a so that the people of Israel do not come near the tent of meeting, b lest they bear sin and die. 23But c the Levites shall do the service of the tent of meeting, d and they shall bear their iniquity. It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations, and among the people of Israel they shall have no inheritance. 24For the tithe of the people of Israel, which e they present as a contribution to the LORD, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance. Therefore I have said of them that they shall have no inheritance f among the people of Israel.” nu18v25 nu18v26 nu18v27 nu18v28 nu18v29 nu18v30 nu18v31 nu18v32 25And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 26“Moreover, you shall speak and say to the Levites, ‘When you take from the people of Israel the tithe that I have given you from them for your inheritance, then you shall present a contribution from it to the LORD, g a tithe of the tithe. 27 h And your contribution shall be counted to you as though it were the grain of the threshing floor, and as the fullness of the winepress. 28So you shall also present a contribution to the LORD from all your tithes, which you receive from the people of Israel. And from it you shall give the LORD’s contribution to Aaron the priest. 29Out of all the gifts to you, you shall present every contribution due to the LORD; from each its best part is to be dedicated.’ 30Therefore you shall say to them, ‘When you have offered from it the best of it, i then the rest shall be counted to the Levites as produce of the threshing floor, and as produce of the winepress. 31And you may eat it in any place, you and your households, for it is j your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting. 32And you shall k bear no sin by reason of it, when you have contributed the best of it. But you shall not l profane the holy things of the people of Israel, lest you die.’” nu19v1 Laws for Purification nu19v2 nu19v3 nu19v4 nu19v5 nu19v6 nu19v7 nu19v8 nu19v9 nu19v10 NUMBERS 19 Now the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, 2“This is the statute of the law that the LORD has commanded: Tell the people of Israel to bring you a red heifer without defect, in which there is no blemish, m and on which a yoke has never come. 3And you shall give it to Eleazar the priest, and n it shall be taken outside the camp and slaughtered before him. 4And Eleazar the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger, and o sprinkle some of its blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times. 5And the heifer shall be burned in his sight. p Its skin, its flesh, and its blood, with its dung, shall be burned. 6And the priest shall take q cedarwood and hyssop and scarlet yarn, and throw them into the fire burning the heifer. 7Then the priest r shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward he may come into the camp. But the priest shall be unclean until evening. 8 s The one who burns the heifer r shall wash his clothes in water and bathe his body in water and shall be unclean until evening. 9And a man who is clean shall gather up t the ashes of the heifer and deposit them outside the camp in a u clean place. And they shall be kept for the water for v impurity for the congregation of the people of Israel; it is a sin offering. 10And the one who gathers the ashes of the heifer r shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening. And this shall be a perpetual statute for the people of Israel, and for the stranger who sojourns among them. nu19v11 nu19v12 nu19v13 11 w “Whoever touches the dead body of any person shall be unclean seven days. 12He x shall cleanse himself with the water on the third day and on the seventh day, and so be clean. But if he does not cleanse himself on the third day and on the seventh day, he will not become clean. 13Whoever touches a dead person, the body of anyone who has died, and does not cleanse himself, y defiles the tabernacle of the LORD, z and that person shall be cut off from Israel; because the water for impurity was not thrown on him, he shall be unclean. His uncleanness is still on him. nu19v14 nu19v15 nu19v16 nu19v17 nu19v18 nu19v19 14“This is the law when someone dies in a tent: everyone who comes into the tent and everyone who is in the tent shall be unclean seven days.

The IMF, it must be noted, is staffed primarily with holders of Ph.D.s in economics from American universities, who are both illiterate about and contemptuous of cultures that do not conform to what they call the “American way of life.” They offer only “one size (or, rather, one capitalism) fits all” remedies for ailing economic institutions. The IMF has applied these over the years to countries in Latin America, Russia, and East Asia without ever achieving a single notable success. Nonetheless,

alternative is better is perceived as a personal failure. Barriers are therefore raised to protect the ego and avoid a change of perceptions. This is done by adopting one of the counterstrategies to the list above. The most common counter-arguments are that the barriers to the proposed behavior are too high: "I can't give up my car." The second most common counter arguments are that the benefits of the proposed behavior are too low: "I don't know what I'd do if I didn't have to go to work all day every day." The third most common is that the barriers to the competing behavior are low enough: "I'm already doing it this way--I got too much invested already." The fourth most common is that the benefits of the competing behavior are sufficiently high: "Although I'm miserable, at least I'm comfortable." This varies depending on who you are.

For more on CBT—how it works, and how to practice it—please see Appendix 1.) EMOTIONAL REASONING: Letting your feelings guide your interpretation of reality. “I feel depressed; therefore, my marriage is not working out.” CATASTROPHIZING: Focusing on the worst possible outcome and seeing it as most likely. “It would be terrible if I failed.” OVERGENERALIZING: Perceiving a global pattern of negatives on the basis of a single incident. “This generally happens to me. I seem to fail at a lot of things.” DICHOTOMOUS THINKING (also known variously as “black-and-white thinking,” “all-or-nothing thinking,” and “binary thinking”): Viewing events or people in all-or-nothing terms. “I get rejected by everyone,” or “It was a complete waste of time.” MIND READING: Assuming that you know what people think without having sufficient evidence of their thoughts. “He thinks I’m a loser.” LABELING: Assigning global negative traits to yourself or others (often in the service of dichotomous thinking). “I’m undesirable,” or “He’s a rotten person.” NEGATIVE FILTERING: You focus almost exclusively on the negatives and seldom notice the positives. “Look at all of the people who don’t like me.” DISCOUNTING POSITIVES: Claiming that the positive things you or others do are trivial, so that you can maintain a negative judgment. “That’s what wives are supposed to do—so it doesn’t count when she’s nice to me,” or “Those successes were easy, so they don’t matter.” BLAMING: Focusing on the other person as the source of your negative feelings; you refuse to take responsibility for changing yourself. “She’s to blame for the way I feel now,” or “My parents caused all my problems.”11

Paranoid parenting is a powerful way to teach kids all three of the Great Untruths. We convince children that the world is full of danger; evil lurks in the shadows, on the streets, and in public parks and restrooms. Kids raised in this way are emotionally prepared to embrace the Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people—a worldview that makes them fear and suspect strangers. We teach children to monitor themselves for the degree to which they “feel unsafe” and then talk about how unsafe they feel. They may come to believe that feeling “unsafe” (the feeling of being uncomfortable or anxious) is a reliable sign that they are unsafe (the Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings). Finally, feeling these emotions is unpleasant; therefore, children may conclude, the feelings are dangerous in and of themselves—stress will harm them if it doesn’t kill them (the Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker).

The violations of the code were easy to explain from an economic and cultural point of view. In the cities of newly independent Algeria, vacant lots facing a formal street were rare and expensive. The price of land was such that lots tended to be small in order to remain affordable. Traditional houses in the old medina of Tlemcen were designed around a central courtyard, while the building surrounding the courtyard occupied the entire lot up to the property lines. Because privacy was highly valued, there were few windows opening onto streets, and these windows were narrow and placed high on the walls to prevent any direct view from the street into the house. The applicants for building permits were trying to design a house as close as possible to their preferred model, but the regulations were designed to produce a suburban detached house like the ones found in the suburbs of Paris. The small size of the lots the applicants could afford combined with the generous setbacks demanded by the regulations made the floor size of the prospective house much smaller than they would have been if regulations had allowed them to build a house, with a central courtyard, that occupied the entire lot. In addition, the requirement of large windows opening onto the streets was a direct violation of their cultural norms.

I reluctantly signed the letters prepared by my administrative assistant, but with a guilty conscience. By enforcing the regulations, I was forcing on local people an inadequate design and an inefficient use of scarce land in the name of abstract norms established long ago in a distant land with a different climate and culture.

Some readers might think that I may have been an exceptionally ignorant urban planner. I do not think that I was exceptional: I was rather typical in my ignorance. In the planning profession, high land prices are often deplored but are usually thought to be caused by speculators. To this day, few planners make a connection between land prices and rents, and the supply of land and floor space. That is why planners who design regulations that severely limit the extension of cities (e.g., through measures such as green-belts, designations between urban and agricultural land, etc. explored in chapter 4) are often surprised by increasing land prices and attribute them to external factors for which they were not responsible.

Failure to manage urban transportation in a manner that maintains mobility results in congestion. Congestion decreases labor mobility and productivity and is in fact avoidable in large cities. Its presence represents a failure on the part of city managers. Congestion has a dual negative effect: It acts as a tax on productivity by tying down people and goods, and it degrades the environment and increases greenhouse gas emissions. It

Unfortunately, well-intentioned regulations often prevent the poor from making these trade-offs between floor space consumption and location. Urban regulations typically require a “generous” minimum floor space standard for housing. These well-intentioned regulations exclude the poor because the high price of floor area makes it too expensive for them to afford the minimum standard. In Paris, chambres de bonne exist only in housing built before 1930; they are prohibited in apartment buildings that are more recent. These unfortunate regulations reduce the mobility of the poor. As a consequence, their participation in the full labor market is also restricted. In

In South Africa, the government housing program for the poor illustrates how well-intentioned planners may limit residents’ mobility, reduce their participation in the labor market, and increase their travel time. Starting in 1995, the government embarked on a massive housing program to improve the living conditions of the victims of apartheid. The program aimed to provide subsidized housing to about 80 percent of the poorest South Africans. By 2012, it had already delivered 3.5 million urban dwelling units, a unique quantitative achievement for a government housing program. The standards are generous: 400 square meters per lot, 65 square meters of floor space per house, wide vehicular access roads, and schools equipped with large sports grounds and within walking distance, among other things. The space standards are fixed and similar all over urban South Africa. The subsidy is also fixed, amounting to about 150,000 rand (US$16,000) per dwelling in 2012. The only dependent variable is the price of land. Land for this massive program must be very cheap to allow beneficiaries to enjoy the high space standards prescribed by the program. As a result, the new subsidized housing projects are all located in the far periphery of cities, in settlements that are too dispersed to be easily serviced by public transport. Because of the remote location, the beneficiaries of these projects have a hard time finding employment. Those who are employed pay as much as 50 percent of their income on transport, even when sharing taxis with other commuters. This dramatic example illustrates why planners should not make trade-off decisions involving location and land consumption for households and firms. In the case of South Africa, the

In the case of South Africa, the outcome is indeed comfortable housing for poor people, but the large subsidy attached to a house in a distant location prevents the beneficiaries from participating in the labor market. High-standard housing provided to poor people in a remote location becomes a poverty trap. The subsidies are not to blame here. The error is not only tying the subsidy to a specific location but also deciding on the location versus land consumption trade-off without having solicited input from the beneficiaries. A portable subsidy—that is, a lump sum given to poor households to use for shelter anywhere in the metropolitan area—is significantly preferable.

The spatial expansion of cities requires land, but the final product of urbanization is floor space, not land. Because land is an indispensable input for the building of floor space, a high demand for floor space in a specific location increases the price of land at this location. Floor space is the sum of the area built on land, whether public or private. In areas where the price of land is high, developers can decrease the area of land they use to produce a given area of floor space by building taller buildings. As a result, the quantity of land required to build a unit of floor space varies greatly in and across cities, reflecting the large variations in the spatial distribution of land prices set by the market. For instance, the Shanghai World Financial Center, a spectacular office tower built in Pudong, Shanghai’s new financial district, has 101 floors with a total floor space area of 377,000 square meters. This office tower was built on a lot measuring 27,800 square meters. The ratio of floor to land (also called the floor area ratio, or FAR) is therefore about 13.5. In other words, to build the Shanghai World Financial Center tower, the developer used only 1 square meter of land to build 13.5 square meters of floor space. By contrast, in Huaxinzhou, a suburb of Shanghai located 24 kilometers from the SWFC, a developer building single-family houses used as much as 1,350 square meters of land to build 300 square meters of floor space; this corresponds to a FAR of 0.22. Thus in Shanghai, building 1 square meter of floor space in Huaxinzhou occupies about 61 times more land than in Pudong! The

location. Tall buildings are more expensive to build per unit of floor space than are shorter buildings, but the potential higher sale price by unit of floor space due to high demand compensates for the higher construction cost. The higher FAR values lower the cost of land per unit of floor space sold. A high or low FAR is therefore not a design parameter. The FAR captures the conversion from land to capital in providing floor space. It is purely an economic decision depending on the price of land in relation to the price of construction. If the price of land is much lower than the price of construction, there is not much reason to construct buildings taller than two or three floors. For instance, in Glen Rock, the New York suburb mentioned above, the cost of land is about $450/m2, and the construction cost of a typical wooden frame home is about $1,600/m2. Therefore, there is not much incentive to substitute capital for land, and as a result, the FAR of most houses is low, about 0.25. By contrast, in New York’s Midtown area, the price of land is about $25,000/m2, and the construction cost of a prime office building is roughly $5,000/m2, only 20 percent of the price of land. The high cost of land in Midtown significantly increases the incentive to substitute capital for land and thus explains why the FAR of office buildings is about 15. As in Pudong, the existence of tall buildings in Midtown New York does not reflect a design choice but an economic necessity imposed by markets and reflecting high consumers’ demand for this location. Some urban planners may disagree with me and argue that the existence of tall buildings is mainly the result of a design decision imposed by zoning plans, which fix maximum FAR values through regulation. Here is why they may hold this mistaken notion. In most cities, planners strictly regulate FAR values, because they assume that tall buildings impose large negative externalities on the surrounding neighborhood. Tall buildings indeed cast long shadows and may create congestion in adjacent streets because of the large number of people who are likely to live or work in them. In many cities, because of FAR regulations, the height of buildings is constrained at much lower levels than market demand would suggest. In areas where maximum regulatory FARs are much lower than demand for floor space suggests, most buildings are likely to make full use of the limited FAR permitted by regulations. Eventually, the city’s planners may decide to increase the value of the regulatory FAR over the one currently allowed. Developers will then make use of the entire, newly permitted FAR value and will, therefore, build taller buildings. The timing correlation between the increase in regulatory FAR and the construction of taller buildings gives an illusion of causality between regulations and tall buildings. Consequently, some planners think that fixing a FAR regulatory value is a design decision and that new buildings will automatically use the entire FAR value set by regulations. While this may be true in areas where demand for floor space was previously constrained by regulations, increasing the regulatory FAR value where no demand for taller buildings exists would have no effect on the height of future buildings. In Glen Rock, the New York suburban area mentioned above, the FAR value used in most buildings varies from 0.2 to 0.3, while the maximum permitted FAR is about 0.4. There is not much demand now for the floor space allowed by the current FAR regulations. If planners were to authorize a FAR value of, say, 5, no tall buildings would be constructed following the zoning change. Markets React to Exogenous Factors That Planners Cannot Anticipate Changing exogenous forces are constantly modifying the market’s equilibrium, and as a result, urban shapes and land uses created by the market constantly evolve as well.

Responding to the disruptions caused by land use changes, local governments are often tempted to intervene in order to slow down the rate of change and prevent the recycling of obsolete land use by reducing the FAR, mandating commercial versus residential zoning, or freezing particular industrial land uses. However, the long-range effects of maintaining obsolete land use through regulations are disastrous for future employment levels and for the general welfare of urban dwellers. Preventing the transformation of obsolete land use also prevents new jobs from being created in its place. Regulations can prevent land use changes but cannot stop jobs from disappearing from the obsolete areas. A city’s labor market then shrinks when the government maintains land under a use for which there is no more demand. Freezing obsolete land use does not prevent Schumpeterian destruction, but it prevents the creation associated with it. “All that is solid melts into air,” but the destruction is not followed by any new creation.

Land Use Change: Mumbai The story of Mumbai’s cotton mills best illustrates the tragic consequences of freezing obsolete land uses in the hope of preserving jobs. Indian entrepreneurs built Mumbai’s first cotton mills in the middle of the nineteenth century in what was then an industrial suburb of Mumbai. In 1861, the American Civil War contributed to a large price increase for Indian cotton cloth (an external shock already occurring long before the spread of globalization). Consequently, the mills multiplied to employ, at their peak in the 1930s, more than 350,000 workers; they occupied an area of 280 hectares, not including worker housing. However, subsequent competition from other Asian countries and from more modern mills built in smaller Indian cities made the higher price of cotton fabric manufactured in Mumbai increasingly uncompetitive on the world market. Because of outside competition, some mills had to close. After World War II, more mills started closing, partly because as Mumbai developed, their locations in the middle of a dense and congested metropolis made them too expensive to operate. The productivity of the mills also kept decreasing: Given land expenses, no updates had been made to factories, making the factory layout and technology obsolete. A workers’ strike lasting more than a year in 1982 delivered the coup de grâce to Mumbai’s cotton mills. The story of the growth and decay of a textile industry is not unique to Mumbai; many European industrial cities, like Manchester and Ghent, went through the same cycles, produced by the same external forces. However, as the Mumbai mills were closing, the municipality and workers’ unions, fought to preserve the high taxes and the well-paying industrial jobs produced by the mills. As a result, they prevented mills’ owners from selling the potentially expensive land on which the now-deserted mills had been built. Later, when it became clear that the mills would never open again, the local government imposed such draconian conditions3 on the redevelopment of the land that it became frozen in court cases. As a consequence, over the course of more than 40 years, an increasing number of mills stood empty in the middle of Mumbai, obliging the city to expand its infrastructure farther north while by-passing the 280 hectares of already well-serviced area occupied by the empty mills (figure 3.1). In 2009, when some of the land formerly occupied by the mills was finally auctioned, the price reached more than US$2,200 per square meter! The total value of the mill land unused for about 30 years would be therefore around US$6 billion in 2009, or more than five times Mumbai’s capital budget for 2014.4

The users of urban roads seldom pay market rents for the road area they occupy6 while commuting; their transport cost is therefore subsidized by the amount of rent they are not paying for using the roads. Users of the standard urban model can then infer that the subsidy for the use of road space increases the built-up area of the city by an area that can eventually be calculated. Pricing the use of roads through tolls could eventually restore land consumption to an optimum level. Using market mechanisms to improve land use efficiency would achieve better results than trying to design regulations to obtain the same results.

Informal development is a market response to the design rigidity imposed by regulations. Informal land development introduces a form of land supply elasticity in cities where the effects of regulations on markets significantly decrease the land supply (x2 is smaller than x1). In the absence of new informal developments, the increase in the supply of housing units for low-income households can happen only through the densification of existing low-income neighborhoods, which reduces the amount of land and floor space that low-income households consume. Therefore, the enforcement of urban planning rules frequently contributes to lowering the quality and quantity of housing affordable to the poor (as explained in depth in chapter 6). The

An understanding of the standard urban model is indispensable when making informed choices to manage cities. Let us summarize the operational implications of the spatial distribution of prices and densities as derived from the model. Concerns about the overconsumption of land by cities (“sprawl”) are best addressed by identifying possible distortions in the land market, caused by abusing the use of eminent domain, underpricing agricultural land, and subsidizing gasoline. Setting arbitrary spatial barriers to urban expansion, such as green-belts and UGBs, however, results in higher land and housing prices, longer commute times, and other negative outcomes as demonstrated in Hanoi’s master plan. Land prices and population densities are closely related and are produced by market forces. We have also seen that there is no optimum density for urban development, and within the same city, densities may vary by orders of magnitude from the center to the periphery. The population density in a particular neighborhood is determined by trade-offs between households’ desire to consume more land and floor space and the commuting cost in time and money. Households with different preferences and incomes make different trade-offs. Some low-income households prefer to reduce drastically their land and floor space consumption in order to reduce commuting costs. Other households with similar incomes may make different trade-offs. Planners cannot possibly know the reasons households may have for selecting a specific housing location and level of land consumption. Therefore, planners should abstain from arbitrarily fixing densities through regulations. Neither should they try to distribute population according to a designed spatial pattern, no matter how clever the geometric arrangement appears to be.

Planners should use the standard urban model to better understand how markets work in the city they are managing. They can use the model to anticipate the effect of regulations and infrastructure on land prices and rents. They can plan, finance, and build the infrastructure that would increase the supply of land and therefore decrease housing costs. They can design transport systems that decrease commuting time and cost, another way of increasing the supply of land and increasing mobility. They should design transport systems that are consistent with the densities set by the land markets rather than design densities that would make a preselected transport system feasible.

Unaffordable housing is a plague affecting many large cities. Monitoring the ratio between median income and median housing price allows us to constantly measure housing affordability. When the price-to-income ratio becomes higher than 4, planners should take immediate action. This action could be to increase land supply through new infrastructure development or to audit land use regulations and building permit practices that may make developed land and housing prices artificially high. Urban planners should be held responsible for unaffordable high price/income ratios in the same way that public health officials are held responsible for infectious disease epidemics, or police are held responsible for high crime.

On a typical street in Manhattan, parked cars are using 44 percent of the street area available to vehicles (not including sidewalks). Given the scarcity of road space, transferring all on-street parking to privately operated underground garages would greatly increase city mobility, the safety of pedestrians, and the pleasantness of a city in general. The political feasibility of doing so is remote, as many users of free or quasi-free on-street parking consider it as a basic human right. Any mayor attempting to improve mobility for pedestrians, surface public transport, and cars by removing on-street parking would probably not be reelected or might even be impeached.

Setting minimum housing standards is a political act. Governments tend to select high standards as an optimistic signal for the future of the city, the sort of optimistic projection that politicians are all obliged to make. Statisticians then compare the standards of the existing urban housing stock (obtained through surveys and the census) with the national minimum housing norm established by the government. The number of existing dwelling units below the national housing norm is said to constitute a housing “backlog.” To eliminate this backlog, the government commits itself to building enough housing units each year to clear the backlog. For example, South Africa created new housing stock for 38 percent of its citizens over a period of 17 years—a feat that we will investigate as a case study later in the chapter. Note that the housing program was defined only through two attributes: price and a physical housing standard. Location is absent from the policy, leading the South African government to build some homes as far as 30 kilometers from a city center.

How governments define housing affordability is therefore very important when developing housing programs to help the poor. Government bureaucrats tend to make different trade-offs than the households would make for themselves when choosing between price, location, area, and quality. If the trade-offs made by government differ a lot from those that households would make, then the housing program will fail despite the money invested and the good intentions of the expert designers. Urban planners do not have enough information to enable them to select an optimum combination of rent, floor area, and location for each household and firm. The choice of the quantity of land and floor area consumed in a specific location is therefore better left to the end user when possible.

High prices or absolute poverty force poorer households to consume less housing than the minimum socially acceptable level set by regulations, as mentioned above. Falling below this minimum will further decrease the housing standards of the poor. Consuming less housing than what is prescribed as socially acceptable often prevents their housing from attaining legal status and permanence. This will compound their misery through a vicious cycle as poverty that causes low housing consumption which causes more poverty. In middle- and high-income

New York In New York, a 1987 city zoning regulation specified that the area of apartments should be at least 37.2 square meters. But the supply of apartments of this size is constrained by another zoning regulation that puts a maximum limit on the number of dwelling units per area, thus implicitly reducing the number of small apartments that could be built in a block, regardless of whether there is a demand for such apartments. However, the demand for small apartments has been increasing as the number of people per household has decreased over the past 50 years. In 2015, the number of nonfamily households (i.e., households formed by a single person or unrelated individuals) represented 38 percent of all households. Recognizing this problem, in 2015, the zoning board allowed the construction of 55 mini-apartments ranging from 24 to 33 square meters, in a single nine-story building on the East Side of Manhattan. This was a timid step toward using a commonsense approach to repeal minimum socially acceptable standards. When the 55 mini-apartments appeared on the market, there were 4,300 applicants for each apartment! This demonstrated the large demand for small units, which is arbitrarily constrained by the regulation on minimum apartment size. The apartment building is centrally located with excellent access to New York’s labor market. Relaxing the minimum apartment size gave individuals the freedom to make their own choice in the trade-off between larger apartments in less central locations and centrally located smaller apartments.

residents. Many zoning regulations are established to prevent changes of any nature, including preventing lower-income families from living in middle-income neighborhoods. In the case of the Bangladeshi migrants, they outbid their more affluent neighbors by consuming less floor space than the existing residents. It is the opposite of gentrification. While the city planning department claims social inclusion (i.e., neighborhoods with mixed household incomes) as its objective, it prevents the emergence of mixed-income neighborhoods by creating zoning laws that block lower-income households from being able to afford to live in higher-income neighborhoods.

In the absence of new supply, higher-income groups will outbid the lower-income group to occupy the only new units on the markets. The trickle down will then become a trickle up. Trickle up means that housing units previously affordable to lower-income households are being bought by upper-income groups (gentrification). This happens quite often in government-subsidized housing when the overall housing market is heavily constrained by land use regulations or the lack of infrastructure expansion, which constrains land supply. Higher-income groups then “invade” the housing stock of the lower-income groups. The effect is particularly severe when higher-income groups acquire existing dwellings only to reassemble them into larger ones, thus decreasing the number of housing units in the entire stock.

Access to housing finance in the form of mortgages tends to increase the housing consumption of those who can qualify for them. Instead of relying entirely on their own savings to purchase a dwelling, households may borrow a part of the necessary sum from a bank. That allows them to buy a larger or better located house than if they were relying solely on their own savings. Households having access to mortgages may also buy additional dwelling units that they could rent out, thus significantly increasing the housing stock. The availability of mortgage finance therefore tends to increase the consumption of housing for those who qualify for it, as shown in figure 6.14. I

The first reaction of government is usually to set minimum housing standards, below which it will be illegal to build new housing. All the countries I worked in had minimum housing standards. New regulations then specify minimum housing consumption, usually expressed as a combination of minimum plot sizes, minimum floor areas, maximum densities and floor area ratio (FAR), in addition to minimum standards for road width and open space. Regulators pretend that preventing by law the construction of housing units deemed socially unacceptable will also prevent the crowding and unsanitary conditions in which low-income households are living. By regulating minimum housing consumption, governments are de facto trying to regulate their cities out of poverty. Regulating minimum housing consumption has the opposite effect. The minimum housing standards defined by regulations correspond to a minimum cost. When this cost is above what a certain number of households can possibly pay, the only effect of minimum housing consumption regulations is to render illegal those settlements that have been built below the new standards. In addition, the regulations expand into the future the extent of illegal settlements that are the only ones affordable to the poor. The inhabitants of illegal settlements

The regulations fixing minimum housing consumption are therefore not benign, even when they are not enforced—and usually they are largely unenforceable. Their only effect is to make more difficult the life of poor households living in settlements below the minimum standards. The people living in informal settlements are usually poor, and their poverty is further exacerbated by the very regulations that make their settlements informal.

For the poor, the costs of informality are high. First, informality implies an enhanced degree of tenure uncertainty, and therefore the possibility of demolition and expropriation without compensation. Second, many municipal services like water supply, storm drainage, and refuse disposal are often denied to informal settlements. Third, social services like health and education, if provided at all, are often substandard, because the informality of settlements implies an impermanency, and no government would invest in building schools or dispensaries in impermanent settlements.

Regulating minimum housing standards is not a technical task but a political act. In many cities in developing countries, but also in cities like New York and Paris, the minimum standards are unreasonably high. It seems that there is a minimum political cutoff value for housing standards. No local politician would approve a minimum standard value below this cutoff. Politicians feel that by accepting very low consumption standards, which may be the only one affordable to a part of the population, they somehow accept poverty as a permanent state, and that by setting high standards they are being progressive. Another even less benign explanation for the existence of unreasonably high housing standards is the desire to keep poor migrants out of cities and poor households out of specific neighborhoods. Many of the residential zoning laws in developed countries are designed to ensure a “homogenous” community—that is, to prevent people with lower incomes from moving into the neighborhood. What are the consequences of regulating minimum housing consumption values? People consume very little housing because they are too poor to afford more. The regulations will not lift the poor out of poverty. However, the regulations will prevent the construction of the only type of housing poor households can afford. If some developers are ready to continue building housing below the minimum standard, these houses will become illegal, exposing poor households to expulsion or to demolition of the only type of house they can afford. Regulations fixing minimum housing consumption thus deprive poor households of property rights.

If the shortcomings of supply side subsidies are so evident and well documented, why do so many municipal governments seem to prefer them to demand side subsidies? I suggest that politicians like to cut ribbons in front of tangible brick and mortar projects; they do not have this opportunity for demand side subsidies like vouchers. In addition, in many countries the large bureaucracy in charge of building public housing is a reliable source of patronage jobs and contracts. The assignment of subsidized units to beneficiaries also becomes a source of patronage that politicians find difficult to resist.

Finding a costless solution to providing affordable housing for the poor has been the Holy Grail of many governments. The goal is to appear to do something about an obvious social problem while not spending too much taxpayer money on it. Creative new housing regulations had been the approach most commonly used to find costless solutions to housing affordability. Having developers pay housing subsidies to poor households is the main objective of these creative regulations. These types of policies are politically attractive, as they appear generous to the poor without involving any apparent disbursement of taxpayer money. Developers are usually not a particularly popular social class and have the reputation of being rich. This is the ultimate Robin Hood approach: take from the rich to give to the poor.

In addition to the tax incentive, the developer who agrees to provide 20 percent of below-market-rent units receives a FAR bonus of about 20 percent on average. This means that if the current zoning allows a developer to build an area of floor space equivalent to 10 times the lot area (FAR = 10), under the incentive zoning, the developer will be able to build a floor area equal to 12 times the lot area (FAR = 12). This bonus FAR increase raises an interesting question. FARs are supposed to be limited by regulations because of the negative externalities that they might produce, for instance, casting shadows on other buildings, sidewalk overcrowding, or other problems. But the government practice of increasing FAR at will as an incentive for developers to do something that is deemed socially desirable demonstrates that the negative externality does not really exist, or at least is so low that it can be overlooked easily by urban planners when convenient. A government using regulatory constraints limiting FAR to negotiate with developers has a strong incentive to increase these constraints to the point of making development financially infeasible, so that developers are forced to negotiate with the city. By keeping FAR relatively low in areas where demand for floor space is high, the city creates an artificial shortage of floor space and contributes to the high price of housing. In areas where demand for floor space is much higher than the floor space allowed by the regulatory FAR, the city can then demand that developers provide for “free” something that the city wants. It might be a plaza, a park, or any amenity the city would like to have built. Under this system, the city acts like a monopolist on the supply of new floor space. It has an incentive to keep the supply of floor space low in order to keep the price of floor space high. Thus, it is ironic that the city feels obliged to increase regulatory pressure and thus makes housing more expensive for everybody in order to be able to produce a limited number of housing units below market price!

The above example of inclusionary zoning is not just an anecdotal illustration of a poorly designed housing policy. It represents a trend in many of the most economically successful cities in the world. The increasing regulatory frenzy that characterizes some cities like New York imposes large economic costs on the entire country. In a paper published in 2015, the economists Chang-Tai Hsieh and Enrico Moretti found that, between 1964 and 2009, the high cost of housing in some US cities relative to wages had lowered aggregate US GDP by 13.5 percent: Most of the loss was likely caused by increased constraints to housing supply in high productivity cities like New York, San Francisco and San Jose. Lowering regulatory constraints in these cities to the level of the median city would expand their work force and increase U.S. GDP by 9.5%.23

High housing prices are often due to constraints on the development of land and on the construction of floor space. In consumption sectors other than housing, the market usually responds adequately to demand coming from the wide range of income groups found in a city. This market response can be observed for the supply of clothing or food. Expensive designer clothing stores coexist with cheap or even second-hand clothing stores. In every city, shops supply designer shoes as well as cheap plastic sandals. The same can be observed for food: expensive and fast food restaurants are found side by side, while even cheaper meals can be bought from food carts. Fast food restaurants, catering to a wide range of incomes are even more likely to succeed than very expensive specialized restaurants. Why should housing be different from other consumption products? I believe that land development and the construction sectors are uniquely constrained by the regulations that restrict the availability of developable land and the construction of floor space. I am here talking only about regulations that prescribe a minimum consumption of land (like FAR, building height, or building footprint) and a minimum consumption of floor space (like minimum dwelling area). Sometimes these regulations are not binding. A regulation is not binding when the demand is lower than the maximum imposed by the regulation. For instance, if a regulation requires all buildings to be lower than five floors in an area where there is no demand for tall buildings, the regulation is not binding. All binding urban regulations increase the cost of housing—I insist: all binding regulations. Indeed, regulations always require builders to use more land than the market would require by fixing maximum FARs, maximum heights, and minimum lot sizes; and similarly to use more floor space by fixing minimum dwelling areas. Incredibly, regulations impose higher land consumption for consumers of housing, while at the same time they reduce the supply of developable land by putting arbitrary limits on city expansion (such as green-belts or urban growth boundaries). The result is predictably higher prices.

A New York Times’ article written in 2016 and relying on a detailed database notes that 40 percent of the existing buildings in Manhattan could not be built today because they contradict some land use zoning rules.15 Many of these buildings are clustered together in the most expensive parts of Manhattan. Therefore, not meeting land use regulations does not seem to decrease their value, which would tend to demonstrate that zoning rules do not correct any perceivable negative externalities.

Mayors and Urban Planners Should Be Enablers and Facilitators, Not the Creators or Shapers of Cities The productivity of cities comes from the proximity of households and firms. However, this close physical proximity, which is so essential to the creativity of cities, requires special rules, shared investments, and common services. Local governments are created specifically to set and enforce the rules that make proximity viable. In addition, local governments manage shared capital goods (e.g., infrastructure and public open space) and provide social services. Shared capital investment and services need to be paid for through local taxes, tolls, and user fees. The role of mayors and their municipal staff, including urban planners and economists, is therefore rather like the role of a well-coordinated team of competent managers and janitors. The mayor, with his team of municipal managers, is not the city’s ruler, nor is he the city’s designer. A city is entirely created by its citizens’ initiatives. These citizens are required to act within a set of “good neighbor” rules, and to be supported in their endeavors by a network of physical and social infrastructure managed by a mayor and a city council.

The political power provided by the large municipal budget to mayors, municipal councils, and their planning staff seems out of proportion with the modest role of managers and of competent janitors that the function would require. Hence the temptation to use this power in an abusive manner, as shown in the preceding chapters.

We have seen an expression of municipal hubris in the preceding chapter. New York City zoning rules are no longer limited to establishing good-neighbor norms and to mitigating obvious negative externalities but are now aimed at designing the city through regulations. A municipality is fulfilling its proper role when it simply coordinates municipal public investments with the investments of private developers, as it has done, for instance, in the development of the Hudson Yard project in New York.

Over the centuries, farmers have learned to counteract the worst entropic consequences of agriculture by various means: crop rotation, fallowing, terracing, manuring, and the like. These measures do indeed slow down the losses. In fact, given favorable circumstances it is possible to construct systems of sustainable agriculture that keep entropic losses to a bare minimum. Such systems are necessarily labor intensive and scrupulously conservative—more like horticulture than our usual notion of agriculture. For instance, traditional rice farmers in some parts of Asia were able to achieve a relatively stable, man-made agricultural climax (by using night soil, among other measures).3

But it is a path to perdition. John Maynard Keynes described the peril in these words: By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method they not only confiscate, but they confiscate arbitrarily; and, while the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some. The sight of this arbitrary rearrangement of riches strikes not only at security but at confidence in the equity of the existing distribution of wealth…. As the inflation proceeds…all permanent relations between debtors and creditors, which form the ultimate foundation of capitalism, become so utterly disordered as to be almost meaningless; and the process of wealth-getting degenerates into a gamble and a lottery.13

Aristotle taught that the moral life is life lived on the basis of example. A person becomes just by imitating just persons. One way of teaching good habits is by watching good people, learning the moves, imitating the way they relate to the world. For Aristotle, apprenticeship was essential to the task of morality—an ethically inexperienced person looking over the shoulder of someone who was good at it. Aristotelian ethics were thus “elitist” and not democratic, in the sense that such ethics presuppose people who are better at morality than other people. There are, in a sense, ethical aristocrats whose habits are worth observing, imitating, copying.

We are claiming, then, that a primary way of learning to be disciples is by being in contact with others who are disciples. So an essential ethical role of the church is to put us in contact with those ethical aristocrats who are good at living the Christian faith. One role of any colony is to keep the young very close to the elders—people who live aright the traditions of home. There is no substitute for living around other Christians. We do not know what to do with people like Dorothy unless we are taught, trained. Jesus’ view of Dorothy is so different from that of the world that it must be demonstrated, reiterated, reinforced.

Harry stared up at the bright blue sky, and thought of the Milgram experiment. Stanley Milgram had done it to investigate the causes of World War II, to try to understand why the citizens of Germany had obeyed Hitler. So he had designed an experiment to investigate obedience, to see if Germans were, for some reason, more liable to obey harmful orders from authority figures. First he’d run a pilot version of his experiment on American subjects, as a control. And afterward he hadn’t bothered trying it in Germany. Experimental apparatus: A series of 30 switches set in a horizontal line, with labels starting at ‘15 volts’ and going up to ‘450 volts’, with labels for each group of four switches. The first group of four labeled ‘Slight Shock’, the sixth group labeled ‘Extreme Intensity Shock’, the seventh group labeled ‘Danger: Severe Shock’, and the two last switches left over labeled just ‘XXX’. And an actor, a confederate of the experimenter, who had appeared to the true subjects to be someone just like them: someone who had answered the same ad for participants in an experiment on learning, and who had lost a (rigged) lottery and been strapped into a chair, along with the electrodes. The true experimental subjects had been given a slight shock from the electrodes, just so that they could see that it worked. The true subject had been told that the experiment was on the effects of punishment on learning and memory, and that part of the test was to see if it made a difference what sort of person administered the punishment; and that the person strapped to the chair would try to memorize sets of word pairs, and that each time the ‘learner’ got one wrong, the ‘teacher’ was to administer a successively stronger shock. At the 300-volt level, the actor would stop trying to call out answers and begin kicking at the wall, after which the experimenter would instruct the subjects to treat non-answers as wrong answers and continue. At the 315-volt level the pounding on the wall would be repeated. After that nothing would be heard. If the subject objected or refused to press a switch, the experimenter, maintaining an impassive demeanor and dressed in a gray lab coat, would say ‘Please continue’, then ‘The experiment requires that you continue’, then ‘It is absolutely essential that you continue’, then ‘You have no other choice, you must go on’. If the fourth prod still didn’t work, the experiment halted there. Before running the experiment, Milgram had described the experimental setup, and then asked fourteen psychology seniors what percentage of subjects they thought would go all the way up to the 450-volt level, what percentage of subjects would press the last of the two switches marked XXX, after the victim had stopped responding. The most pessimistic answer had been 3%. The actual number had been 26 out of 40. The subjects had sweated, groaned, stuttered, laughed nervously, bitten their lips, dug their fingernails into their flesh. But at the experimenter’s prompting, they had, most of them, gone on administering what they believed to be painful, dangerous, possibly lethal electrical shocks. All the way to the end. Harry could hear Professor Quirrell laughing, in his mind; the Defense Professor’s voice saying something along the lines of: Why, Mr. Potter, even I had not been so cynical; I knew men would betray their most cherished principles for money and power, but I did not realize that a stern look also sufficed.

I want to be able to verbally communicate for as long as I can. I want to know who is in the room with me and be able to engage with him or her. I do not want to be in pain or suffer unnecessarily.

I wish to be able to eat food and drink water independently. The same approach is useful as you define what does not meet your definition of quality of life and identify what you don’t want. For example: I hate the ventilator and never want to do that again. If there is no chance I will get better and be able to return to my home, I do not want to go to an institution or nursing home. If aggressive treatments and surgeries have little chance of improving my health and will likely diminish my quality of life, I do not want those treatments. Thinking in terms of real-life situations and being specific is important, because your family and friends may think they know what you want or have a general idea, but they could be way off base when it comes to the details. Have you read the book The Diving Bell and the Butterfly? The author, Jean-Dominique Bauby, was paralyzed in an accident and suffered from locked-in syndrome. He was only able to blink one eyelid, and this became his sole means of communication. Would Bauby’s prognosis meet my definition of an acceptable quality of life? Nope. Would it for my friend Mira? Not so fast. “If I am not in pain, and that is important, I do not want to be in pain, and I can be awake and present and see out of one eye . . .

Science writer Ralph Moss noticed the odd criteria that the FDA used to approve drugs that allowed scores of ineffectual drugs to gain approval: If you can shrink the tumor 50 percent or more for 28 days you have got the FDA’s definition of an active drug. That is called a response rate, so you have a response . . . [but] when you look to see if there is any life prolongation from taking this treatment what you find is all kinds of hocus pocus and song and dance about the disease free survival, and this and that. In the end there is no proof that chemotherapy in the vast majority of cases actually extends life, and this is the GREAT LIE about chemotherapy, that somehow there is a correlation between shrinking a tumor and extending the life of the patient. An example of the current state of cancer drugs is bevacizumab (Avastin). It received FDA approval in 2004 for the treatment of metastatic colon cancer and later received approval for other applications including breast cancer. To treat the average breast cancer patient with bevacizumab cost $90,816 per year without extending overall survival. But because it shrank tumors in a fraction of cases, the FDA approved it, highlighting the absurd criteria used for drug approval. Worse, patients who were treated with bevacizumab on top of paclitaxel had double the chance of experiencing significantly higher toxicity. Doctors must have realized the contradiction when recommending bevacizumab. Did they really tell patients that they should take a full course of the drug but would likely experience two and a half times the normal toxicity? The drug cost almost $100,000 and wouldn’t extend life at all. Why would an oncologist prescribe it? “There is a shocking disparity between value and price, and it’s not sustainable,” said Roy Vagelos, MD, at the 2008 annual meeting of the International Society for Medical Publication Professionals.

In the VM-M3 mouse model of metastatic cancer, they tested the combination of the ketogenic diet, HBOT, and ketone supplementation. The treated mice exhibited decreased growth of both the primary tumor and metastatic spread to the lungs, kidneys, spleen, adipose tissue, and liver. Also, and more importantly, the treated mice lived 103 percent longer than controls, again illustrating the power of synergy with metabolic therapies. D’Agostino

perturbations.” Cancer researcher Adrienne Scheck of the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, Arizona, agrees: “I have no doubt this disease will have to be treated through combinations of therapies.” Yet the clinical trial framework established by the FDA encourages the testing of single agents, one at a time. It is a slow and frustrating process. Worse, we are in the midst of a productivity crisis in oncology. A mere 6.7 percent of drugs that enter clinical trials make it to FDA approval. Vincent DeVita summed up the dire situation in his 2015 book The Death of Cancer: Attacking multiple hallmarks [of cancer] at the same time requires that we do complex clinical trials of a new kind. . . . The new studies need to be planned using the wiring diagram of the cancer cell in question as the blueprint. And they must be conducted in a radically different way from conventional studies. These studies hold extraordinary promise, but they are virtually impossible to achieve under the government’s current regulations.

treatment. Over the next couple of years, with his colleagues at ChemoThermia, Slocum helped to develop a regimen they term Metabolically Supported Chemotherapy (MSCT). According to Slocum, the general strategy of MSCT is to “do anything to disturb the cancer cells by exploiting [their] metabolic derangement.” As it happens, in Turkey guidelines for the care of patients with very advanced cancers are much more permissive than the United States and the EU. Oncologists are given the latitude to try anything, within reason, that they think might help—in other words, they are given permission to figure it out. Specifically, treatment with MSCT looks like this: A patient is immediately put on a version of the ketogenic diet. Then, prior to commencing chemotherapy, a fourteen-hour fast is followed by a pharmacological dose of insulin as well as doses of the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) and dichloroacetate (DCA). Next, with the patient in a state of hypoglycemia (blood glucose levels around 50–60 mg/dL), normal doses of chemotherapy are administered. Alongside this protocol the patient is also given extensive treatments of hyperbaric oxygen and hyperthermia. “In the last two to three years we have mastered our approach,” said Slocum. How good are their results? Slocum percolated with enthusiasm as he handed me a paper published in January 2016 by the ChemoThermia team detailing their experience using MSCT in pancreatic cancer.

Some of the lowest-carbohydrate whole foods that have the highest nutrient value are sprouted seeds from vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage, and radishes. Sprouts are not available in most grocery stores but are easy to grow (in water) at home in just four days using kits that can be purchased online.

In a well-known formulation, the social theorist Karl Polanyi wrote in his seminal work The Great Transformation (1944): “The catastrophe of the native community is a direct result of the rapid and violent disruption of the basic institutions of the victim (whether force is used in the process or not does not seem altogether relevant). These institutions are disrupted by the very fact that a market economy is foisted upon an entirely differently organized community; labor and land are made into commodities, which, again, is only a short formula for the liquidation of every and any cultural institution in an organic society.... Indian masses in the second half of the nineteenth century did not die of hunger because they were exploited by Lancashire; they perished in large numbers because the Indian village community had been demolished.”90

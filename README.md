# Josh Thompson's personal site

If you're reading this, you're reading something that won't ever be published on [josh.works](https://josh.works/)

I've got some slight notes rolling around here, and some to-dos for myself.

### To do

- [ ] run link checker with `rake test`. Fix results.
- [x] Systematize fixing broken links (https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer) (after migrating from squarespace-style absolute URLs to liquid templating dynamic URLs that play well with permalinks - my internal links are a hot mess)
- [x] style email subscribe box to match rest of site



Making a change on master. I want this and my other branches changes to show up here.

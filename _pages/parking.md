I propose that your business or building *might* be affected by "parking lots" or "parking spaces". 

In the greater united states, and elsewhere, the 'resource' known as 'parking spaces' is not well managed, for a variety of factors.

There's room for improvement, by "importing" ideas and norms from places in the world where they are currently functioning to _your_ parking lot. 

I'd like to be that importer for you. Could we discuss on the phone?

I've already written some things about parking, and the mobility networks attached to parking spaces:

## Resources I might mention

If/when we talk, I'll possibly reference a few books. Why does it matter? To show defensibility of my unusual propositions, and as a way to 'show my work'.

First, parking really really is mismanaged. This is a professor who works at the American Planning Association, but plenty of city staff who are 'planners' have never heard of him. ðŸ™„

Did you know that about 1/3rd of drivers driving around downtown at any given moment are looking for a parking spot? By implementing Donald Shoup's three-part fix, most/all of that driving would go away.

Ask me about his recommendations for eliciting favorable decision-making from one's local traffic engineer. [here's an interesting interview of the author](https://www.youtube.com/live/26LuHqFQ0bY)

## Reasons This Won't Work

I'm keen to try to accomplish this 'fix parking and some other things' project, but for a few reasons inherent in the problem I want to work on, it almost certainly won't work quite as I will wish it did. It might still be fine, it might work better than expected. 

American parking is partially broken for the same reason that "Urban Renewal" programs in the USA in the 1960's were broken. Or, alternatively, there are some ways that when parking feels broken, it's working exactly as intended, for someone else. 

Those energies are obviously tricky to deal with, but I think they're also solvable. Surprisingly so, in some situations.

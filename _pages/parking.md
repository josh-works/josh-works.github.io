I propose that your business or building *might* be affected by "parking lots" or "parking spaces". 

_Note: This particular page is very much a draft of something, or perhaps operating as a "friend-catcher"._

In the greater united states, and elsewhere, the 'resource' known as 'parking spaces' is not well managed, for a variety of factors.

Some of you own buildings inside of which businesses operate, and lots of the people involved with the business make regular use of parking. 

Parking meters, parking lots. Sometimes people get tickets. Sometimes they get towed. Sometimes staff are annoyed, sometimes customers. Obviously plenty of people visiting the space are not driving. They walk, they bike. They have their own collection of experiences.

Things feel one way when the sun is up, and another way when it's dark.

The default parking/parking lot/parking space "experience" in the USA is not great, for anyone. I'm (boldly? humbly?) proposing that it can be vastly different, dramatically better.[^dramatically-better]

[^dramatically-better]: 'dramatic improvement' is an understatement.

There's room for improvement, by "importing" ideas and norms from places in the world where they are currently functioning, and configuring them to work in/around your parking lot.

I'd like to be that importer for you. Could we discuss on the phone?

I've already written some things about parking, and the mobility networks attached to parking spaces:

## Resources I might mention

If/when we talk, I'll possibly reference a few books. Why does it matter? To show defensibility of my unusual propositions, and as a way to 'show my work'.

First, parking really really is mismanaged. This is a professor who works at the American Planning Association, but plenty of city staff who are 'planners' have never heard of him. ðŸ™„

It's 700 academic pages. Fortunately you don't need to read the whole thing. The author has a short "too long, didn't read" implementation suggestion. Perhaps we'll discuss it. 

And:

[Killed By A Traffic Engineer](https://islandpress.org/books/killed-traffic-engineer). The author, Wes Marshall, lives and works here in Colorado. Ask me about his recommendations for eliciting favorable decision-making from one's local traffic engineer. [here's an interesting interview of the author](https://www.youtube.com/live/26LuHqFQ0bY)

## Reasons This Won't Work

I'm keen to try to accomplish this 'fix parking and some other things' project, but for a few reasons inherent in the problem I want to work on, it almost certainly won't work quite as I will wish it did. It might still be fine, it might work better than expected. 

American parking is partially broken for the same reason that "Urban Renewal" programs in the USA in the 1960's were broken. Or, alternatively, there are some ways that when parking feels broken, it's working exactly as intended, for someone else. 

Those energies are obviously tricky to deal with, but I think they're also solvable. Surprisingly so, in some situations.

I've been working on the idea of treasure hunts, games, and more.

Lots of different people might end up on this page, and for different reasons.

For example, if you've been given a _handwritten note_ with a link to this page, what is your name?

As an experiment, try visiting "your" page on my website. Right now, the URL of this page looks like:

`https://josh.works/treasure_hunt`


Now, who's house features prominently in the below video?

Go to `https://josh.works/<name>`, and see if you're right!

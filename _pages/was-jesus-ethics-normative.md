I want to discuss the central claims of a book I've read recently, but it relates to some other threads that I need to weave together.

The book's title is: [The Politics of Jesus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19133.The_Politics_of_Jesus) by John Yoder. 

I'd not heard of this book, or this author, until quite recently. I heard of the book, decided I wanted to read it shortly after hearing of it, ordered it from Amazon, and started reading it. 

I've been recommending this book, or discussing the ideas contained within it, for a while. I wanted to make some of the key pieces easier to share, and here we are. 

This page is a draft. So far, the precipitating cause for all of this is the section of text [I've copied for you to read below](#copy-of-text-from-p11-to-p13)

------------------------------------------

The book is written for persons interested in the topics of:

- does Jesus Christ have any relevence for the modern world?
- if Jesus Christ has relevence for the modern world, what is it, and why?

The author sets the stage for the book by pointing out that:

*Mainstream biblical ethicists explicitely state: "Jesus is simply not relevant in any immediate sense to the questions of social ethics."*

Mainstream biblical thought defends the above claim in a three-part proposition:

## 1. Jesus is irrelevant to modern ethics
## 2. Therefore, there must be some kind of alternative bridge into another mode of thought when we begin to think about ethics
## 3. Because we have to build an ethic independent of Jesus, we'll can rely on nothing but "common sense" and [natural theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_theology)

The above statements would strike many as unfathomable. 

It certainly tickeled my brain when I read it. But as I read the author's support for the first claim, I felt more and more lightbulbs going off. 

_I have heard all of these messages in sermons my entire life_. 

Not every preacher or church _actively_ preaches messages of Jesus' irrelevance, but most of them do. The author gives six examples of how modern biblical scholarship makes a subtle case that Jesus is irrelevant:


Jesus's irrelevence is proclaimed in six ways:

### 1. the ethic of jesus is an ethic for an "interim" which Jesus thought would be very brief

It's _possible_ he was concerned about social structures, because he thought the world would be passing away soon. He didn't think about how societies need to survive, and for big institutions required for social order. 

His attitudes about rejections of violence, of self-defense, and of accumulating wealth for the sake of security, and the footlooseness of the prophet of the kingdom are not permanent and generalizable attitudes towards social values. 

### 2. Jesus was a quaint, simple rural figure. 

He talked about sparrows and lilies to fishermen and peasants, lepers, and outcasts. His radical personalizations of all ehical problems is only possible in quaint, ancient times, when the only way people _could_ talk was face-to-face. 

Therefor, Jesus' ethic had nothing meaningful to say on complex organizations, on institutions and offices, cliques and power and crowds.

### 3. Jesus lived in a world here he (and his followers) were low-status, and couldn't do any better

Since Jesus and his followers were outcasts, they couldn't even _conceive_ of exercising social responsibility in any other way than simply _being_ a faithful witnessing minority.

Christians have made BIG progress since them, basically all of Western culture is based on Christian principles, and that's such a huge jump in complexity. Christians together must accept responsibilities that were inconceivable in Jesus' situation. 

### 4. The nature of Jesus' message was ahistorical by definition. 

He delt with spiritual and not social matters, with the intellectual and not the concrete. 

He didn't proclaim social change and obedience, he proclaimed self-understanding and atonement. 

Whatever he said and did of a social and ethical character must be understood not for its own sake but as the symbolic or the mythical clothing of his spiritual message. 

If the Gospel texts were not sufficiently clear on this point, at least we are brought to a definitive clarity by the later apostolic writings. 

Especially Paul moves us away from the last trace of the danger of a social misunderstanding of Jesus and towards the inwardness of faith. 

### 5. Jesus was a radical monotheist. 

He pointed people away from the their specific lives and brought their attention to the sovereignty of the only One worthy of being worshiped. 

Because God is so BIG and we are so SMALL, all human values become relative. God's will cannot be identified with any single ethical answer, or given any value, because all of these things are finite and He is infinite. 

### 6. Jesus came to save mankind from its sin.

The work of atonement, the gift of justification, whereby God enables sinners to be restored to his fellowship is a gracious gift. 

This act of justification is correlated to one's self-understanding in response to the prolcaimed Word, but it's not correlated with ethics. 

Just as guilt is not a matter of having committed particular sinful acts, so justification is not a matter of proper behavior. 

How the death of Jesus works out justification is a deivite miracle and mystery; how he died, or the kind of life which led to the kind of death he died, is therefore ethically immaterial. 

----------------

So much for the six ways modern Biblical thought actively claims that Jesus is irrelevant. 

After claiming that Jesus is irrelevant, and not useful for making meaningful decisions about right and wrong, modern biblical thought casts about to create a viable connection between the Bible and the modern world. 


## 1. Because Jesus is irrelevant, there must be some kind of alternative bridge into another mode of thought when we begin to think about ethics. Not just a bridge from then to now, but from _theology_ to _ethics_, or _right thinking_ to _right actions_. 

## 1. Because we have to build an ethic independent of Jesus, we'll use common sense and [natural theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_theology). 

We'll measure what is "fitting" and "adequate", what is "relevant" and "effective". We'll be "realistic" and "responsible". 

The nature of things is heald to be adequately perceived in their bare givenness. The right is that which respects or tends toward the realization of the essentially given. 

It is by studying the realities around us, _not by hearing a proclamation from God_, that we discern what is right. 



It's language is opaque, highly technical, and precise. My language is intentionally a little looser. 

The author is arguing that _most Christian thinkers today_ would actually think that Jesus is _not_ directly relevant to social ethics, and that his life and ministry bears no relevence to their lives!

I was raised in the church (Baptists/non-denom), went to a reformed presbyterian church in college, and have attended presbyterian churches ever since. Calivinism, TULIP, and more. In high school, I attended a church pastored by Joshua Harris. He has since undergone a massive shift in his regard to his faith in Jesus. He used the term "deconstruction"[:josh-harris-quote]. 

Look up [Deconstruction on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deconstruction). Seems to focus a lot on the relationship between text and meaning, concepts of truth and justice, and rapidly touches on other... complicated... topics. law, anthropology, historiography, linguistics, sociolinguistics, psychoanalysis, LGBT studies, and feminism. 

Anyway, I have a somewhat weary knowledge of several very specific kinds of church and church organizations inside of America today. You, the reader, might be equally familiar with this certain breed of church organization today.  

I think I have been hearing these organizations preaching, my entire life, a message that distills down to `Jesus is irrelevant` . 



> Since Jesus isn't actually relevant in the modern world, we have to "bridge" from his life in the Bible to any kind of *real* ethical standard. Sure, he's helpful for things like "absolute love" or "humility" or "faith", but the stuff of right and wrong? ethics? We've got to come up with that ourselves!

What if, on Sunday, the next time you're listening to a sermon (live or in-person), the pastor said:

> Now, open your Bible's to Psalms 23. I'm going to talk about this portion of scripture. 
> 
> Oh, by the way, I don't think Jesus *actually* matters to us today, in fact, this entire book is junk, but it _is_ rather interesting from a few different perspectives, and I'd like to talk about them today...

How would you react? 

At a minimum, I hope it piqued your attention. If you thought you were getting a sermon from a trustworthy source, you might be re-evaluating that opinion. 

Most of you would already be horrified. Jaws on the floor. That whole record-scratch sound. 

I think that this above statement is broadly true for many churches and institutions in America today. 



The author of this book makes two claims, both of which are devestating to the church if they're true. 

He claims that christians _hide from jesus' relevence_

## Copy of text from p11 to p13

_I, Josh, add some line breaks and comments along the way, to improve my own understanding of the author's points._

[...] What I propose here is rather that, once we are sensitized by those questions, we might begin at the front again by seeking to read one portion of the New Testament without making the usual prior negative assumptions about its relevance. 

Or let me say it more sharply: 
**I propose to read the Gospel narrative with the constantly present question, "Is there here a social ethic?"** 

I shall, in other words, be testing the hypothesis that runs counter to the prevalent assumptions: 

The hypothesis that the ministry and the claims of Jesus are best understood as presenting to hearers and readers not the avoidance of political options, but _one particular social-political-ethical option_.

This study is then addressed to two quite discrete tasks. In substance and procedure the two will be distinct, calling for different kinds of methods and demonstration.

1. I will attempt to sketch an understanding of Jesus and his ministry of which it might be said that such a Jesus would be of direct significance for social ethics. (This is a task of New Testament research immediately within the concerns of biblical scholarship.)

2. I will secondly state the case for considering Jesus, when thus understood, to be not only relevant _but also [normative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative)_ for a contemporary Christian social ethic. 

Let us be fully aware that the endeavor will have any meaning at all only if both of the answers turn out to be affirmative. 

If (for general reasons of systematic and philosophical theology such as have been widely dominant in theological ethics for a long time) Jesus, whoever he was, is no model for ethics, it then becomes immaterial just who he was and what he did.[^rephrased-jesus-model]

If, on the other hand, Jesus was not like everyone else a political being, or if he demonstrated no originality or no interest in responding to the questions which his sociopolitical environment put to him, it would be pointless to ask about the meaning of his stance for today. 

To simplify the question and bring it within workable dimensions, I propose to concentrate largely on one document, on the canonical text of the Gospel according to Luke. Luke's story line provides us with a simple outline, and his editorial stance is often taken to have been a concern to deny that the Christian movement was any threat to Mediterranean society or Roman rule. 

This centering upon Luke for our scattered soundings is not meant to slant the reading any other Gospel that the only way to get from the gospel story to ethics, from Bethlehem Rome or to Washington or Saigon, was to leave the story behind. 

I shall be looking more at the events than at the teachings, more at the outlines than at the substance. 

The next pages present soundings rather than a thorough survey.

Nor is it the intention of this book to be exegetically original. 

At no point do I mean to be hazarding unheard-of textual explanations. All that I add is the focusing effect of a consistent, persistent question. 

It is because I claim no originality at this point that I may dispense with some of the pedantic paraphernalia which would be helpful or needful if I were making claims never heard before.

--------------------------------

The book is worth reading. It's complicated, heavily footnoted, and quite academic.

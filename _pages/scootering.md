I pursue ease, joy, and meaningfulness. Sometimes successfully.

A big part of that ease and joy comes from being able to nearly effortlessly move around the city I live in, parking literally whereever I want, always very close to my destination. I ride something a bit bigger than a bicycle, that is fairly fast, and powered by something other than my own legs. 

It's a scooter, and you deserve to be warned that I'm going to low-key try to convince you to buy a scooter, or move your overton window towards that being a reasonable decision. 

Alternatively, if you're already scooter-curious, or you already ride a bike around the city, I think you've got the skills and the disposition to go make it happen, and I'll try to help you down that path, too.

I believe scooters are a tremendous vehicle class, and those who do the work of learning how to safely and comfortably operate them in a certain range of conditions can unlock shocking ease for themselves. 

And interestingness. Even among people who ride scooters a lot (very common in Asia) I've got some 'street cred' that makes me a suitable guide through this obviously real-life and serious series of decisions I'm advocating for.

For starters, [look here](https://joshs-mobility-data-54dab943ebba.herokuapp.com/?zoom=20&latlng=39.740098,%20-104.973393)

This is a banal intersection in Denver, Colorado. The lines represent my 'paths' I've taken, when I've walked around or been riding my scooter, and 'recording' my trip. 

I use a certain phone application called Strava to record very acurately where I have travelled. The data can be quite accurate. I've been tracking my own location data in a *ahem* non-trivial fashion for a while, precisely to build the map you can look at above.

So, you can zoom out on that map link above, and see that I have travelled around rather a lot of the city of Denver, and beyond. 

This page is ultimately aimed at trying to get you to consider buying this sort of vehicle for yourself, even if 'just' for occasional use. There's a common sort of conversations about scooters, often comparing and contrasting them with either e-bikes, stand-up type e-scooters, motorcycles, and cars.

In each of these cases, I want to say, firmly, something like "Yes, I see what you are saying, but I still maintain that there is a fundamental mis-apprehension you have for how flexible and convenient this sort of vehicle is and can be."

If you're looking at this page, it's possible you've seen my scooter parked somewhere, and indeed scanned the QR code on the side. 

I plan on making a little complaints form on this page, so if something I've done with the scooter causes you consternation, I'd love to hear about it. It's possible that I believe you, and or/I agree with you, and/or I care. Regardless, there's only one way to know, so feel free to email me. 

I've had a few conversations with people, explaining something about how I ride my scooter, in which I said:

> I generally ride according to Balinese scooter norms.

I'll let that hang in the air for a while. If I'm asked to expand upon the statemenet, something like:

> In Bali, your scooter flows sort of like a liquid, through the landscape, sort of a 'if it fits, it goes' mentality, and sometimes sort of treat stop lights as stop signs. 

I am highly risk averse, and teach others to be the same!

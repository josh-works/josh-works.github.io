I pursue ease, joy, and meaningfulness. Sometimes successfully.

A big part of that ease and joy comes from being able to nearly effortlessly move around the city I live in, parking literally whereever I want, always very close to my destination. I ride something a bit bigger than a bicycle, that is fairly fast, and powered by something other than my own legs. 

It's a scooter, and you deserve to be warned that I'm going to low-key try to convince you to buy a scooter, or move your overton window towards that being a reasonable decision. 

Alternatively, if you're already scooter-curious, or you already ride a bike around the city, I think you've got the skills and the disposition to go make it happen, and I'll try to help you down that path, too.

One of my favorite things about using a scooter in the USA, especially in cities, is how they can be parked anywhere, and in large numbers. If me and a few friends are meeting up for something, parking is virtually effortless, even in places otherwise full of cars:

I believe scooters are a tremendous and convivial vehicle class, and those who do the work of learning how to safely and comfortably operate them in a certain range of conditions can unlock shocking ease and adventure for themselves. 

And interestingness. 

## I request to be considered a good guide in this domain

Here's a recap of my journey into scooting:

1. As a kid, I had a mountain bike and rode adventurously in the neighborhood and surrounding areas. 
2. Later, as a young adult, did bike commuting, while also using trains and busses,
3. had a car, always a used honda or toyota, as an older adult
4. got a city commuting bike when living in Golden, CO and spent a TON of time riding it around the city of Golden, CO, esp during Covid. 
5. eventually found myself a bit limited for getting around, especially if my destination was a bit outside of Golden, or there was nighttime or inclement weather to take into account
6. didn't feel great about an e-bike, also didn't feel good about a motorcycle. I took a motorcycle riders training class anyway, thought I might some day want a small motorcycle but really didn't like the machines
7. at a bike event in Golden, found myself chatting with an emergency room doctor, talking about his really cool cargo e-bike, that was carrying many people and things. He loved it, and it was more expensive than any car I'd ever purchased. (It was $11k!) He agreed with me about not liking motorcycles, and he suggested I consider a scooter. At that point I hadn't considered this, so this nudge was extremely helpful.
8. I'd forgotten that I'd ridden a 50cc scooter in Greece once, as a rental to get around the island of Kalymnos for climbing, and hated how loud it was, and it didn't feel safe, especially with a passenger and a hill and their bucket style helmets. 
9. so, I drove myself to [sportique scooters](https://maps.app.goo.gl/v7ZyNbfzCBSrukMp9) and rode a few scooters around. A few days later, I purchased a brand new Genunie Buddy 125. It looked identical to the Turquoise scooter in the picture earlier in this article.

That was summer of 2020, and began a huge shift for my life. 

Originally, I rode this 125cc scooter around Golden, exclusively. Mostly where I rode my bike. I figured out how to ride safely with traffic, and had a TON of fun finding all the places I could go with the scooter. 

I subsequently got a job in Denver, and at least some times would ride my scooter from Golden, to Denver, and back.

That commute was where I really squared away a lot of details, a lot of beta, for getting a lot of usage out of this sort of vehicle. 

Eventually, the scooter got stolen. Like a fool, I'd not locked the steering column when I left it outside a climbing gym, and someone had been driving by in a box truck, spotted it, parked, and simply rolled the scooter into the back of the van and drove off. I eventually recovered the vehicle, but it had been hotwired, the seat was broken open, and then the main problem was it was crashed, so the front forks were damaged.

I replaced it with a 170cc scooter with larger tires and a little more weight and suspension. This instantly made my commute from Golden to Denver _much_ more comfortable and safe. 

[I eventually rode that 170cc scooter from Denver to Canada, then Seattle, and back.](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipN8q_LjvazfURfQUjnI21GQz23_PqlznCQ2fYC6OYCy15AIypU47XTi5S_mPdtaMw?key=N29iaXpDYXI5X2pFVjBUTGpQQmE5TmZTSnYyci1R)

That trip helped me get MUCH more beta about skilled scootering. Weather, distance, hammock camping, and more. 

I then spent a bunch of time in different parts of Asia. (Bali, Taiwan, Thailand, Nepal) riding scooters in each country. I found it possible to be safe in all of the places I rode. 

For instance: 

<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7302666678926888238" data-video-id="7302666678926888238" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;" > <section> <a target="_blank" title="@josh_exists" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists?refer=embed">@josh_exists</a> <p>there are those who call themselves professionals, who deny at an existential level, the road networks like the ones common in Asia, even exist. The road Network in this particular video is so-so. The narrow streets at the end, are delightful. Thailand has been economically colonized by Western financial institutions, and Western financial debt instruments, which lead to pouring way too much concrete in order to make space for way too many pickup trucks and cars. But where the original road Network exists, it&#39;s delightful and adequate. But I keep coming off as a person detached from reality, because American planners find it inconvenient to acknowledge realities from other parts of the world.</p> <a target="_blank" title="♬ Mwaki - zoozee" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Mwaki-7263163108771694593?refer=embed">♬ Mwaki - zoozee</a> </section> </blockquote> <script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script>

I've got lots of timelapse footage floating around, and appreciate that when I post a big timelapse, it might look like I'm moving a lot faster than I actually am. My favorite speed is "never wanting or needing to go any faster than 30mph". 

Even among people who ride scooters a lot (very common in Asia) I've got some 'street cred' that makes me a suitable guide through this obviously real-life and serious series of decisions I'm advocating for.

For starters, [look here](https://joshs-mobility-data-54dab943ebba.herokuapp.com/?zoom=20&latlng=39.740098,%20-104.973393)

This is a banal intersection in Denver, Colorado. The lines represent my 'paths' I've taken, when I've walked around or been riding my scooter, and 'recording' my trip. 

I use a certain phone application called Strava to record very acurately where I have travelled. The data can be quite accurate. I've been tracking my own location data in a *ahem* non-trivial fashion for a while, precisely to build the map you can look at above.

So, you can zoom out on that map link above, and see that I have travelled around rather a lot of the city of Denver, and beyond. 

This page is ultimately aimed at trying to get you to consider buying this sort of vehicle for yourself, even if 'just' for occasional use. There's a common sort of conversations about scooters, often comparing and contrasting them with either e-bikes, stand-up type e-scooters, motorcycles, and cars.

In each of these cases, I want to say, firmly, something like "Yes, I see what you are saying, but I still maintain that there is a fundamental mis-apprehension you have for how flexible and convenient this sort of vehicle is and can be."

If you're looking at this page, it's possible you've seen my scooter parked somewhere, and indeed scanned the QR code on the side. 

I plan on making a little complaints form on this page, so if something I've done with the scooter causes you consternation, I'd love to hear about it. It's possible that I believe you, and or/I agree with you, and/or I care. Regardless, there's only one way to know, so feel free to email me. 

I've had a few conversations with people, explaining something about how I ride my scooter, in which I said:

> I generally ride according to Balinese scooter norms.

I'll let that hang in the air for a while. If I'm asked to expand upon the statemenet, something like:

> In Bali, your scooter flows sort of like a liquid, through the landscape, sort of a 'if it fits, it goes' mentality, and sometimes sort of treat stop lights as stop signs. 

I am highly risk averse, and teach others to be the same! 


## Various reasons josh likes scooters

They are cheap. My first scooter, a [Genuine Buddy Kick, 125](https://www.genuinescooters.com/products/buddy-kick-125i) was $3500, new. This is not cheap. My bicycle cost me $130, but that was pre-covid. I know people that spend $3000 on a bike, or much more. 

It got stolen, and I replaced it with a [Lance Cabo 200i](https://www.lancepowersports.com/models/cabo200i.html) also for $3500. It was a huge upgrade, with larger tires and displacement, doing better with passengers, gear, and higher speeds. 

Insurance is cheap. (I've got State Farm, full, comprehensive coverage, for like $50/month)

A tank of gas is $4.50, and gets close to 100mpg. 

I can park it almost anywhere. Including sidewalks, and scooter friends can as well, so even going to something like a night market or park event or convention or concert or Red Rocks, I can zip right to the closest spot to the door/entrance, and find a place to park. 

Free use of parking garages. You can ride around the gate or through a pedestrian access point.

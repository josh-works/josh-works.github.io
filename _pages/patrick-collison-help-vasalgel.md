Tweet at [Patric Collison](https://twitter.com/patrickc) info about [Vasalgel, a multi-year contraceptive](https://www.parsemus.org/projects/vasalgel/), which works via [Reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_inhibition_of_sperm_under_guidance)
 
Ask that they be funded in line w/progress studies article:

- [We Need a New Science of Progress (The Atlantic)](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/)
- [Science Is Getting Less Bang for Its Buck (The Atlantic)](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/diminishing-returns-science/575665/) 

### add page to my website custom-built for Pcollison, why he should support Vasalgel

Others are not supporting Vasalgel. Dollars here are disproportionately valuable, around the world.

# What does Vasalgel need? 

They need money. But they also need advertising, marketing, a way to help get through FDA screenings faster.

- Drip email campaign
- KickStarter
- big name support

They [are setup to take donations](https://www.parsemus.org/donations/), but it's amateur. They would do better on KickStarter. 

You can help with all of these things. 

I cannot personally introduce the team behind Vasalgel to SF Startup money, but you can. And to the talent they need to bring this world-changing product to market.

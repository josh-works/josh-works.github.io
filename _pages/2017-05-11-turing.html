<p>Throughout my time at Turing, I try to teach what I learn, because <em>that helps me learn better</em>. </p>
<p>As I write stuff, I usually save it as a gist on Github. Those are not searchable, and it's hard sometimes even for me to remember what I've written.</p>
<p>What follows below is a curated list of useful material, ordered by either the module it might best apply to, or a more general category:</p>

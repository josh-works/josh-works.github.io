I love to solve _meaningful_ problems, with a high value-per-effort-unit ratio. 

## Retainers

I do retainers, billed monthly at the beginning of the term.  

I aim for a minimum monthly payment amount of about $1000, and a maximum amount of about $5k. 

> Why not say $25k or $50k, Josh. Don't you want to earn more than $5k/month?

I have a cap of $5k because that's a quite modest amount of money to the organizations that would be interested in hiring me. They spent 3x that amount sending their team to a conference, and they don't even know exactly what sort of value they got from that conference. 

They don't think they're getting a full-time hire (those cost more like $12k/month), but they know they're getting a useful tool in the toolbox for solving some specific problems.

So, they bring me in at $5k/month for a few months, and I'm not doing any "diving save" for their organization. I'm there to help them move long-term numbers, like:
- Help their newest software developers become stronger engineers in less time than otherwise.
- Boost retention of engineers at all levels of the organization
- Unblock amorpheous and weird cross-team communication problems that are slowing down your feature delivery and increasing tech debt. (AKA you're validating [Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law).)

I don't know for sure that I can do all this. You wouldn't believe me if I said I did, anyway. But in some specific situations, I can. And if it's at all possible that I could deliver this value for your team, ultimately hundreds of thousands of dollars of value, it's worth spending an hour and $250 of not-your-money to find out. 

Book the session here, using your company's credit card[^company-cc]: [https://calendly.com/joshthompson/roadmapping](https://calendly.com/joshthompson/roadmapping).

If you don't have a company credit card, or a way to get this expense easily reimbursed, Please book a session at $50 here [here](https://calendly.com/joshthompson/roadmapping-50).

If you think it's strange that I have two prices for what seems to be a very similar service, please book a call at whatever price seems appropriate, and we'll discuss it soon[^free-option]!


[^free-option]: I have a free option, too. ðŸ˜‰ Check out my "grab a coffee with me" open invite: [https://calendly.com/joshthompson/coffee](https://calendly.com/joshthompson/coffee). And yes, right above, I do this for $250. Book a session, ask me why. 


## One-off 'consulting'/rubber-duck debugging

Yep. I do lots of one-offs. I generally call these "roadmapping sessions". Usually, at the end, there's some sort of obvious set of next steps. Sometimes these next steps require a lot of work, and I do that work. 

Sometimes these next steps require you to go ask some questions of others, think for a few days/weeks, and then we discuss it again, or we don't.

Basically, this is the cost to pick my brain on something. Each price links to the relevant Calendly page, where you'll pick a time, Zoom or somewhere in Denver, and make a payment via Stripe.

Why do I have "expensive", "cheap", and "free" options, all side-by-side? If you're wondering, pick one of and ask me to explain. _It's totally fine if it's the free one_. 

-----------------

There are other categories I'll add here along the way, like:
- resources for early-career software developers
- a [guide targeted to tech-savvey millenials who are "the computer person" to their parents](https://josh.works/upgrade-parents-junky-old-laptop-to-chromebook)

And more.

You have meaningful problems. I enjoy hearing about them and brain-storming on them.

This isn't a "sales" page. It's likely you and I have already swapped emails, phone calls, possibly had coffee/drinks together, Zoom calls, or maybe a few years ago I said something that stuck in your head and you want to explore it some more.

Either you or I have a suspicion that we should talk a bit more directly about the problem at hand.

So here's how to book that direct discussion. You'll book an hour of my time, you might pay me for it (if you're interested in an ongoing work arrangement where money changes hand, I'd encourage a paid roadmapping session), and then we'll talk.

I'll deliver you 10x in value as you spend on the session.

I was interviewing for a new job. I know Josh loves the topic of salary negotiations, so I gave him a call and he coached me through the process. 

One week and two phone calls later, I got the job **and I’d negotiated a $15k/year raise over what the company claimed was the highest they could go.**

## Roadmapping Sessions

### How It Works

1. You click the link below (read 'em all, if you want. They all go to different Calendly pages)
1. You answer some questions
1. You confirm the date/time, pay via Calendly/Stripe
1. I'll email you some follow-up questions to help build context before we actually chat
1. We meet (IRL or Zoom) and chat about this
1. I take detailed notes, and follow up afterwords

These roadmapping sessions are the jumping off point to all other work arrangements. 

#### 👉 [$250 Roadmapping Session](https://calendly.com/joshthompson/roadmapping) (Please select this option only if you're using a company credit card)
#### 👉 [$50 Roadmapping Session](https://calendly.com/joshthompson/roadmapping-50) 
#### 👉 [$0 ☕️🍺 chat](https://calendly.com/joshthompson/coffee)

Why do I have "expensive", "cheap", and "free" options, all side-by-side? If you're wondering, pick book a session (any session!) and ask me to explain. _Hint: Which one offers an NDA?_


## Retainers

I do retainers, billed monthly at the beginning of the term.  

I aim for a monthly payment amount of ~$1000-5000, and of course I am to deliver multiples of that cost in value (5-10x, minimum). 

> Why not say $25k or $50k, Josh. Don't you want to earn more than $5k/month?

I have a cap of $5k because that's a quite modest amount of money to the organizations and teams I best work with. 

They have a team of engineers, each costing $12k/month, minimum. A team of five is going through $60k/month in payroll. 

For a very modest fee, I deliver improvements around employee retention, [Conways Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law), and ultimately, _I help you and your team deliver more value to your employers, your customers, and yourselves._

Someone evaluating me for this opportunity - they just have to know if I'm trustworthy and/or can deliver what I say I'll deliver, but again, at such a small cost as a $250 roadmapping session, it's easy to see if this is a possibility. 

I don't know for sure that I can do all this. You wouldn't believe me if I said I did, anyway. But in some specific situations, I can. And if it's at all possible that I could deliver this value for your team, ultimately hundreds of thousands of dollars of value, it's worth spending an hour and $250 of not-your-money to find out. 

Learn more about the session (and schedule it if you want) here:

Alternatively, if $250 is a bit steep but you still want to talk, I'd love to do so:

👉 **[Book roadmapping session (discount)](https://calendly.com/joshthompson/roadmapping-50)[^free-option]**


[^free-option]: I have a free option, too. 😉 Check out my "grab a coffee with me" open invite: [https://calendly.com/joshthompson/coffee](https://calendly.com/joshthompson/coffee). And yes, right above, I do this for $250. Are you curious why this might be? Book a session, ask me why.

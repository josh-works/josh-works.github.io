# You Belong

You belong in tech. Don't take my word for it, of course. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have a lot of black girls ask me how they can prepare themselves to work in STEM because it dominated by white men and they feel out of place. My advice is to not think about it. You have every right to be in this industry. Don&#39;t self inflict imposter syndrome on yourself.</p>&mdash; adaobi (@adaobiadibe_) <a href="https://twitter.com/adaobiadibe_/status/1281175105528348673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 9, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

### Why am I here?

My name's Josh. I have a role to play in reducing systemic oppression. I don't know what it is yet. 

### Keep learning more?

If you're part of an underrepresented group in tech, I would love to help you however I can. 

I don't "mentor" people, I _vastly_ prefer [to sponsor them](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/adv/article-mentorship-vs-sponsorship-whats-the-difference-and-why-does-it/).

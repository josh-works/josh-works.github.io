# You've been unsubscribed

Hey! You've been unsubscribed from at least one list here.

I, personally, have never unsubscribed from a list "in error", so I won't pretend that you've done the same. 

I use the same tool (ConvertKit) to manage subscribers to two different websites. This website, and [https://intermediateruby.com/](https://intermediateruby.com/).

If you're seeing this page, you've been unsubscribed from any communication associated with [https://josh.works/](https://josh.works/), but if you ever signed up for emails from [https://intermediateruby.com/](https://intermediateruby.com/), you'll probably still get them.

Thanks for tagging along with me!

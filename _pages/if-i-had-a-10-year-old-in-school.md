## Why I'm writing this

From [this HackerNews thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23793216)

> Khan Academy continually gets held up as a great resource for online courses across the age spectrum for math related subjects. With the continuing pandemic continuing to grow in the US and schools not really sure how to handle things, the GF and I are looking into other options.
> 
> Is there a recommended resource that gives unbiased (as possible) reviews for middle school (7-8th grade) curriculum? Searching these days really doesn't bring up quality, just options one has to comb through.


Someone left this answer:

> I'm a teacher with 15 years of experience and an edtech entrepreneur. I've reviewed thousands of secular homeschool programs for accuracy and quality. We're working on developing unbiased reviews of all of our favorites, but here are a few great all-in-one programs to get you started. All mastery-based, all secular and aligned with state standards. In general, these also combine hands-on projects with online learning, involve little to no prep time and minimal parent involvement in learning, with some element of personalization.

> I'm confused by the current approach to schooling in the U.S. As functioning adults, society rewards folks who can identified unanswered problems and come up with solutions. Meanwhile education focuses on drilling facts. In formal education, not including extra curriculars, the first time I see learners exposed to unanswered questions is graduate school.

> I feel one of the best ways to learn is to practice the thing you are actually going to be doing. It's odd that we never practice answering novel questions. I.E. introducing the unanswered questions of the past, the context that lead us to asking them, and the approaches humans took to solving them. Do you know of any home-school programs that include something like this? 

This begs a good question. 

What are we educating children _for_? 

That's a contentious question, and not one I'm willing to even try to answer, though I have a lot of opinions. 

Instead, here's a rough "curriculum" I might hand to my kid as older than a ten year old. I'm writing this document up because I've got a lot of friends who have kids who are fretting about what they'll do next year because of Covid. 

Go back to school? not go back to school? Do school from zoom?

I personally find all of these questions mostly irrelevant, as "traditional school" is, broadly, harmful to children and educators. (hot take, I know.)

Reflecting on my own time when I was in middleschool and highschool, I thought the world was far smaller and more boring than it actually is. I just never had anyone point out the interesting opportunities I could have pursued. 

Next, I don't think _most_ adults in America have the same lense on the world as I do. I'm young-ish (31), and I straddle a few communities, like:
- Liberal software development crowds
- Conservative Christian republican communities
- high-performing athletic communities (rather accomplished rock climbers)
- Rationalist/effective altruism communities

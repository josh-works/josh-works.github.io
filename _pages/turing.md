I graduated from Turing in 2017. You might be curious about Turing, or software development in general. If that's the case, this page is an easy jumping-off point into all the resources I've written and collected that could aid you in this process.


Please note - I've been helped by so many other people both directly (emails, async or synchronous conversations) and indirectly (they wrote/created something that I learned from and was helped by). This page, and the general list of resources you'll find around this website are my modest attempts to help others in the way I've been helped. 

I'm always eager to hear about areas where these guides are unclear or cause confusion, and I'm quick to refine things. Please send me an email at `thompsonjoshd` at Google's popular email service or, if you're in the Turing slack, send me a message. I'm `@josh_t`. 

Finally, feel free to set up a session to chat about whatever's on your mind over at [josh.works/office-hours]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/office-hours.md %})


## Learning how to learn

If you're making the jump into software development, you'll be learning a lot. Non-stop, and for the rest of your career, learning will play a pivotal role in the execution of your job. 

If you could either learn `slowly and with great difficulty`, or you could learn `quickly and with less difficulty`, which would you choose? 

Presumably the former. On that note:

* [Learning how to learn]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-06-04-learning-how-to-learn.md %})
* [Anki and Memorization with Spaced Repetition Software]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-06-06-memorizing-programming-with-anki.md %})
* [Asking experts, and gaining more than just answers]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-05-29-ask-better-questions.md %})


## Ruby-specific exercises

The _primary_ audience of the following resources are Turing students who are getting ready to begin the program, but they're equally appropriate for someone who's considering the whole software development/Turing option anyway.

If you're reading this post, are using a Mac computer, [these setup instructions](http://mod0.turing.io/) are appropriate to enable you to pursue the specific instructions and video walk-throughs contained in these posts:

- [Turing Prep Chapter 1: Make Mod 1 Easier Than It Otherwise Would Be]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-05-09-turing_prework_01_intro.md %}) 
- [Turing Prep Chapter 2: Your first passing tests!]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-05-19-turing_prework_02_getting_the_right_files.md %}) 
- [Turing Prep Chapter 3: Video walk-through of a few of the mythical creatures, like `unicorn.rb`, `dragon.rb`, and `hobbit.rb`]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-05-31-turing_prework_03_mythical_creatures.md%})
- [Turing Prep Chapter 4: Arrays, Hashes, and Nested Collections]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-06-09-turing_prework_arrays_hashes_nested_collections.md %})
- [Turing Prep appendix: Troubleshooting Errors]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-05-19-turing_prework_troubleshooting.md %})

If you work through even half of the videos contained above, you'll be fantastically prepared to begin the Turing program and well positioned to not struggle too hard in the first module. 


## Miscellaneous resources that could aid you as you go through Turing

## Mod 1: Ruby and other fundamentals

* [Practice with Github (I gave a 'github fundamentals' talk)](https://github.com/josh-works/git_practice)
* [Playing with the HTTP send/response cycle in Ruby, without Faraday (the "HTTP Yeah You Know Me" project)]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-04-07-playing-with-the-http-sendresponse-cycle-in-ruby.md %})

## Mod 2: Sinatra, Active Record, and Rails

- More coming soon

## Mod 3: Consuming and Building APIs, brown-field projects, AJAX, caching, background workers

[William Thomas](https://www.turing.io/alumni/william-thomas) and [Rhonda Wilhemlson](https://www.turing.io/alumni/rhonda-wilhelmson) prepared themselves for Mod 3 much better than I. I felt a bit let down by the pre-work, and poorly prepared. [I struggled a lot]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-05-17-finding-an-edge.md %})

Here's what William and Rhonda did, and what I wish I'd done, before mod 3 started:

- [Build a RESTful JSON API with Rails 5 (part one)](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-restful-json-api-with-rails-5-part-one)
- [API on Rails, chapter one](http://apionrails.icalialabs.com/book/chapter_one)
- [CodeSchool, Surviving APIs with Rails](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/surviving-apis-with-rails)


## Mod 4:

[OSS contributions (don't fear the sharks) by Leta Keene](https://medium.com/@letakeane/contributing-to-open-source-the-sharks-are-photoshopped-47e22db1ab86)

_This page is now functionally "locked", as I've completed my time at Turing. I'm keeping it live as I'll still be sharing resources here with others. [My very brief Turing retrospective]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-08-09-turing-retrospective %}
)_


Throughout my time at Turing, I try to teach what I learn, because _that helps me learn better_.

As I write stuff, I've usually saved it as a gist on Github. Those are not searchable, and it's hard sometimes even for me to remember what I've written.

What follows below is a curated list of useful material, ordered by either the module it might best apply to, or a more general category. These are intended to benefit current/future Turing students, and encompass much of what I've written during my time at Turing.

## General

*   [Deliberate Practice (Lightning Talk)](https://gist.github.com/josh-works/65802ebf3c90025b113b52cbf6a79c71)
*   [outline of resources on GIS/d3/data vis](https://gist.github.com/josh-works/084d8aaa6ddb405236e293f485982e4e)
*   [Example of how I ask a very knowledgable person for help (hint: make it easy for them to have the information, and respond in their time)](https://gist.github.com/josh-works/9a386cd033dec833b65257af6eaa4fbc)
* [Learning how to learn](http://localhost:4000/learning-how-to-learn)

## Before Turing

*   [An opinionated guide for those who finished mod1 prework](https://gist.github.com/josh-works/9366bece56a2b10a814ec727a8f6b45e)
*   [Terminal fun, to be better with your command line](https://gist.github.com/josh-works/83fc75e684b4dd2d52b385a67ced4d9b)
*   [Get set up on drills](https://gist.github.com/josh-works/ac68a974cb9e0d73d663ea6c8cf3e8d8)
*   [More terminal customization stuff](https://gist.github.com/josh-works/7f2e6c82d22dca6e9fbc029c8b17703d)

## Mod 1: Ruby fundamentals

*   [Notes from HTTP Yeah_You_Know_Me](https://gist.github.com/josh-works/59b17f5aa8d3ab7ac899c7a4a2fae92d)

## Mod 2: Sinatra, Active Record, and Rails
* [Tour of D3 for Clueless Folk like me](/tour-of-d3/)

## Mod 3: Consuming and Building APIs, brown-field projects, AJAX, caching, background workers

* [Ask Better Questions]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _posts/2017-05-29-ask-better-questions.md %})
* [Opinionated thoughts on workflow and tooling]({{site.baseurl}} {% link _posts/2017-05-27-developer-workflow.md %})

#### Better Prework

[William Thomas](https://www.turing.io/alumni/william-thomas) and [Rhonda Wilhemlson](https://www.turing.io/alumni/rhonda-wilhelmson) prepared themselves for Mod 3 much better than I. I felt a bit let down by the pre-work, and poorly prepared. [I struggled a lot]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-05-17-finding-an-edge.md %})

Here's what William and Rhonda did, and what I wish I'd done, before mod 3 started:

- [Build a RESTful JSON API with Rails 5 (part one)](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-restful-json-api-with-rails-5-part-one)
- [API on Rails, chapter one](http://apionrails.icalialabs.com/book/chapter_one)
- [CodeSchool, Surviving APIs with Rails](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/surviving-apis-with-rails)


## Mod 4:

I didn't write anything significant in mod 4.

I've got drafts for posts re: OSS contributions, etc.

In the mean time, [read this great post by Leta Keene](https://medium.com/@letakeane/contributing-to-open-source-the-sharks-are-photoshopped-47e22db1ab86)

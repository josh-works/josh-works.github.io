_The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York_, pages 1021-1025

_no chapter of the book can do this story justice. I'd love to do detailed explanations of other chapters some day. There's three or four other chapters that I wish Robert Caro would expand into entire books._

_Context: Haddad and Gleason, two journalists, led the movement that took Robert Moses out of power. They worked together to publish the stories and articles that ended Robert Moses._

Luckily, Haddad and Gleason were already friends. Gleason gave him information, and Haddad was soon writing stories based on it. The Posť's stories had the effect on Gleason's city desk that he had known it would; his editors got interested in Title I [slum clearence] again-even more so because Gleason was able to provide them with new leads, given him by Haddad. For Haddad quickly arrived at the same realization as Cook and Gleason. "We found out very early that it had to be a joint effort," he says. “It would never go. It would rise and die in one paper, unless another paper picked it up. Then the TV would pick it up and then the political authorities would start to react. That was the carbohydrate that made it work." 

Soon, like two flamenco dancers spurring each other to wilder and wilder efforts, Haddad and Gleason were both helping and striving to outdo each other, their stories picking up and taking off from each other's and hitting harder and harder. As the tempo accelerated, moreover, the tipsters joined in again, a whole chorus of disgruntled bureaucrats who realized that this time there was a real chance that_someone would print their information.

_Next, we see two other papers get involved, because of what Haddad and Gleason started._

With its two competitors playing a scandal in banner headlines day after day, the third afternoon daily couldn't ignore it even if its top executives would have liked to: soon the Journal-American was printing Title I stories. Then, tentatively at first, then more and more boldly, readers were given a chance to read about Title I in the morning as well: the Trib was in.

But the pooling continued. In fact, there soon sprang up a circle at whose heart were Haddad and Gleason but which included also Woody Klein of the Telly, the Journal-American's Marty Steadman, Peter Braestrup of the Herald Tribune, and a reporter from the underground, thirty-one-year-old Mary Perot Nichols; born a Philadelphia Main Line Wasp, she had moved to the East Village, begun crusading against Moses' proposed road through Washington Square Park, and had seen at a glance truths about Moses' whole method of operation that no one, seemingly, had understood before; her only journalistic connection was The Village Voice, but her observations in it were in many ways the most penetrating printed up to that time. 

These reporters would meet almost daily with Hortense Gabel, the one willing to openly help them. There was no one “important" at that table **"We were chipmunks," Hortense Gabel would recall. “[Moses] wouldn't even know who we were. There was no one important even in journalism." But they met daily, an underground movement, to force the city's journalistic establishment to do what they wanted.** 

**In any assessment of their motivations, their age is important. Everyone in the circle was in his late twenties or early thirties.** 

Recalling those days, years later, Haddad would say with a rueful smile: 

> Our motives? It was us against the world, us against them-the city, corruption, unmovable forces. We were idealists. 

They were also young. They hadn't even been born when Robert Moses had been on the front pages battling the robber barons to open Long Island to the masses. They had been only infants when Jones Beach was dedicated. In 1934, when Robert Moses had revitalized New York City's park system, to the city's cheers, Gleason had been only seven years old, Haddad six. 

The Robert Moses they knew was not the Robert Moses of the beautiful parks and the beautiful parkways-the parkways that were going to solve traffic problems. 

The Robert Moses they knew was the Robert Moses of the Tavern-on-the-Green and Manhattantown and those damned expressways he insisted on building even though everybody knew the city should be building subways instead, and for which he evicted thousands of helpless families; their impression of him was of an arrogant, dictatorial old man who, if not corrupt himself, had certainly managed to surround himself with a lot of corrupt people; like the Newmans, **they were too young to have seen him as great; they saw him only as crotchety, old-and wrong;** their perception of the Coordinator was unclouded by the preconceptions that had clouded reporters' eyes in the Twenties and Thirties, that he was the selfless, incorruptible, apolitical public servant _sans peur et sans reproche_. **They saw him as he was**

The members of this journalistic cabal were also too young to be afraid. Those rare reporters of the Thirties and Forties who might have contemplated investigating the Moses empire had been very conscious of what had happened to reporters who had tried it before. But it had been a long time now since Robert Moses had broken a reporter, so long that Haddad and Gleason didn't even know that he ever had. 

Haddad, the spiritual heir of Milton Racusin, a _Herald Tribune_ reporter who a decade earlier had investigated the Moses empire and written a series on it but had seen the series killed (and had been forced to personally apologize to Moses to boot), had never even heard Racusin's name, much less the story of how his career had been wrecked. 

If the age explanation was simple, the psychological was not. The motives that inspired these young reporters to take on “the most powerful SOB" in the city were as mixed as are the motives of all investigative reporters. One cannot talk to some of them for long without knowing that at that table the desire for personal self-glorification, as well as the simple desire to drag down someone bigger than they. But, with most of them at least, so was a spur of a purer metal. "Can't somebody do something about the son of a bitch?" Gleason had shouted to Cook in frustration one day, and behind that shout was the outrage, the “sense of injustice," that Lod built up in him and in his partner over what Moses and the city's other power brokers were doing to “the little human beings ... who get trampled in their game." 

"To me," Kahn says, “he was the personification of a certain arrogance against the average man. I don't think he ever cared about how many hearts he had to break to Get Things Done. And so I felt he _had_ to be stopped. And there wasn't anyone else to stop him but us." If most young men of intelligence and drive are ambitious, not all of them put that intelligence and drive at the service of justice as had a Gene Gleason or a Bill Haddad. And they kept chipping away at the image of Robert Moses. After thirty years of building up that image, the press had begun chopping it down

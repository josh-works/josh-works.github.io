This is step 1 of this treasure hunt! You made it!

If you got this far, shoot me a text, let me know you completed the first challenge! If you need a word for proof, you can use "snarlax".

My phone number is 240-483-2951, but add "1" to the last digit.

If I said "add 1 to the first digit", i'd be wanting you to text `340-483-2951`

This was, indeed, Fish's house.

Can't wait for that text. More to come.

Challenge 2: inspect the source of this website. Find the HTML. What's the domain of the _last_ url listed in the file? it's a `script dever` tag, loads a bit of javascript.

I might do `curl -L josh.works`, but there's lots of ways to read the HTML of a web page.

visit `josh.works/domain_you_found`, lets see if you figured it out.


josh.works/cloudfront

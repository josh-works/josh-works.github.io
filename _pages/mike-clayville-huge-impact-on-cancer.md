_note: I wrote this as if I could get an email read specifically and intently by Mike Clayville. I didn't wait until I finished that I realized I have no credible/reliable delivery mechanism. I'm requesting help to get this to Mike. If you're the right person, **you can ask Mike to read this, and he will**._

Hi Mike,

Something interesting just happened.

Patrick Collison is one of 17 people I follow on Twitter, so I read this tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As we expand our portfolio of products and services, and work to power a growing cast of global companies, we&#39;re delighted to add Mike Clayville to the team: <a href="https://t.co/7dgwDIVcah">https://t.co/7dgwDIVcah</a>. <a href="https://t.co/eNmVuLxHFb">pic.twitter.com/eNmVuLxHFb</a></p>&mdash; Patrick Collison (@patrickc) <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/1291103130420015104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

_[Stripe Newsroom: Stripe hires Mike Clayville as Chief Revenue Officer](https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/mike-clayville)_

I read it. I've never heard of you until 10 minutes ago, but it looks like Stripe just make a _great_ investment in convincing you to apply your problem-solving abilities to what they are trying to do in the world. 

I skimmed the release, and a sentance jumped out at me. It may have seemed unimportant to most people.

![Outside of work, Mike is passionate about cancer research and serves as a board member of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center](/images/2020-08-05-mike-clayville-01.jpg)

My wife and I have been personally affected by cancer.

I would guess that you have been personally affected by cancer, too. _You must loathe it's existance_. 

If Stripe just convinced you to join their team, you are likely to feel intellectual alignment with the company and founders. 

Which means you would not find it unbelievable that an established institution might not welcome innovation, _even though they state that they welcome innovation_.

There is precedent  of industry opposing (in creative ways) inputs if their <strike>revenue</strike> <strike>stability</strike> <strike>control of industry</strike> <strike>relationship with regulatory bodies</strike> broadly-defined "interests" might be <strike>negatively</strike> effected. 

**You are well-positioned, for a variety of reasons, to make a potentially enormous impact on the state of cancer research, cancer prevention, etc.**

**The exact reasons you could have such an impact requires additional context, all of which is explained in this book: [Tripping Over the Truth: The Metabolic Theory of Cancer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23496164-tripping-over-the-truth)**

----------------------------------

I've considered how I might convince you to invest the time of reading this book to explore if there might be even a fraction of a possibility that what I am right.

I'll pay $5000 to an organization of your choice (including the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center) if you read this book. Half now, half when you're done. <sup>1</sup>

I will donate another $2500 to an organization of your choice when you indicate that you've finished reading the book. No need to discuss the book with me at all. 

Here's the book:

[Tripping Over the Truth: The Metabolic Theory of Cancer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23496164-tripping-over-the-truth)

I've hopefully evidenced good intent and skin in the game. I am happy to discuss this more on a call, even if just an explanation of why you should spend ten or twenty hours reading the book.

[--> Schedule a call](https://calendly.com/joshthompson/skin-in-the-game)

This is my quickest possible solution. I had limited time today, this is the best I can put together. I hope to talk soon.

\- Josh

PS I'll pay other people to read the book too. At least $25, until I run through $1000. Let me know. `joshthompson@hey.com` or [@josh_works (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/josh_works)

PPS This is so janky, this whole format. Here's my plea for this format of getting this read seriously by Mike:

**1** _I originally guessed (and still maintain) that you won't actually want compensation. You are intrinsically motivated to reduce the role of cancer in the modern world. But the world is awash in causes that want your money. If it was a problem that could be solved with the simple application of money, we would have rallied and solved it a long time ago._

_But then I realized that if I just asked you to read a book.... you might see me as saying "here's a chance to educate yourself", and that's feels condiscending, which is emphatically not my goal. I, myself, am busy, and couldn't pour hours of carefully crafting a "pitch", so I'm seeing if I can offer to simply 'buy' a solution. I'm already behind on other stuff I was trying to get done today!_

# Welcome!

I'm Josh. I do a mix of things, mostly related to software development, rock climbing, and helping software developers and rock climbers be better at what they do. 

My wife and I are based in Golden, CO, but both work remotely and spend a fair bit of time traveling. 

Get in touch via [twitter](https://twitter.com/josh_works) or [email](mailto:thompsonjoshd@gmail.com).

## Remote and Asynchronous

While at [Wombat Security](https://www.wombatsecurity.com/) (acquired by [Proofpoint Inc](https://www.proofpoint.com/us)), and previously at [Litmus, Inc](https://litmus.com/), I've worked 100% remotely, saw most of my coworkers a few times a year, and lived in the same time zone as almost none of them.

I was [once interviewed on working remotely]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2016-03-16-my-interview-with-pajamasio.md %}), and believe that in the right context, the constraints imposed by remote work can improve the quality of your work. (I'm in the habit of _writing everything down_ and summarize and itemize everything. See the top of this post, that index? It's habit, made by working remotely. _You cannot over-communicate in a remote environment._)

Remote work is great when you live in one place, but also opens the door to [cool travel opportunities](http://teamthompsontravels.tumblr.com/post/145144220613/1-year-travelversary-exactly-one-year-ago-on-may)

I occasionally write up thoughts about remote work, and these posts are all collected [here](https://josh.works/tags#remote_work).

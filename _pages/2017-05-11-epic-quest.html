<p>There is a lot to do in the world.</p>
<p>I get satisfaction from accomplishing goals and making things happen. I fear regrets. If I accomplished everything on this list tomorrow, I would just add items to the list, but this is a start.</p>
<p>Many of the items on this list count as an "investment". I can make an up-front effort and then let momentum exert its powerful influence. </p>
<p>I can enjoy most of these things for a long time with low-level "maintenance" work. Some of the items are stupid party tricks. The items on this list are not to make me look good, they are a reflection of my interests.</p>
<p>Steve Kamb's <a href="http://www.nerdfitness.com/epic-quest/">Epic Quest of Awesome</a> inspired this list.</p>
<p>As I accomplish an item, I'll link to a post about it. Click on what looks interesting.</p>
<h1>Josh's Epic Quest</h1>
<h2>Money</h2>
<p>My first categories are about money. Money is not everything, but its important. For many reasons, it is right and appropriate to manage it well. I also see money as a proxy of value, so if I accumulate money, that means I've delivered value. </p>
<h3><strong>Spending</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Track spending. How much goes out every month, what percentage of income is it? (done - write about YNAB)</li>
<li>Categorize spending. How much is regular, how much is variable. (Discretionary vs. non-discretionary.) (done - write about YNAB)</li>
<li>Save half of our income for one month (done)</li>
<li>Save half of our income for two months (done)</li>
<li>Save half of our income for three months (Done - YNAB reduced expenses, I maxed out 401k, roth, etc. Write about this.)</li>
<li>Negotiate rent reduction (even just $50/month) - possible prepay by the quarter? Willing to do so for $100/month decrease in rent. (Was given free parking pass)</li>
<li>Negotiate Comcast internet bill back down to the $30/month I was paying. (Got it reduced by $15/mo for one year)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Saving</h3>
<ul>
<li>Max out employer match for 401K (done)</li>
<li>Open Roth IRA (done)</li>
<li>Create automatic transfers to Roth, other savings accounts. (done)</li>
<li>Create savings accounts for long-term goals (done)</li>
<li>Carry no debt but student loans, and finish those up at above-minimum-payments. (done)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Earning</h3>
<p>There are two ways to have more money. Spend less, or earn more. I like the idea of both, so I have quite a few "on-the-side" financial goals, in addition to optimizing a fixed income as much as possible.</p>
<ul>
<li>Earn $100 by selling unneeded clothes and crap (yardsale - was a lot of work, worth it?)</li>
<li>Sign up for Odesk or Elance. (I choose to not do this. See "freelancing and decommodifying your services" - DYFR)</li>
<li>Meet with one company about Customer Experience freelance product (done)</li>
<li>Earn/book one job w/Elance or Odesk (nope)</li>
<li>Land one contract w/CX Freelance (Instant level up here) UX Feedback/implementation with KMDC Training Center!</li>
<li>Schedule a meeting to discuss compensation with manager</li>
<li>Earn a raise based off of my initiative. Minimum: $2/hr or $4000/yr. (done)</li>
<li>Meet with one freelance consultant, learn</li>
<li>Meet with three more consultants, to learn from them</li>
<li>Pay consultant for three hours of formal training</li>
<li>Earn $500/mo in "on-the-side" projects.</li>
<li>Earn $1000/mo in "on-the-side" projects.</li>
<li>Sell one digital product. (done)</li>
<li>Sell ten copies of a digital product.</li>
<li>Sell one copy of a digital product without being involved in the process. (done)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Investing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Read three books about investing and the stock market (done. Motley Fool, I will teach you to be rich, and "money, master the game")</li>
<li>Open a mock stock market account (free, no actual money involved) to practice. (nope)</li>
<li>Open savings account that will provide stock market money. (yep)</li>
<li>Set up automatic transfers for stock market money account (done)</li>
<li>Buy minimum number of stocks in 1 company (nope)</li>
<li>Buy three more minimums in three other companies (Forrester's CXI Top 5 companies)</li>
<li>Don't touch the money for a year</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Reading</strong></h1>
<p>Reading is a tremendous gift. There are wise, experienced people out there who have done what you want to do, done what you don't want to do, and lived through every imaginable experience. Sometimes it comes across as fiction, sometimes as non-fiction. It is all worthwhile. Reading can change your life.</p>
<p>Another benefit of reading is just about every thought in the world has been had before. If you claim to hold strong ideas, but don't know who it is that had them first, you're just repackaging (without attribution) the ideas of someone else. It makes it hard to have reasonable discussions when both parties think they're having a bunch of original thoughts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Read 56 books/yr, at 225 pages/book (or ~225 pages/week). Some books are much longer than that, so if I read a 500 page book, it's fine that it takes two weeks. (Have met this goal regularly, so I'll just leave it open.)</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://josh.works/read">I read a ton, so here's a partial list.</a></li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Marriage</strong></h1>
<p>Money can buy happiness, but only until you can pay for "the basics", like shelter and sustenance. After $40K a year or so, it no longer is a predictor of happiness. There are a few things that correlate well with happiness and are independent of income: Experiences, relationships, and serving others. Those three can be tightly linked with happiness. </p>
<ul>
<li>Surprise Kristi with something (flowers, a gift, a note) once a week.</li>
<li>Take Kristi on one date a week</li>
<li>Have entry in OUR journal/record once a week.</li>
<li>Improve quality of our fights.</li>
<li>Read and re-read quality marriage books together</li>
<li>Find a mentor couple. Meet once every other month.</li>
<li>Mentor a couple. Meet once every other month.</li>
<li>Seek out wise old people (WOP) to spend time with. Each meeting is a level.</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Traveling (experiences)</strong></h1>
<ul>
<li>Sign up for credit cards that earns miles a la <a target="_blank" href="http://frequentflyermaster.com/">Frequent Flier Master</a>. (done)</li>
<li>Earn 30,000 miles (additional levels @ 30,000 miles each. I stand currently at about 100,000 miles, with plenty of room to improve.) (done)</li>
<li>Earn in-flight or at-gate seat upgrade. (One level per upgrade) (I earned two "upgrade to exit-row" levels) (Saved $130, were I to pay outright for 'em)(And upgraded another five flights or so...)</li>
<li>Redeem miles for ticket (one level per passenger per flight. If Kristi and I go to Paraguay and it's two stops, that equals four levels) (Redeemed for flight to Colorado) (done)</li>
<li>Kristi and I book international itineraries for less than $1000 total.</li>
<li>Book round-the-world tickets for Kristi and I within two years. This spring: Paraguay (visit four other countries while there)</li>
<li>Spend one month traveling. (done)</li>
<li>Spend one summer traveling. (done)</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Relationships</strong></h1>
<p>Relationships and experiences are what matters. Most other stuff doesn't. To that end:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Never-Eat-Alone-Secrets-Relationship/dp/0385512058/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1371182170&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=never+eat+alone">Never Eat Alone</a></em>

<li>Reply to all personal emails within 24 hrs for two weeks. (done)</li>
<li>Reply to emails I don't want to reply to when I see them, even if just to say "I got this message - don't have time to reply right now, but I'll get back to you in a few hours." One level per week.</li>
<li>Follow up via email with every person I meet 24 hrs, 1 month, six months out. (link to personal CRM)</li>
<li>Compose "Wish List" of people or companies I'd like to meet.</li>
<li>Seek out, get to know, and meet with one person from the wish list.</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Serving Others</strong></h1>

<p> I want to make failure and vulnerability (gasp!) hip and cool, because of all the things I have to talk about, a pretty consistent theme is feeling like I've failed. The only way to talk about that (and thereby make this content relevant to you kind souls who are reading this) is by being vulnerable, which is hard, and generally uncool in our society. So I want to be vulnerable on here. I don't always have my act together, but I generally try <em>way</em>  too hard to seem like I do.</p>

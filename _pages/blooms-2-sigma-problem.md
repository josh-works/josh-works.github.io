I first encountered the "2-sigma problem" through Stripe Cofounder Patrick Collison's [questions](https://patrickcollison.com/questions).

> **Is Bloom's "Two Sigma" phenomenon real? If so, what do we do about it?**
> 
> Educational psychologist [Benjamin Bloom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Bloom) [found (PDF)](http://web.mit.edu/5.95/readings/bloom-two-sigma.pdf) that one-on-one tutoring using [Mastery Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_learning) led to a _two sigma_(!) improvement in student performance. The results were replicated. He asks in his paper that identified the "2 Sigma Problem": how do we achieve these results in conditions more practical (i.e., more scalable) than one-to-one tutoring?
> 
> In a related vein, [this large-scale meta-analysis](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0034654317751919) shows large (>0.5 [Cohen's d](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_d)) effects from direct instruction using mastery learning. "Yet, despite the very large body of research supporting its effectiveness, DI has not been widely embraced or implemented."

I'd recommend reading Bloom's original paper from 1984:

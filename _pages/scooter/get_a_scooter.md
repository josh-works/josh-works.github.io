I think you _want_ to get a scooter.

You don't yet want it strongly, and you don't know how badly you want it, but the desire is _very_ likely there. 

Let's find it, shall we?

Do you like:

- sitting in traffic?
- being bored out of your skull
- spending tons of money at the gas station
- breathing exhaust
- ruining the environment?
- polluting with engine exhust, tire rubber microplastics, and break dust?


do you like:

- parking really close to your destination
- being able to store items in your vehicle
- your vehicle being cheap to maintain and operate
- incredible flexibility
- conversation starters


I've ridden my scooter _everywhere_: [https://josh-strava-heatmap.herokuapp.com/](https://josh-strava-heatmap.herokuapp.com/)

My scooter cost me $4500, brand new.

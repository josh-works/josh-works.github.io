# 30 second version

I'd sorta like your permission to try to entertainingly, subversively, convince you of something, or show you something, or help you experience something that might leave you thinking:

> You know, I'm a bit more likely to ride a scooter

And eventually, for some fraction of you, I'd like to nudge you into the world of scooter owners. 

This "feat" really reflects as much on the friends of mine who have gotten scooters (and the friends of mine who already rode scooters) than it does on me. 

Scooters are _extremely_ fun and convenient. It's easy to feel at times a child-like joy on a scooter, and the friends of mine who have done the work to purchase a scooter all are quite capable of easy wonder and joy in an activity.

I still think that helping nudge fl a rather audacious feat I've already accomplished several times. I'll tell you those stories, and hopefully it'll be entertaining enough that you'll finish with two things having happened:

1. You'll maybe learn something interesting, or gain an interesting perspective. (For example, do you know what `desire paths` are? If not, you will soon!)
2. You'll be passibly entertained.  The time you spend reading this page will be better spent than at least one of the hours you spent last month streaming some show.[^i-value-your-attention]

[^i-value-your-attention]: Part of why I can promise that time here will be better spent than {blank} is because I absolutely care about your attention. I value it, in some ways maybe more than you even value it. I'm hoping to get you to upgrade your assessment of your own attention, though, and then we'll _both_ value it highly!





I know the internet is a strange place, and there's a certain form of "content" that does well, and this isn't that, mostly. These pages are word-heavy, and I use footnotes regularly. 

I'm going to try to move you one notch down on the "scooter overton window", between:


1. I have never even considered using a scooter as a way to solve problems in my life
2. I'm aware that scooters might work for some people
3. I can list some specific ways that some scooters do work for specific people
4. I could imagine some trips in my own life I might replace with a scooter, if I had one conveniently stored and appropriately accessible. 
5. I know how I would learn to safely ride a two-wheeled vehicle
6. I know where there's a local scooter shop 
7. I've visited and ridden a scooter around
2. I own my own scooter! And I'm swapping out some of my trips for scooter trips, but I might not feel super safe all the time
9. I'm comfortably swapping out certain trips for a scooter, and I feel safe and confident as I traverse the mobility network.
10. I feel safe as I ride it for most of my trips, going generally wherever I want, whenever.



There are many, many steps between those two spots. 

# What I (josh) don't like about scooters

# What I (josh) like about scooters

# How you might explore if you like or don't like them

# You like one? Want to buy one?

# You own one and now you can ride it whenever you want? How the heck do you do it in a way that feels safe?

------------------

When it comes to changing your physical location from one spot to another, in most situations, a scooter outperforms a car in the following ways:

- cost
- speed of travel
- management when in use
- storage when not in use


 
- cheaper-faster-funner-safer way to get around a specific area

# two-minute version

As part of a story that has many twists and turns, I found myself the proud owner of a very cute 125cc scooter back in summer of 2021, and it was *perfect* for zipping around Golden and the areas around Golden. I was very cautious on it, and didn't often go long distances. 

The story continued, and I kept being _delighted_ and _surprised_ at how convenient and enjoyable various aspects of my life became, _because_ I was riding a scooter.  [^tools-for-conviviality]

[^tools-for-conviviality]: To tie two possible threads together, the _reason_ activities 'feel different' based on the modality of transportation could be summarized by either [Tools for Conviviality]() by Ivan Illich, or 


















I nerd out hard about urban mobility infrastructure, and the built urban form. I can see it most clearly from a bike, and it's easiest to explain from a bike as well.

So, I'm conducting "academic infrastructure-related bike tours of Golden". 

It mostly likes like "riding around Golden with friends". 

I've been doing bike tours of Golden with friends. These are not "normal" bike tours, however you define them. 

- We don't need mountain bikes
- we'll probably drink a beer or coffee at some point
- You'll hear about some obscure books
- I'll point out a lot of stuff that is beautiful and interesting

I do the "tours" because I enjoy biking around Golden, and this page is to help me have an excuse to do more of them.

I like to highlight some aspects of Golden that most people miss. It brings me great joy, and I like to share that joy with others. 

Here's a heatmap of my biking around Golden. Feel free to visit the page, and zoom in/out the map.

This mass of lines marks the places I've ridden my two feet, my bike, or my 125 cc scooter around, and if we go on a bike ride, we'll ride some of these places.

Here's some recent trips if tracked in Strava:[^strava]

[^strava]: I apologize for the 🥔quality. I'll get an [_actual_ Strava API integration set up soon](https://github.com/josh-works/strava_run_polylines_osm), so I can display the activity in a reasonable way.

### What participants have said:

> Wow. I would never have noticed all of this.

> Also would great fun to do another bike tour. You should start charging for your tours. 

> I'm ruined, Josh. After wandering around Golden with you, I've started to see it (and other cities) with a whole new perspective, and I cannot un-see it.

Here's a few sample rides of what the bike tour might look like: 

Going forward, I'll make sure to record the actual bike tours, and I'll include pictures _from_ the tour.

I'll get actual photos from the rides added at some point. I tend to not have my phone out too much when biking around, as you might imagine. 



### Schedule A Private Bike Tour of Golden

Book a tour, and I'll give you information about the next few bike tours I'm planning! 

You'll either join an existing scheduled tour and a group (and probably meet some interesting people) or it might be just the two of us. (Want to go on a 10p bike tour of Golden when it's 22 degrees? There's not too many people into that kind of thing.)

Make a payment, and I'll email you to coordinate a good time, working around our respective schedules and weather and such. (It's 6 degrees with 6" of snow outside as I type these words. 🥶). On the flip side, sometimes the weather's really nice, and there's a big group about to go on a bike ride. Come join!

### The Private Tour + Drinks

The first principle of selling _anything_ is to give people options. I love to grab a ☕️, 🍻, or 🍷 before, during, or after a bike around Golden. But if I buy coffee for 30 people, that adds up.

Book this option, and I'll make sure the tour includes a stop by _at least_ one of Golden's many coffee shops and breweries. The drinks are on me. 😉

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### How long will the tour be?

Depends on your preferences. At least three miles, less than ten. Budget an hour if we're _just_ biking, or two hours if biking + drinks. Golden has great options for drinks and food, and I'd love to show you some of them!

#### When will the tour be?

This _also_ depends on your preferences. There's something magical about biking around Golden at night, and I've done it many times, so we're not even constrained by normal daylight hours. Could be a weekend afternoon, or a week-day afternoon, or a weekday evening. Or a morning. 

#### Do I need my own bike

If you have one, bring it! (and a helmet, and ideally a light or two for your bike, especially if we're riding around at night.) 

I have two extra bikes, both rescues from a dumpster, and I'm getting them into good repair. I will gladly let you ride the bike I usually ride around, which is the nicest bike I've ever owned, but it was a $150 find on Craigslist, so if you're a "bike person", you won't be impressed. 

#### Where will we meet?

Somewhere in Golden. We'll finish somewhere in Golden, too. Maybe we'll meet at my house, or we'll meet downtown, or at the Creek.

#### What if I have to reschedule?

If it snows, or it gets super cold, or your schedule changes, we can easily reschedule. I live in Golden and bike around it all the time (during the day and at night). It's rather difficult to inconvenience me, and rescheduling a bike tour isn't inconvenient at all.

#### What happens when I pay?

I'll send you an email, we'll figure out a good time, a place to meet, and we'll bike around for an hour or so. It'll be a bike tour unlike anything you've ever had. 😁

#### I have a question you've not answered. How do I ask it?

Shoot me an email (`joshthompson@hey.com`) or send a Twitter DM: [@josh_works](https://twitter.com/josh_works)

_if you're here via the QR code on my scooter, I think that's hilarious, and welcome, this is a tiny little experiment._

_er, this page is in draft status, for now check out my tiktok. It's mostly scooter stuff._ I run a javascript blocker, so third-party embeds never work for me. If you want to see my tiktok and scooter videos, please click the link:

or [here](https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7338845015361293611)

Otherwise, below, you'll maybe see a sample scootering video:

# 30 second version

I'd sorta like your permission to try to entertainingly, subversively, convince you of something, or show you something, or help you experience something that might leave you thinking:

> You know, I'm a bit more likely to ride a scooter

And eventually, for some fraction of you, I'd like to nudge you into the world of scooter owners. 

This "feat" really reflects as much on the friends of mine who have gotten scooters (and the friends of mine who already rode scooters) than it does on me. 

Scooters are _extremely_ fun and convenient. It's easy to feel at times a child-like joy on a scooter, and the friends of mine who have done the work to purchase a scooter all are quite capable of easy wonder and joy in an activity.

I still think that helping nudge fl a rather audacious feat I've already accomplished several times. I'll tell you those stories, and hopefully it'll be entertaining enough that you'll finish with two things having happened:

1. You'll maybe learn something interesting, or gain an interesting perspective. (For example, do you know what `desire paths` are? If not, you will soon!)
2. You'll be passibly entertained.  The time you spend reading this page will be better spent than at least one of the hours you spent last month streaming some show.[^i-value-your-attention]

[^i-value-your-attention]: Part of why I can promise that time here will be better spent than {blank} is because I absolutely care about your attention. I value it, in some ways maybe more than you even value it. I'm hoping to get you to upgrade your assessment of your own attention, though, and then we'll _both_ value it highly!


I know the internet is a strange place, and there's a certain form of "content" that does well, and this isn't that, mostly. These pages are word-heavy, and I use footnotes regularly. 

I'm going to try to move you one notch down on the "scooter overton window", between:


1. I have never even considered using a scooter as a way to solve problems in my life
2. I'm aware that scooters might work for some people
3. I can list some specific ways that some scooters do work for specific people
4. I could imagine some trips in my own life I might replace with a scooter, if I had one conveniently stored and appropriately accessible. 
5. I know how I would learn to safely ride a two-wheeled vehicle
6. I know where there's a local scooter shop 
7. I've visited and ridden a scooter around
2. I own my own scooter! And I'm swapping out some of my trips for scooter trips, but I might not feel super safe all the time
9. I'm comfortably swapping out certain trips for a scooter, and I feel safe and confident as I traverse the mobility network.
10. I feel safe as I ride it for most of my trips, going generally wherever I want, whenever.



There are many, many steps between those two spots. 

# What I (josh) don't like about scooters

There is very little I don't like about scooters. They're less fun in rain and bitter cold, than cars, usually.

# What I (josh) like about scooters

so many things, around ease of moving around when I'm using it, and ease of storing it when I'm not using it. Check the tiktok for more. 

# How you might explore if you like or don't like them

consider taking a motor cycle riders training class. I did mine [here](https://www.motorcycleridertrainingcenter.com/). The website is crusty, but you learn good stuff.

# You like one? Want to buy one?

Get a snell-approved full-face helmet. Armored riding gloves. A cell phone holder so you can see google maps while scooting. 

I got comprehensive insurance (collision, theft, damage, uninsured motorist coverage) via a local State Farm insurance agent for $60/month. I wasn't able to get theft coverage via Progressive (I got everything but theft through them, but they wouldn't do comprehensive coverage on my scooter, which was odd, so I switched to State Farm)

# You own one and now you can ride it whenever you want? How the heck do you do it in a way that feels safe?

ugh, so much to say about this. More on it later.


# two-minute version

As part of a story that has many twists and turns, I found myself the proud owner of a very cute 125cc scooter back in summer of 2021, and it was *perfect* for zipping around Golden and the areas around Golden. I was very cautious on it, and didn't often go long distances. 

The story continued, and I kept being _delighted_ and _surprised_ at how convenient and enjoyable various aspects of my life became, _because_ I was riding a scooter. Ease emerged everywhere, and convenience.

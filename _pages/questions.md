## What are non-traditional 'pass the hat' scripts for the tech community?

What jumped out at me:

> A common theme of stories of interesting people is the ridiculous amounts of leverage, for good or ill, of presence or absence of a small amount of money or some social resource early followed by compounding.
>
> Not a new insight, but one which I think we probably underappreciate.
>
> I think we're very, very far from the efficient frontier in terms of figuring out how to get capital (money and otherwise) to interesting people early.
>
> Part of the problem is intermediating institutions act to soak up unlimited amounts of it (looking at you, universities).
>
> there have been a lot of times in my life and those of people I'm acquainted with where a relatively small amount of money ($2,000 or $500 or $5 and *believe me* not exaggerating there) swung a very big door of a decision.
>
> One of the things I like about the tech community is a broad cultural trend of "Well since we haven't invented time machines yet we'll do the next best thing: figure out how to put present money in the hands of people who will go on to do interesting things."
> 
> Investing is one mechanism for this.
>
> There are others, and because discourses about wealth/charity/money/etc are always a little socially fraught, a lot of those stories are mostly untold, but a function of all communities everywhere is localized scripts for "passing the hat."

How do we not just "get these stories told" but get a runbook for the complexities. If I have $200 to spare, how can I find one of these opportunities to make a high-leverage gift to someone else?

I've found some of these opportunities, but they're all very serendipitous. I want more of these opportunities!

## What tiny tech-assisted 'proof of concept' business ideas are available to non-tech people?

I don't like how the tech community usually MVPs pure-tech ideas. A website that does something online, etc.

What's a run-book for starting a low-cost, low-effort "market research"-version of a backyeard restaurant? Offer one fixed meal in the AM for $10, and one fixed meal in PM for $20? 

zoning and regulatory barriers abound, but lets just imagine we didn't have to worry about violence from the state. What might we test? How would we get buy-in from the neighborhood? how would we get non-trivial money invested _before_ we spend non-trivial money ourselves?

# ✉️ Interdependent Newsletter ✉️

I was casting about a punchy title for my newsletter. That's what the cool kids do, right?

_in·​ter·​de·​pen·​dent \| \ ˌin-tər-di-ˈpen-dənt_

**Definition of _interdependent_:**

> dependent upon one another, mutually dependent 
> 
> Usage:
> - interdependent statistical variables
> - the interdependent gyrations of double suns 
> - the interrelationships between social groupings were reciprocal and interdependent.
> - In an interdependent world, every nation is dependent upon every other.

[interdependent (Merriam-Webster)](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/interdependent)

Many seemingly isolated phenomena are _interdependent_ with other phenomena. 

We, as people, are _interdependent_. We depend upon each other. 

This concept is a unifying thread of what I write about.

Currently, I'm thinking (and writing) on one of the best books ever written: [The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1111.The_Power_Broker).

I promise that it'll be somewhat eclectic writing, and likely to be _very_ interesting to some small subset of the population.👇👇👇

_i'm trying to get this in front of Charlie Hogan, I've got my normal array of options 📧📫🚶‍♀️🎙️but historically I work in software, and 'sending someone a link to an organic document' is super conventional, takes no time at all, so... I'm trying to nerd snipe charlie here._

_believe it or not, this isn't the first time I've done something like this, successfully! (and a few times less so, nbd, I get what I want no matter what.)_

## The long version 

I just moved to the neighborhood, after living elsewhere in Denver, Golden, and the world, since 2015. 

A long time ago, for reasons not important right now, I started a data gathering project on my own traveling around the city.

I go on walks, recording them in strava, for example this one:

[https://www.strava.com/activities/11651893494](https://www.strava.com/activities/11651893494)

Looks like this:

This particular walk was interesting. I was picking Eden up from Trader Joe's - 

I walked myself and her empty stroller there to pick her up, her mom dropped her off, and Eden and I meandered home, at a pace of 30 minutes a mile. 

a toddler walks, at about 30 minutes per mile, and she walked much of the way. We had such a nice time, as we always do. A few years ago, I took a back injury, and mastered the art of the slow walk. I'm the slowest walker of all my friends. :)

There's so much that could be done to make the streets safer, more vibrant. Pleasing to a child, which is pleasing to an elderly person, which is pleasing to a tired person, or someone in the heat or the sun. Which is pleasing to _us_. 

We deserve these things, so lets get the good stuff for everyone. Some of it is impossible right now, for boring reasons, but some of the improvements are available, right now, and would lead to more of the larger ones.


anyway, i've got more data than just one walk I went on with my toddler - here's more data. I pull my data from strava,  mix it a bit, and load it to a map, like this:

[https://joshs-mobility-data-54dab943ebba.herokuapp.com/?zoom=17&latlng=39.737619,%20-104.969164](https://joshs-mobility-data-54dab943ebba.herokuapp.com/?zoom=17&latlng=39.737619,%20-104.969164)

If you visit that link, or click this picture, you'll  be able to see a bunch of other travels I've done. Consider this a CV of "attends a lot to road networks", at least enough that we should both keep talking about it!

## The Long Version

I'd like to dramatically improve some specific bits of the neighborhood, especially in line with things like 

> walking around with a toddler in a stroller

and some themes discussed in [Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41104077-invisible-women). It'll be required reading if we work together, maybe. 

I'll at least reference some portions of it as we go.

The main thing is... lets go for a walk! Start in the park?

Charlie, I'd like to discuss some of the ways your properties could be better connected to each other.

As they connect to each other better, they also connect to other, non-cornerstone locations, like Cheesman, or Ideal Market or Trader Joe's or [Denver Botanic Gardens]({{ site.baseurl  }}{% link _posts/2024-06-02-denver-botanic-gardens.md %}). Any of a dozen schools/daycare centers in the area. Parks, playgrounds, open space. 

For so many reasons, "better connections" leads directly to more good things, like money, for both you/a corporate entity, but also the people who move along those improved connections (and people are already moving along these paths), but all sorts of markers of human flourishing go up. "Walkable neighborhoods" are all the rage, and Denver's walkablility is hindered in some really specific ways. 

Good connections are safe and reliable in most regularly-occurring, expectable conditions. There's ways to know when this has occurred, and for reasons that root long before anyone today was born, Denver has pretty shitty connections between places, because they fail, regularly, or at least some users. I'd like to switch something from 

_predictably fails regularly_

to

_so safe and welcoming that, by default, new life has formed in new pockets in the ecosystem_

I have no idea how much data, novel content, passionate story telling, or dollars-and-cents conversations you're interested in having, to spark interest. 

I see your signs everywhere, since I've moved to the Cheesman Park area recently, and my mouth waters at the possibility of working, in a reasonable way, to better connect your buildings (and thus the lives of the people who currently live, or will live, in Cornerstone properties) with local amenities.

My favorite way to talk about things is while walking, either in person or separately, on the phone. I assume you spend time in Denver, would you care to go on a walk from Cheesman park sometime? I live three blocks away, would love to discuss this more.

connectedness has lots of implications across many domains. We'd start by finding ways to improve the experience of people using strollers/joggers, either as the vehicle operator, or the passenger. 

Let's meet up? 

I'm working on a more public post, "paths around denver in which I am interested". ~It's not published yet but i'll update this when it's up.~ its live at [https://josh.works/interested-paths]({{ site.baseurl  }}{% link _posts/2024-06-15-interested-paths.md %}), probably.

_i'm trying to get this in front of Charlie Hogan, I've got my normal array of options üìßüì´üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüéôÔ∏èbut historically I work in software, and `send someone a link to an organic document` is conventional in the industry, takes no time at all, so I am using the same energy to try to attract the attention of Charlie here._[^capture-interest]

[^capture-interest]: there's a few different ways one can 'attract attention'. [one of my favorite webcomics](https://xkcd.com/356/) talks about how ones attention can be derailed by a sufficiently engaging question, and this is an energy I carry around with me all the time. "what's so interesting that it cannot be ignored"_

_believe it or not, this isn't the first time I've done something like this, successfully! Ask me about it if you'd like._

## The long version 

I just moved to the cheesman park neighborhood in February. I've lived in Golden 2015-2022, elsewhere in Denver since then. I'm familiar with the area, but most notably started riding a scooter (like a small motorcycle, but not actually one in crucial ways, also not a motor bike, not a lime scooter, etc).

A long time ago, for reasons not important right now, I started a data gathering project on my own traveling around the city. For example:

[![walk data](images/walking_data_cheesman.jpg)](https://joshs-mobility-data-54dab943ebba.herokuapp.com/?zoom=18&latlng=39.736296,%20-104.96843)

_tap the image above to get a view of very custom data - very specific path data of where I've been while carrying my phone and recording my activity via Strava_

I go on walks, recording them in strava, for example this one. You'll have to request to follow me on Strava to see it. Most people don't have a strava account, even if they do it's unweildy:

[https://www.strava.com/activities/11651893494](https://www.strava.com/activities/11651893494)

Looks like this:

![eden walk](images/eden_trip.jpg)

This particular walk was interesting. I was picking Eden up from Trader Joe's, and walking with her (in her jogger, or not, if she preferred to walk) back to my house, north of cheesman.

I walked myself and her empty stroller there to pick her up, her mom dropped her off, and Eden and I meandered home, at a pace of 30 minutes a mile. 

<todo: update little app so I can show just a single route, like `/12345`?>

I could render just the walk in a link, but currently can show only _all_ of my data. Here's the route, as it looks in my 'app' currently:

![walk with eden](images/return_with_eden.jpg)

There's a lot of data on the map, I happen to know which path I took on this day in question.

a toddler walks, at about 30 minutes per mile, and she walked much of the way. We had such a nice time, as we always do. A few years ago, I took a back injury, and mastered the art of the slow walk. I'm the slowest walker of all my friends. :)

That said, I resent then, that the streets require sometimes _running_ across to feel safe, or to mediate other forms of inconvenience. 

There's so much that could be done to make the streets safer, more vibrant. What is pleasing to a child, which is pleasing to an elderly person, which is pleasing to a tired person, or someone in the heat or the sun. Which is pleasing to _us_. 

We deserve these things, so lets get the good stuff for everyone. Some of it is impossible right now, for boring reasons, but some of the improvements are available, right now, and would lead to more of the larger ones.


anyway, i've got more data than just one walk I went on with my toddler - here's more data. I pull my data from strava,  mix it a bit, and load it to a map, like this:

[https://joshs-mobility-data-54dab943ebba.herokuapp.com/?zoom=17&latlng=39.737619,%20-104.969164](https://joshs-mobility-data-54dab943ebba.herokuapp.com/?zoom=17&latlng=39.737619,%20-104.969164)

If you visit that link, or click this picture, you'll  be able to see a bunch of other travels I've done. Consider this a CV of "attends a lot to road networks", at least enough that we should both keep talking about it!

## The Long Version

I'd like to dramatically improve some specific bits of the neighborhood, especially in line with the experience of all parties in a situation like:

> walking around with a toddler in a stroller

If one gets these things right, one happens to also have gotten a bunch of other details right. 

Some of the concepts are discussed in the book [Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41104077-invisible-women). If we end up working together, I would get you a copy and reference it sometimes. It would sound like:

> in chapter 8 (page 156), the author talks about feminine-coded trip-chaining, in service of elderly and young. A small improvement that can be made for the residents and non-residents passing by {location} in {specific use case} might be {specific intervention}. What do you think?

I'll at least reference some portions of it as we go.

The main thing is... lets go for a walk! Start in the park?

## The original 'email' as I drafted it up real quick

Charlie, I'd like to discuss some of the ways your properties could be better connected to each other.

As they connect to each other better, they also connect to other, non-Cornerstone locations, like Cheesman, or Ideal Market or Trader Joe's or Safewae or [the Botanic Gardens]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2024-06-02-denver-botanic-gardens.md %}). 

Any of a dozen schools/daycare centers in the area. Parks, playgrounds, open space. 

For so many reasons, "better connections" leads directly to more good things, like money, for both you/a corporate entity, but also the people who move along those improved connections. all sorts of markers of human flourishing go up. 

I'm claiming that I can directly 'engineer' the creation of "Walkable neighborhoods", for a fraction of the time and effort 'the city' can, using nothing but tools and labor you've already paid for.

'walkable neighborhoods" are all the rage, but the way Denver's doing it ("complete streets", their "big sidewalk initiative") is unfruitful at best.

Denver's walkability is shit, but I want to fix it, and I think you'd prefer to live in a neighborhood where this issue was fixed, so I'd want to do that too.

Currently, the streets are not managed adequately, but it takes surprisingly little pressure, if it's correctly applied, to get dramatic improvements. The smaller the intervention, the easier it is to accomplish. [consider this interview with Wes Marshall, just published _Killed by a Traffic Engineer_, lives here in Denver. He worked/works with DOTI and teaches at CU Denver](https://www.youtube.com/live/26LuHqFQ0bY).

Good connections are safe and reliable in most regularly-occurring, expectable conditions. There's ways to know when this has occurred, and for reasons that root long before anyone today was born, Denver has inefficient connections between places.

I don't know the best way to spark interest for you.

I see Cornerstone signs everywhere, since I've moved to the Cheesman Park area recently, and my mouth waters at the possibility of working, in a reasonable way, to better connect your buildings (and thus the lives of the people who currently live, or will live, in Cornerstone properties) with local amenities.

My favorite way to talk about things is while walking, either in person or separately, on the phone. I assume you spend time in Denver, would you care to go on a walk from Cheesman park sometime? I live three blocks away, would love to discuss this more.

connectedness has lots of implications across many domains. We'd start by finding ways to improve the experience of people using strollers/joggers, either as the vehicle operator, or the passenger. 

Let's meet up? 

I'm working on a more public post, "paths around denver in which I am interested". <strike>It's not published yet but i'll update this when it's up.</strike> its live at [https://josh.works/interested-paths]({{ site.baseurl  }}{% link _posts/2024-06-15-interested-paths.md %}).

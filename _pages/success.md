Thanks for purchasing this guide!

Check your email; you should have an email from `thompsonjoshd@gmail.com` in your inbox soon. Unfortunately, the tool I use to send emails can take up to 5 min to get an email out the door, so you _might_ have an email from me (`thompsonjoshd@gmail.com`) immediately, it might take five minutes.

It'll have instructions on how to download everything, as well as additional information about working through the material, and more.

Obviously, if you have any questions, or don't see your email after a few minutes, just shoot me an email.

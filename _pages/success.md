Thanks for purchasing my guide!

I'm _thrilled_ that you did that. I'm pretty confident that you'll be thrilled with what you purchased, but I'm honored and humbled that you've chosen to give _me_, this random guy on the internet, your hard-earned cash. 

That said, in exchange for this money, you'll be getting huge amounts of your time back, so I think it's a fair trade. ðŸ˜€

Check your email; you should have an email from `thompsonjoshd@gmail.com` in your inbox soon. The tool I use to send emails checks for purchases - and sends the emails - every fifteen minutes, so you will have an email from me (`thompsonjoshd@gmail.com`) between now and fifteen minutes from now.

Anyway, this email will have the course, as well as additional information about working through the material, and more.

Obviously, if you have any questions, or don't see your email after fifteen minutes, just shoot me an email. I'll sort it out.

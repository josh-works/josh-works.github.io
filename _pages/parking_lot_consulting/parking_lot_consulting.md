# Signs your parking (lot) is broken

- not enough spaces at certain times
- dangerous situations loading/unloading vehicles
- customers cruising (looking) for spaces
- no(t enough) parking for staff/contractors at certain times
- and more

I'm _obsessed_ with parking lots and everything about them, and I'd like to help yours work better.

For $1500/mo, I'll start helping you with yours.

It's a mix of consultation and analysis, obviously. And then making small changes, and deciding how we like things. 

Rinse, and repeat. 

Here's some of my tiktoks about some parking lots:

Critically, I'll explain how some of these classes of problems are _a solved problem_ in some places, and thus are solvable here, in your specific context.

# Misc

From [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/10z9a8t/rock_climb_gym_closing/j82fpcr/), about Movement Baker:

> True. Itâ€™s been insane since December. Circling around the parking lot for 5 minutes to find a spot is no bueno.


# Potential harms of mismanaged parking

- lots of frustration around arriving/departing
- possibly less customers
- dangerous interactions between classes of vehicles. Near-misses, etc.
- things seem worse when it rains or snows
- sometimes might feel dark and unsafe, but othertimes super busy

_I'm giving this talk the same way I present information in a "professional" setting:_

1.  _I give as much information before the meeting as possible. (Can the meeting be avoided with more information sharing? If yes, share more information)_
2.  _I give everyone time to review the notes I have prepared._
3.  _Summarize, summarize, summarize._
4.  _Lead with the important bits. _

_I work at [Litmus, Inc](https://litmus.com/meet-the-team). It's a Boston-based software company that is a [really cool place to work](https://litmus.com/blog/were-a-2014-best-places-to-work-winner). We're growing ~50%/year (did $15.4mm in business last year. Growing quickly. I was employee 31, we're about to pass employee #50\. Competent employees/staff, good pay, 6 weeks paid vacation, good equipment, and most importantly, we're a remote-friendly company. (that's the biggest benefit to me)._

_I want to share information that may help some of you end up in really satisfying jobs in a few years. I shamelessly promote the benefits of software and the internet. You can work in "progressive" work environments and do things that impact tens of thousands of people. There are certainly other good jobs out there, but many have more red tape or barriers to entry._

# Your Second Job is the First One that Matters

**tl****;****dr**** ([definition](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl%3Bdr)): Don't stress about the next few years, or your first "real" job. _It doesn't matter that much. _Only two things really matter:**

1.  **What you do with the opportunity you have**
2.  **What you do outside of work**

By the time you are looking for your second job, you can collect much evidence that you're skilled, competent, enjoyable to work with, and effective at what you do. You also might start having a small clue about _what you want to do._

Exhibit A, Josh's working career:

1.  Part time @ climbing gym
2.  Full time @ climbing gym
3.  Fired from climbing gym
4.  Mish-mash of things while unemployed. Notable projects: "consulting", customer development, process optomization.
5.  Part-time customer support for not-very-good [web platform](https://www.razoo.com/)

**Build/participate in Community**

1.  Find people on Twitter that seem to be good at what they do. Talk with them a little.
2.  Join the "GCC People Building Interesting Things" [Slack](https://slack.com/) group, started by [Jordan Koschei](https://twitter.com/jordankoschei). (Send him or I an email/tweet)

PS Some of you are going to watch/listen and say "hm, interesting" and never think about this again. A few of you will take action. Be part of the latter group. The world is run by people who take unusual steps to secure good things. It's not nearly as competitive as you think.

Hi Sean, Hi Moses,

I've followed both of you on Twitter for a while, and wanted to drop something of a letter in your respective email, or DM you on Twitter/X, but have found the constraints of that format + the inability to edit it + a bunch of other constraints to be overly limiting.

I'll say a bit more about me and why I am the best person to work with on what I'm proposing, but first, lets get to the proposal. 

You both are _firmly_ rooted in real estate. Sean, you develop commercially, buying land and building on it, and Moses, you buy (and hold) properties. You both seem to be skilled at what you do. 

There is a problem in the industry, I suspect you both see it:
1. The financing is getting wonky, especially with non-historically-low interest rates
2. The legal regimes conventional to your respective cities (Los Angeles, Minneapolis) are *ahem* sclerotic at best. 

I mentioned a conspiracy, but before I get there, let me explain what I'm hoping to achieve with this conspiracy:

- More housing
- more _units_ of housing
- cheaper price-per-square-foot of housing
- cheaper price-per-unit of housing
- less street noise
- less vehicle emissions (tailpipe, brake dust, tire rubber microplastics)
- more business for businesses
- cheaper dollars-per-square-foot commercial rents
- more individual businesses
- more 'outdoor rooms'
- more plants, greenery
- less impermiable surface 
- more walking
- less four-wheeled vehicles
- more two-wheeled vehicles (bicycles and motor scooters)
- more generational wealth

> God damn josh, that's a tall order. How do you think you'll accomplish this?

Well, first, I want to talk about some of the barriers to these kinds of things. 

## The biggest problem: The Legacy, and complicated constellation of systems, created by Robert Moses

Lets talk about Robert Moses - he's arguably the most politically powerful person who's ever lived, and he shaped nearly every aspect of the modern world. I'd recommend you read the pulitzer prize winning biography about him, [The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of NYC](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1111.The_Power_Broker). I wrote a bit more about him here: [https://josh.works/robert-moses](https://josh.works/robert-moses). It's a huge book, and if we work together, you'll both receive annotated copies for your own reference from me. üòÅ

He was a complicated person. He was also singlehandedly responsible for how roads got built in America. He also popularized a specific zoning regime that became known as 'euclidean zoning'. He also invented the federal highway administration, and directed most of it's spending. He built parks, and highways, and morphed public authorities into a 4th branch of government, modeled after himself. He built highway after highway after highway, and all of the bridges connecting NYC with the surrounding area. He hated the kinds of people that used trains, and black people, and jewish people, and puerto ricans. 

He also never learned to drive a car - he had a full-time _team_ of chaouffers manning a fleet of vehicles to take him from wherever he was to wherever he wanted to go. He ruined the careers of hundreds of people who dared oppose him, at all. His hold on power was absolute. Powerful people who's names you know (FDR, La Guardia) tried to dislodge him from power, and failed. If you watch the opening scene of Edward Norton's [Motherless Brooklyn](https://www.amazon.com/Motherless-Brooklyn-Edward-Norton/dp/B07ZP8K398), you'll see a film adaptation of the opening scene of _The Power Broker_. It's worth the ten minutes. 

He also died a long time ago, and most of the people operating his systems today don't even know his name. 

Anyway, without a good causal understanding of how things got the way they did (design reviews, setbacks, floor-area-ratio maximums, maximum dwelling units per acre, set backs, prohibitions on commercial/residential overlap, parking minimums, apartment size minimums, height restrictions, and so much more) its hard to chart a path out of that sticky mess. 

There's other problems, but most of the shit in land use is downstream of Robert Moses. He was wildly popular around the world, and a supremacist, so his ideas got spread not just around the USA but around the world. 

## The antidotes

So, there's some things that need to be fixed, which are not just reactionary to robert moses, but need to take into account the good things that should have been built, but got cannabolized and scavenged and squelched by him and his supporters. 

### A Theory of Repair

There's a few different directions to go in the repair of this kind of damage. 

First, Christopher Alexander. He wrote a book called [A Pattern Language](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79766.A_Pattern_Language).

It's a heavy duty book, but he argues that problems in the physical world can be solved in the physical world, and recognizing and categorizing problems (and solutions) as 'patterns' allows a cohesive, vernacular, layman-friendly form of development to occur. He also is the godfather of object-oriented software development, which _also_ relies on patterns. Me, being interested in architecture and software, have the worlds biggest crush on him. Sadly, he died recently.

Here's a twitter thread about him: [https://twitter.com/meekaale/status/1710368026988580941](https://twitter.com/meekaale/status/1710368026988580941)

### Importing social technology around tiny rail networks, sane parking management, and improved legal systems

#### The Rail piece

There's a [tiny little rail system](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C9zQ78hKxvitXuHV7) in New Zealand built originally to move excavated clay from one spot on some very hilly terrain to the landowners kiln. 

I want to bring this exact same kind of rail experimentally to a single place in America. When I'm successful, we'll have the skeleton of a inner-city rail network and a ton of useful experience. 

To sneak this by the local municipal planners, it'll be called 'an aid for trash collection, to move it from one part of the lot to wherever the bulk collection gets done'.

As you may have heard, it's hard to build rail networks in America, so we might as well just go do it ourselves. It's no harder than any other reasonabe thing, it's simply uncommon. Reality is surprisingly complicated, but I believe a few people, some time, some budget, and a few phone calls can make it start happening.

- tiny gage rail around the property
- calling it trash collection and materials movement. More 'mining cart' vibe, less 'street car/subway'

#### The parking piece

regardless of if you're developing with parking minimums (the municipal equivalent of believing the earth is flat, but whatever) or without, i'd like you to both plan on ushering in modern parking management.

Donald Shoup wrote a book titled [the high cost of free parking](https://www.amazon.com/High-Cost-Parking-Updated-Edition/dp/193236496X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1332084228&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=markeurban-20&linkId=65aeac5942c99b794876bb2d2dc32bb0), which i'll ALSO send you annotated copies of, if we start working together. It's a huge book, not worth reading in detail, but he outlines the problems of 'free' parking (it isn't) and strategies for change. 

Basically, to manage your parking appropriately, regardless of how much you have, requires three things. To a municipality, the steps would be:

1. Set the price accordingly for on-street parking (it'll float and rise based on demand)
2. Spend the money directly adjacent to where it's being collected (on improvments. Lighting, street-scapes, sidewalk improvements, whatever)
3. Eliminate off-street parking requirements

Municipalities seem to have their heads stuck in the sand about this, so i think it'll be up to the private developers (you two, eventually others) to make moves on this. 

Here's how I conceptualize this working:

1. know the exact number of parking spots (also, separate parking into car parking, bike parking, motorscooter parking)
2. Price it appropriately, so there is always at least 5-10% of the parking spaces available
3. Broadcast the availability of the parking and make it discoverable throughout a one-block radius

Example: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Where shall we park tonight?<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Utrecht?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Utrecht</a> <a href="https://t.co/8d3HLfdkZl">pic.twitter.com/8d3HLfdkZl</a></p>&mdash; Jere M. (@JerppaM) <a href="https://twitter.com/JerppaM/status/1714688386626122218?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 18, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

The parking piece could also someday be spun into it's own company, perhaps. Obviously once you and your properties get this piece sorted, it would deliver so much value we'd hope to see it spread to other people.

I don't care much right now about 'company structure'. Maybe it's easiest to think of spinning up the rail network and parking fix components as separate companies, and if they achieve a modicum of success maybe they become quite valuable. Whatever makes sense and lets us get started with as little friction as possible works for me. 

#### the legal regime piece

ok, here's why I led with 'conspiracy'. 

If you read original zoning law documents, it's hard to escape the fact that the inventors of the legal regimes _openly hated non-white people_ and built the legal regimes to institute a certain form of social control. 

They eliminated all abilities for 'ethnic neighborhoods' to exist. They openly talked about how to solve 'the jewish problem', 'the itialian problem', 'the black problem' in cities.

For just a cursory example, consider [The Color of Law: A Forgotten History of How Our Government Segregated America](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32191706-the-color-of-law). You'll both get annotated copies of all of these books, if we start working together. 

Additionally, a flip through [The Slaughter of Cities: Urban Renewal as Ethnic Cleansing](https://www.fidelitypress.org/book-products/the-slaughter-of-cities) leaves one nearly in tears. 

I want to draw inspiration from [Conspiracy: Peter Thiel, Hulk Hogan, Gawker, and the Anatomy of Intrigue](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36681909-conspiracy?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=ECttXNLfzj&rank=1), and work quietly, silently, towards a very specific goal. It won't stay quiet and silent forever, but for starters, to take down an evil, odious system, it takes coordination and manouvering. 

I don't want to invent anything 'new', whole-cloth. I simply want to 'import' better norms. My inspiration is [Legal Systems Very Different from Ours](https://www.amazon.com/Legal-Systems-Very-Different-Ours/dp/1793386722).

I've got big goals, obviously, but my gosh this is fun to work on. I'd like y'all to partner with me to move in this direction.



# Conclusion


Well, by myself, I won't. But with a small, oddly motivated coalition, and some time, nearly any obstacle can be overcome. 




## FAQ

### Who the heck are you, Josh? 

Good question. I've done a bunch of different things over the years. Chronologically, I worked for the COO of a climbing gym company (earth treks) while expanding a climbing gym in Rockville, MD to what was then the largest climbing gym in the world. That was a quite formative experience, and made me want to never do commercial construction again. (There's only so many hours one wants to run sawzalls, welders, chop saws, etc.)

I then jumped into the world of software, and ended up doing a nice string of customer support jobs, then customer 'success' and enterprise sales. I was good at it, liked it, it enabled me to travel the world while working, which was an expansive and generative experience.

After watching how nice the actual software _developers_ got treated, I wanted to be a better-treated cog in a machine, so I got into actual software development, 'slinging code' professionally. That was fine and fun for a while. Solved lots of interesting problems, often around 'scaling systems'. I regularly-enough saw order-of-magnitude improvements by layering a few reasonable improvements down, and believe deep in my soul that order-of-magnitude improvements can be had in other domains.

I've always had what some have called 'a strong ethical compass', so when I started getting into learning about the origins of the American form of zoning, land use regimes, mobility network engineering, I was ruined. (There's lots of supremacy thinking ennervating the whole system. Ethnic cleansing, social control, colonialism, etc.)

I became friends with some movers and shakers in the space, and then my then-wife and I purchased a house in Golden, Colorado, and I was fucking wrecked. I learned the kind of access to city planning officials afforded to privileged white-passing homeowners, and turned it up to 11. I learned their systems quite well, I basically spent a year farting around with making the city a less-horrible place, and was *completely unsuccessful*. (The KKK used to burn crosses on a promentant hill overlooking the city, and, well, things have not changed much since then)

There's a lot more on this website and others going way deeper into all that, maybe we'll talk about it some day. Here's a starting point: [https://josh.works/full-copy-of-1922-atlanta-zone-plan](https://josh.works/full-copy-of-1922-atlanta-zone-plan)


### Why did you write this as a web page instead of something like a DM?

A few reasons. 

1. I imagine you both get plenty of DMs, so it's a noisy place. 
2. I often write something, then edit it, see how it looks, come back to it a day later, make more changes, etc. I can do that easily on my own website, it's harder to do with a twitter DM.
3. The curiosity. If you're like me, seeing my own name in the URL of a web page generates a little interest, at least enough for the click. If you're reading these words, it looks like it worked!
4. I usually pay my rent with software development, and this kind of workflow is quite conventional/familiar to me, as a hold-over from that world. 

### I'm interested, perhaps, but also don't know you at all

This is understandably unconventional. I propose that the unconventionality be counted in my favor. 

For next steps, I'd say lets do a phone call, to do a bit more of a vibe check. 

I basically want you to both pay me a reasonable going rate for 'consultation' around this space, and i'll tell you what else I need. (Executive support, some budget for whatever project we pick off first). It'll be a lose arrangement. I won't be your employee, I'll be a consultant, and we'll all have some plausible deniability for what everyone is doing.

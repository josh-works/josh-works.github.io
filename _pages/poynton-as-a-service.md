## Lets Work Together? 

You and I have possibly already swapped emails, phone calls, possibly had coffee/drinks together, Zoom calls, etc. As a result of our prior conversations, we think some of the intersections around here (this part of Denver) could be rather a bit better, in the style of a 'copy/paste' from Poynton, UK:

Because I'm ~lazy~ an incrementalist, I propose it be done _incrementally_, starting with cleaning and some basics, making some use of space already available. 


In [this thing I wrote elsewhere](https://zoningverydifferentthanours.substack.com/p/interlude-a-pattern-of-repair-episode) I talk more about Poynton, but it's worth the 15 minutes. Consider it part of a 'pitch', context setting in broad brushes, what seems to be far and away the most available type of infrastructure improvement that could be had. 

Next, I want to propose that the 'end shape' that's achieved could be 'sketched out' with something like traffic cones, for starters, and bags covering the traffic lights and signs. Dot the entrances with MUTCD-approved signs that say "new traffic patterns ahead", and it's fully legal and compliant by all of today's road engineering codes. 

In [https://zoningverydifferentthanours.substack.com/p/traffic-congestion-as-solvable-part-072](https://zoningverydifferentthanours.substack.com/p/traffic-congestion-as-solvable-part-072) I try to outline some screenshot type things of what could be done, again, starting with _just orange traffic cones_, though quickly able to be upgraded and made beautiful.

I also think the intersection could be fixed with a less total overhaul than poynton needed. That was a heavy duty project, I think it could be done with many fewer tons of waste removed or new material brought in. 

## Pollution

this plan would reduce many types of pollution:

- noise pollution (acceleration)
- noise pollution (breaking)
- exhaust
- brake dust
- tire microplastics

The end result is obviously safe. I'm hesitant to include pictures of the specific unsafety of the intersection at park & colefax, but it's easy to imagine as 'standard bad'. Also, this part of Colefax once was very much a "place", it's suitable to receive this sort of treatment. 

## Persons that might be a good fit

- owner/operators responsible for things in this part of denver. The more proximate to the intersections, or the more you use the intersections (in any mode), perhaps the more it matters, not that your involvement needs to change. Just... I use this space a lot, thus it feels like it matters a lot to me. 

- people who want to sponsor the work getting done. Some of you hire people to solve problems for you, and could imagine hiring someone or something to accomplish this project. I'd like that to be me, in a very specific way, which we'll talk about. 

so, discuss? let me know. If you have this page, we possibly already are in touch. joshthompson@hey.com, if helpful.

## Why I'm writing this

From [this HackerNews thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23793216)

> Khan Academy continually gets held up as a great resource for online courses across the age spectrum for math related subjects. With the continuing pandemic continuing to grow in the US and schools not really sure how to handle things, the GF and I are looking into other options.
> 
> Is there a recommended resource that gives unbiased (as possible) reviews for middle school (7-8th grade) curriculum? Searching these days really doesn't bring up quality, just options one has to comb through.


Someone left this answer:

> I'm a teacher with 15 years of experience and an edtech entrepreneur. I've reviewed thousands of secular homeschool programs for accuracy and quality. We're working on developing unbiased reviews of all of our favorites, but here are a few great all-in-one programs to get you started. All mastery-based, all secular and aligned with state standards. In general, these also combine hands-on projects with online learning, involve little to no prep time and minimal parent involvement in learning, with some element of personalization.

> I'm confused by the current approach to schooling in the U.S. As functioning adults, society rewards folks who can identified unanswered problems and come up with solutions. Meanwhile education focuses on drilling facts. In formal education, not including extra curriculars, the first time I see learners exposed to unanswered questions is graduate school.
> 
> I feel one of the best ways to learn is to practice the thing you are actually going to be doing. It's odd that we never practice answering novel questions. I.E. introducing the unanswered questions of the past, the context that lead us to asking them, and the approaches humans took to solving them. Do you know of any home-school programs that include something like this? 

This begs a good question. 

What are we educating children _for_? 

That's a contentious question, and not one I'm willing to even try to answer, though I have a lot of opinions. 

Instead, here's a rough "curriculum" I might hand to my kid as older than a ten year old. I'm writing this document up because I've got a lot of friends who have kids who are fretting about what they'll do next year because of Covid. 

Go back to school? not go back to school? Do school from zoom?

I personally find all of these questions mostly irrelevant, as "traditional school" is, broadly, harmful to children and educators. (hot take, I know.)

Reflecting on my own time when I was in middleschool and highschool, I thought the world was far smaller and more boring than it actually is. I just never had anyone point out the interesting opportunities I could have pursued. 

Next, I don't think _most_ adults in America have the same lense on the world as I do. I'm young-ish (31), and I straddle a few communities, like:
- Liberal software development crowds
- Conservative Christian republican communities
- high-performing athletic communities (rather accomplished rock climbers)
- Rationalist/effective altruism communities


------------------

Comments I'd share with highschoolers and a past version of me:

### Learning something you don't want to learn is between "useless" and "harmful"

### You will be forced to comply with the norms and expectations of those in authority

This was my constant struggle in highschool. Play the game as well as you must until you're out of the house and independent. 

### If you can convince those who have power over you to get your GED then drop out of highschool, do so

### College is a catastrophic waste of time and money. Embrace the constraint of imagining a future where you're successful without college

Most people that are 40 years old and up have an affinity to college. This is reasonable, based on their experience, but the world had changed dramatically since they were in school.

As you're repeatedly told to go to college, thank them for their care for you (they want good things for you!) and then plan on not going to college. Don't make a big stink about it. You can say "I've not decided what college to go to" or "I've not decided what major I might choose" which allows you to be technically truthful, but they will infer from your words that you're going to college, and they'll stop pestering you. 

### Start writing things down. Write online. 

### I have mixed feelings on twitter... probably avoid?

### Most people who read this will be or have been addicted to porn. Start planning on breaking that addiction.

Read this: [A Science-Based Case for Ending the Porn Epidemic](https://amgreatness.com/2019/12/15/a-science-based-case-for-ending-the-porn-epidemic/) (from December, 2019. Modern porn is not your parent's dirty magazines)

### Most of the world treats you like a child. You're not, but you don't yet have the power to force them to respect you. 

Read the following books:

- [The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36556202-the-coddling-of-the-american-mind)
- [How to Raise an Adult: Break Free of the Overparenting Trap and Prepare Your Kid for Success](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23168823-how-to-raise-an-adult)

> Josh, these books are not written to me, they're written to my parents

Correct. Your parents probably have not and will not read these books, so you're going to have to do their work for them. 

Read those books, then read:

[Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/313605.Getting_to_Yes)

This is something I desperately wish I knew in highschool. Your parents (and mine!) are as uncertain about the world as you are. They have strong opinions about how things should be done, but they have far more power than you do. So, read this book on negotiation (It's widely regarded as the best book on the topic) and then start negotiating with your parents.

The key piece of this negotiation is:

> If you can help them get what you want, you can probably have a lot more of what you want. 

So, they want a child that seems responsible, respectful, competent, driven, etc. You can demonstrate all of these traits to them by _effectively negotiating for your life to be more the way you want it to be_. 

This advice might initially cause parents consternation, as it seems like I'm circumnavigating their authority by talking straight to you, and giving you tools to "manage" them. 

Eh. The world is an unfriendly place, and ultimately this advice will promote a healthy relationship between you and then.

### Start studying the general topic of "emotional intelligence"

Observing, understanding, and influencing your own emotions will go far farther to influence your overall quality of life than nearly any other topic/accomplishment/product you will encounter in your life.

Rich and successful people regularly feel such despair they dull their life with drugs, alcohol, sensation-seeking behaviors, and suicide. 

Conversely, there are persons in the midst of such tragic circumstances literally nothing about their life seems desirable except the joy and peace they feel.

This contrast is important. Why is it that poor people can be happy, and rich people take their own life?

Until you understand the implications of the contrast between these perspectives, be concerned, and don't commit too hard to someone else's plan for your life. 

### The world is distinctly unfair

### Injustice abounds. You've already experienced this. It's worse than any of us can fully appreciate.

### If you're not content with your body composition, "calories in and calories out" is a discredited view of controlling weight.

Read:

- [The Case Against Sugar]
- [James Clear Intermittent Fasting]
- [Nerd Fitness Intermittent Fasting]

### An overattachment to "stuff" may well ruin your finances and your life

### Figuring out how to cook for yourself is surprisingly challenging

I feel like I've finally figured out all my meals, tolerably well, in my 31st year.

I always felt like I was an idiot for not knowing how to grocery shop efficiently and make cook well.

I adopted intermittent fasting when I was 25, and went from three daily meals to two. (Lunch and dinner). That saved me a _lot_ of daily struggle around food.

I also eat the exact same thing every day for lunch. Once a week I fill a gallon tupperware container with chopped veggies.

- Carrots
- Sweet potatoes
- onions
- peppers
- garlic
- anything else

I scoop a bunch of it into a pan, dump in a lot of coconut oil and olive oil, saut√©e until soft, then add five or six eggs. 

It's easy and quick, and you can find the necessary ingredients anywhere in the world.

I also generally don't snack. I eat lunch, I eat dinner, and I eat almost nothing else. 

Next, dinners... are hard. I felt shame about how hard it was for me to reliably plan for and grocery shop for dinners. 

So, learn from people that seem to easily prepare healthy food for dinner. With a little bit of attentive work in this direction. Your health and your finances are in the balance.

### Most people around you are bad with their money, so try to not be influenced by them

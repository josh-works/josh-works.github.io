# Bike Tours of Golden with Josh!

I nerd out hard about urban mobility infrastructure, and the built urban form. I can see it most clearly from a bike, and it's easiest to explain from a bike as well.

So, I'm conducting "academic infrastructure-related bike tours of Golden". 

It mostly likes like "riding around Golden with friends". 

I've been doing bike tours of Golden with friends. These are not "normal" bike tours, however you define them. 

- We don't need mountain bikes
- we'll probably drink a beer or coffee at some point
- You'll hear about some obscure books
- I'll point out a lot of stuff that is beautiful and interesting

I do the "tours" because I enjoy biking around Golden, and this page is to help me have an excuse to do more of them.

I like to highlight some aspects of Golden that most people miss. It brings me great joy, and I like to share that joy with others. 

Here's a heatmap of my biking around Golden:

Here's my recent rides.[^strava]

[^strava]: I apologize for the ü•îquality. I'll get an [_actual_ Strava API integration set up soon](https://github.com/josh-works/strava_run_polylines_osm), so I can display the activity in a reasonable way.

### What participants have said:

> Wow. I would never have noticed all of this.

> Also would great fun to do another bike tour. You should start charging for your tours. 

> I'm ruined, Josh. After wandering around Golden with you, I've started to see it (and other cities) with a whole new perspective, and I cannot un-see it.

Here's a few sample rides of what the bike tour might look like: 

Going forward, I'll make sure to record the actual bike tours, and I'll include pictures _from_ the tour.

I'll get actual photos from the rides added at some point. I tend to not have my phone out too much when biking around, as you might imagine. 



### Schedule A Private Bike Tour of Golden

I do "Private" tours, in that it'll just be me and you, and anyone else you want to invite along. (The more the merrier!) Maybe some day I'll do scheduled larger-group tours, but not yet.

Make a payment, and I'll email you to coordinate a good time, working around our respective schedules and weather and such. (It's 6 degrees with 6" of snow outside as I type these words. ü•∂)

### The Private Tour + Drinks

The first principle of selling _anything_ is to give people options. I love to grab a ‚òïÔ∏è, üçª, or üç∑ before, during, or after a bike around Golden. 

Book this option, and I'll make sure the tour includes a stop by at least one of Golden's many coffee shops and breweries. First drink is on me!

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### How long will the tour be?

Depends on your preferences. At least three miles, less than ten. Budget an hour if we're _just_ biking, or two hours if biking + drinks. Golden has great options for drinks and food, and I'd love to show you some of them!

#### When will the tour be?

This _also_ depends on your preferences. There's something magical about biking around Golden at night, and I've done it many times, so we're not even constrained by normal daylight hours. Could be a weekend afternoon, or a week-day afternoon, or a weekday evening. Or a morning. 

#### Do I need my own bike

If you have one, bring it! (and a helmet, and ideally a light or two for your bike, especially if we're riding around at night.) 

I have two extra bikes, both rescues from a dumpster, and I'm getting them into good repair. I will gladly let you ride the bike I usually ride around, which is the nicest bike I've ever owned, but it was a $150 find on Craigslist, so if you're a "bike person", you won't be impressed. 

#### Where will we meet?

Somewhere in Golden. We'll finish somewhere in Golden, too. Maybe we'll meet at my house, or we'll meet downtown, or at the Creek.

#### What if I have to reschedule?

If it snows, or it gets super cold, or your schedule changes, we can easily reschedule. I live in Golden and bike around it all the time (during the day and at night). It's rather difficult to inconvenience me, and rescheduling a bike tour isn't inconvenient at all.

#### What happens when I pay?

I'll send you an email, we'll figure out a good time, a place to meet, and we'll bike around for an hour or so. It'll be a bike tour unlike anything you've ever had. üòÅ

#### I have a question you've not answered. How do I ask it?

Shoot me an email (`joshthompson@hey.com`) or send a Twitter DM: [@josh_works](https://twitter.com/josh_works)

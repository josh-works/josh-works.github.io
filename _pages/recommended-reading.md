I've read many books over the years. Thousands. Here's a few that I find myself referencing/recommending often. Periodically, I refresh this list. It's changed over the years years.

_the list you are about to read is heavily reworked, based off this older list: [josh.works/recommended-reading-original-list]({{ site.baseurl  }}{% link _posts/2018-05-17-recommended_reading_original_list.md %})_

These are the books I cannot un-read, which shape me today. Many of the books are "difficult". I often tell people I'm a slut for books - I'll read any book, for any reason, and if I "like" it is almost a complete afterthought. The real question is - can I glean something of value from it? Can I sift and find something, _anything_ that is helpful to me? That increases my understanding or imagination, or is an engaging-enough story?

If I can, I'm pleased with the experience. I can read English texts quickly, by the way. 

I don't sound out individual words, nor do I sound _any_ words out, in my head, as I read. I also experience my own inner world similar to the author of [this post about aphantasia](https://www.facebook.com/notes/2862324277332876/). I read for content and information without a single image passing through my imagination. I only recently learned that this is not the same experience everyone has. I can capture large fractions of lines of text 'at once' and process a page quite fast. Not everyone reads quickly, obviously. Literacy and hyper-literacy are... complicated. 

Anyway, plunge into a book only if reading seems pleasant-enough to make the effort worthwhile. No sweat either way, you'll get a sense of some things just by surfing book titles, I'm 'just' surfacing a list, one or two of which might catch your eye, and if it does and you click through to amazon or good reads or the library and find a review that seems ü§ìüßê and you have a nice few hours of reading, congrats to us both. üéâ

I also used a [Kindle Paperwhite](https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-16-GB-adjustable/dp/B09TMZKQR7) with a nice magnetic cover (easy to transport, read while waiting around, I carry it in my purse/hip bag/fanny pack), and am pretty good with my library card/Libby, and enjoy reading for sometimes purely dissociative purposes. 

This isn't a homework list, consider it to be a menu of potentially delicious entries, and IF any of them seem suitably energizing to you, choose them.

## General food things

Did you know mitochondria constitute _half_ the dry weight of your body? The little high-school biochem drawings are also wrong - for some cells, mitochondria make up 2/3rds non-nucleic volume! I wasn't aware.

- [Tripping Over The Truth](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/23496164)
- [The Case Against Sugar](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29874881-the-case-against-sugar)
- [Eating Animals](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6604712-eating-animals)
- [It Starts With The Egg](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21782260-it-starts-with-the-egg)

For me, the grand conclusion of most of these books: 

most days I mostly eat some sauted mushrooms, brocoli, zucchini, sardines, eggs, almonds, s&p, evoo, kimchi, sometime in the early afternoon, first meal of the day, then do 'whatever' for dinner. Black coffee or espresso, almond milk or heavy cream if needed for taste. Tea, or [veggie Bouillon cubes](https://www.amazon.com/Not-Beef-Not-Chickn-Edward-Sons-Bouillon/dp/B01BNUYTTS?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&psc=1&smid=A1O9I0PFIHK5TL). 

Salmon is the 'other' meat I eat. I eat almost zero other meat, and have not purchased for myself anything but salmon and sardines for years. 

I cook on a lodge 10" cast iron pan with [this very specific dexter-russell 4"x2.5" pancake turner](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015R7P6O/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1), and because I use adequate/tons of olive oil, the pan is always oiled and cleanable with the metal turner. 

I can scrape it clean/flat and never even run it under water. It lives on the stove-top, I cook once or twice a day in it, and never clean it or have to put it away. It is _extremely_ low-effort, low-demand, and delicious. I've cooked for dozens of people over the years, most report to enjoy my cooking.

## Denver/Regional things

I lived in Golden 2015-2022. Even ran for city council in 2017, then did another round of prodding at the machine, informed mostly by Robert Moses, in 2021, after buying a house there late in 2020. Stories are fascinating, here's some specific to Denver, Colorado, and Golden:

- [Citizen Coors: A Grand Family Saga of Business, Politics, and Beer](https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Coors-Family-Business-Politics/dp/0060959460)
- [Hooded Empire: The Ku Klux Klan in Colorado](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3101191-hooded-empire) was hard to get, library didn't have a copy, used prospector + interlibrary loan to get it. 



## Housing as a regime of social control

These two links are not books but desperately worth the read.

It's a little icky when so much of success can be tied closely to subtle interactions with banking systems 'going well'. 

1. ["The 30-Year Mortgage is an Intrinsically Toxic Product" by Byrne Hobart](https://byrnehobart.medium.com/the-30-year-mortgage-is-an-intrinsically-toxic-product-200c901746a), 
2. [`Government Policy, Housing, and the Origins of Securitization, 1780 - 1968` by Sarah Lehman Quinn](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7sq3f6xk) tells the story of 'regimes and attempted regimes of social control via housing<>financial policy`, which puts many of this century‚Äôs financial tooling developments in an interesting context.


## 13 Books related to trauma, self-concept, and existing in the western world

I read the canon of any given topic that climbs high enough on my list of priorities to learn about. Here's the ones that keep coming up in conversation, or my own mind.

You can get all/most of these books on [Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby) (a library app) and can send them for free to your [kindle paperwhite](https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-adjustable-Ad-Supported/dp/B08KTZ8249), anywhere in the world. Or torrent the .epubs via piratebay, and use [calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) to convert/transfer them to your device. 

If your library doesn't have the book, google `[library system] request book form`. I've asked Jefferson County Library Systems to add many books over the years, and I many were easily added. One didn't have an ebook option, and I didn't re-request for a physical version, and sometimes if they think it won't get read often enough they might say no. 

So, you could drop a few hundred dollars on books at the high end, or possibly spend not a single dollar on any of these. I like physical copies of books, sometimes, and will mark them up, sometimes quite heavily. But lots to be gained from ebook versions or audio book versions and library versions and more.

On that note, here's the books. There's 13 books in total I'm about to recommend, I encourage sampling whatever looks most interesting, and if it doesn't grab you, engage you, or retain your interest, freely put a book down and go somewhere else. 

### Books directly about trauma and sense of self

- pete walker, [complex ptsd: from surviving to thriving](https://www.amazon.com/Complex-PTSD-Surviving-RECOVERING-CHILDHOOD/dp/1492871842)
- pete walker, [the tao of fully feeling: harvesting forgiveness from blame](https://www.amazon.com/Tao-Fully-Feeling-Harvesting-Forgiveness-ebook/dp/B017I3NRRO?ref_=ast_author_dp) (don't be put off by the use of the word forgiveness, you don't have to forgive anyone)
- john bradshaw [healing the shame that binds you](https://www.amazon.com/Healing-Shame-that-Binds-You-ebook/dp/B016P6GC9A/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3DT44LSD5SVSD&keywords=healing+the+shame+that+binds+you&qid=1698413851&s=digital-text&sprefix=healing+the+shame%2Cdigital-text%2C373&sr=1-1)
- [Parenting from the Inside Out: How a Deeper Self-Understanding Can Help You Raise Children Who Thrive](https://www.amazon.com/Parenting-Inside-Out-Self-Understanding-Anniversary-ebook/dp/B00HZ1E5BM/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1W733XLM0RA2Z&keywords=parenting+from+the+inside+out&qid=1698413876&s=digital-text&sprefix=parenting+from+the+%2Cdigital-text%2C344&sr=1-1)
- [the adult children of emotionally immature parents](https://www.amazon.com/Adult-Children-Emotionally-Immature-Parents-ebook/dp/B00TZE87S4?ref_=ast_author_dp) (and the other 4 books by Lindsay C. Gibson, as it feels right.) This book is so short it could be read in a single sitting, almost, but it's _dense_, so I wouldn't recommend it. 

### parsing yours/others religious abuse/shame, and the vast overlap with the conditions fostering colonialism

This is all in the context of 'modern america'. I am a 35 year old white-passing male. 

I was raised in a a high-control religious cult. Similar to: [Under Pressure: What is it like to be child in a Religious Authoritarian home?](https://strongwilled.substack.com/p/chapter-2-under-pressure)

It's a form of emotional or mental colonialism, supplanting the will/social attitude that _was_ there (or would otherwise be there) with something preferred by the authorities.

The tooling for installing the 'package' was physical assault, abandonment, or later shame and threats, along with subtle presence and absence of warmth-approximating attitudes. 

Figuring out how to repair the damage isn't trivial. To that end, here's some books, about Evangelicalism, whiteness, colonialism, and _the willingness to coerce_.

It's worth remembering that early american police forces were nothing but deputized [slave patrols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_patrol). Evangelicals usually perceive the police as friendly to them, which means (üò¨) that evangelicals support slave patrol, and 'patrol energy'. It's very perceivable in home environments in ways that land as shocking to those who had alternative experiences.

When the white, slave-holding population is so vastly outnumbered by their slaves, it takes some creativity and sustained effort to prevent uprisings and rebellions.

The role of a slave patrol in a slaving society was to harass the majority population, find the most 'willful' slaves, and humiliate and degrade them (without killing them, of course. their labor had value) so that they would serve as a reminder to the other slaves, with their broken bodies and souls, of the cost of resistance. 

A dog maiming the legs of an 'uppity' slave, or a load of birdshot fired across the arms of a slave that wasn't sufficiently deferential, would leave scars, and a limp, and a maimed countenance, and any _other_ slave that saw the scars would know what had happened, and what might happen again.

In some counties in the slave-holding american south, 15% was white, 85% was black. The white people were _terrified_ of the threat of the slaves accruing power to themselves and taking action to improve their situation.

The attitudes these white people had towards their slaves morphed and changed over time, but still persist today, and are partially forced into the minds of all children, especially with religious dogma and shame. 

For example, a common statement/belief by some european settler colonialists was: 

> God placed the white man over the black man _for the benefit of the black man_

this belief, plus the belief in the concept of authority, led to white people getting mad at black people when the black people _didn't act thankful_ for the white man's domination. 

Please see, again, Samuel Cartwright's stunning contribution to the psychological sciences with [Drapetomania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drapetomania)

Of course, supremacy thinking wasn't just "white over black", it was also "men over women", "parents over children", "fathers over the entire family", and more. It's chivalry and nobility culture mixed with Anselm's 'satisfaction atonement' justification of violence, mixed into a dominance hierarchy... soup.

Lots of the modern world of hierarchical, authoritative structures are nothing but insane people doing incredible leaps of logic to convince themselves and their victims that the oppression in a given society was good, inevitable, ordained by God and logic. 

These kinds of people are dangerous to the children that they raise, the people that they 'help'. 

That means, though, that when you want to undo some of the damage they did to your soul, it's best to 'go to the source' and see what kinds of things white people said about their own domination when they were not embarrassed or ashamed by it, but actively colluded with other white people to further their domination over their victims. 

#### the books that might aid in deconstructing religious/cultural shame

To that end, consider reading any the following, if they look interesting to you:

1. The Origins of Proslavery Christianity: White and Black Evangelicals in Colonial and Antebellum Virginia](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2507760.The_Origins_of_Proslavery_Christianity?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=RxApdAuNZo&rank=1)
1. The History of White People](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6919721-the-history-of-white-people)
1. They Were Her Property: White Women as Slave Owners in the American South](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40887375-they-were-her-property?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=hpCcgRkOGN&rank=1)

There's also lots of propaganda around the 'privilege' of being part of a state (as long as you've achieved sufficient status within that state). If you sometimes find status games de-dignifying, read:

1. Against the Grain: A Deep History of the Earliest States](https://www.amazon.com/Against-Grain-History-Earliest-States/dp/0300182910)
1. seeing like a state: how certain schemes to improve the human condition have failed](https://www.amazon.com/Seeing-Like-State-James-C-Scott-audiobook/dp/B07D2HZXB4/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2FHVDG0449OQY&keywords=seeing+like+a+state&qid=1698414800&s=books&sprefix=seeing+like+a+sta%2Cstripbooks%2C369&sr=1-1)

Aver reading some of, or all of, these books, you'll be able to more naturally engage in de-shaming thought patterns, and might be able to find a bit more peace inside your own mind, a sense of solace from the 'toxic inner critic', or 'colonizer's voice' that our parents often force into our heads at a tender age.

## Emotionality and gender issues 


I'm not sure how to introduce these books. In my opinion, it's easy to say they're essential reading if you find yourself to be a women (or female-passing, or feminine, or not sporting a penis) in the modern world. Read the list, you might see why I say this:

- [Emotional Labor: The Invisible Work Shaping Our Lives and How to Claim Our Power](https://www.amazon.com/Emotional-Labor-Invisible-Shaping-Lives-ebook/dp/B09XL76CVF/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1698414876&sr=1-1)
- [Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men](https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Women-Data-World-Designed-ebook/dp/B07N1N6VKT/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1INU1SSL2WTSO&keywords=invisible+women&qid=1698414937&s=digital-text&sprefix=invisible+w%2Cdigital-text%2C607&sr=1-1)
- [Women Don't Ask: Negotiation and the Gender Divide](https://www.amazon.com/Women-Dont-Ask-Negotiation-Gender-ebook/dp/B08CR5GGZL/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3NDIVA561FH2R&keywords=women+don%27t+ask&qid=1698414974&s=digital-text&sprefix=women+don%27t+a%2Cdigital-text%2C369&sr=1-1)

But it sounds _insane_ to say "women might want to read these books, but men, you know, just... keep on scrolling". 

Presumably, if you're a man/have a penis, and reading this page, you are sensitive enough to appreciate that society is worse off to the degree that it conforms to hierarchical norms organized around a willingness to use physical violence. 

If you have women in your life, that you care about, these books might put you in a position to better care for those women, _and_ you'll learn things about yourself. I promise. Reading these books will directly benefit your relationship with everyone in your life, though like all of the books on this list, you'll find your blood boiling a bit as you read.

----------------------------

_uggg even using english dictates a certain frame on gender issues. I dislike anything that feels like [frame control](https://knowingless.com/2021/11/27/frame-control/)._

_a lot of 'modern stuff' feels distinctly american, and what happens when settler colonialism + nobility/purity culture gets 'buried' or hidden in something like intellectualism, over-intellectualism, self justification._

_Something that is undoubtedly true is 'supremacy/oppressor cultures are entirely devoid, necessarily, of the capacity to recognize and hold space for grief visible in the world around them, else they would necessarily self-correct_'[^her_property]

[^her_property]: I maintain [They Were Her Property: White Women as Slave Owners in the American South](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40887375-they-were-her-property) is indispensible for understanding broad swaths of American culture, and western culture. (slavery was rooted in the enlightenment, and of course systems of slavery shaped the world around themselves, then to now)

_or, supremacy culture is institutionalized emotional trauma, cptsd + an embodied belief in the legitimacy of authority/political authority_

Not sure how to introduce this post, other than... it's worth a read: [Three Hundred Ways It Can Hurt to Be a Man ‚Äî Introduction](https://elodes.substack.com/p/three-hundred-ways-it-can-hurt-to). I agree with the author on _a lot_

The way power dynamic exploitation gets encoded in certain male-ish 'norms' in culture is brutal. Self-sabotaging, all the way down. I only recently found a book written in 2006 titled: [Self-Made Man: One Woman's Year Disguised as a Man](https://www.amazon.com/Self-Made-Man-Womans-Year-Disguised/dp/0143038702). It was an instant download-and-read. 

Also, to overly-focus on _adult_ issues is a bummer. Children are an oppressed class. I thought it was self-evident to everyone, based on them having been a child, but I see now that this isn't the case - lots of adults internalize the bad things they experienced, normalize it, and push it down on the children around them. I overhear it in adult/child interactions all the time, especially now that I have a young child. 

I find the [taking children seriously](https://twitter.com/TCSparents) twitter account (and [website](https://takingchildrenseriously.com/)) to be a good resource for appreciating children as a class, seeing/witnessing them better.

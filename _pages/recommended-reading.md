I've read many books over the years. Thousands. 

Here's the ones that I cannot un-read, which shape me today. This list has evolved a lot since prior recommended reading lists.

## The built urban form in America

### The Slaughter of Cities: Urban Renewal as Ethnic Cleansing

This is the most important book on this list, I would say, in terms of how directly it can affect the world. 

Regimes of "urban renewal" completely re-shaped the face of cities across the country in the 50s and 60s, and for the same reasons that NYC has an outsized cultural weight around the world, and trends that bubble up there might sometimes materialize in cities and countries seven timezones away, the stuff the USA was doing in it's urban areas in the 50's and 60's became the same kind of stuff that happened in other countries.

"that stuff" the US was doing was putting the lipstick of 'intellectual justification' on the pig of 'ethnic cleansing'. 

In the exact same way that Hitler enacted regimes of ethnic cleansing against jewish populations (and, more broadly, any non-aryan, 'deemed unfit' populations), groups of people in the US worked strenuously to 'solve' their '{ethnic group} problems'. 

This was nothing but abhorrent evil. I cannot believe how often in 2023 I find myself saying versions of "ethnic cleansing is bad", and it passes over people's faces like incomprehensible word-babble. 

Maybe the problem is me, not them. Anyway, the big 'conceptual compression' is American road networks (and politically associated domains) have been used as pretty much the primary tool of ethnic cleansing in America. 

The people who use those road networks have been drafted into that conflict, unwillingly and unwittingly. 

Every time a Karen says "But what about my parking?" she is channeling the same intellectual starting and finishing point as Hitler was channeling when he said "But what shall we do about the jewish problem?"

> Jeeze, Josh, that seems strong. After thinking about it for a few seconds, I think you might be overstating your case...

Read the book.

### Order Without Design: How Markets Shape Cities

https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39644188-order-without-design

Cities run our world. Even if *you* don't live in one, you're affected by it. There's better and worse ways that cities can be managed and run. 

A healthy city is a giant social problem-solver.

An unhealthy city is a giant social problem-creator.

American cities started as the former. They're now the latter. 

This book is an academic tome but the world's most interesting man.

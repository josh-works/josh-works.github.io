I've read many books over the years. Thousands. Here's a few that I find myself referencing/recommending often. Periodically, I refresh this list. It's changed over the years years.

_the list you are about to read is heavily reworked, based off this older list: [josh.works/recommended-reading-original-list]({{ site.baseurl  }}{% link _posts/2018-05-17-recommended_reading_original_list.md %})_

These are the books I cannot un-read, which shape me today. Many of the books are "difficult". I often tell people I'm a slut for books - I'll read any book, for any reason, and if I "like" it is almost a complete afterthought. The real question is - can I glean something of value from it? Can I sift and find something, _anything_ that is helpful to me? That increases my understanding or imagination, or is an engaging-enough story?

If I can, I'm pleased with the experience. I can read English texts quickly, by the way. 

I don't sound out individual words, nor do I sound _any_ words out, in my head, as I read. I also experience my own inner world similar to the author of [this post about aphantasia](https://www.facebook.com/notes/2862324277332876/). I read for content and information without a single image passing through my imagination. I only recently learned that this is not the same experience everyone has. I can capture large fractions of lines of text 'at once' and process a page quite fast. Not everyone reads quickly, obviously. Literacy and hyper-literacy are... complicated. 

Anyway, plunge into a book only if reading seems pleasant-enough to make the effort worthwhile. No sweat either way, you'll get a sense of some things just by surfing book titles, I'm 'just' surfacing a list, one or two of which might catch your eye, and if it does and you click through to amazon or good reads or the library and find a review that seems ü§ìüßê and you have a nice few hours of reading, congrats to us both. üéâ

I also used a [Kindle Paperwhite](https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-16-GB-adjustable/dp/B09TMZKQR7) with a nice magnetic cover (easy to transport, read while waiting around, I carry it in my purse/hip bag/fanny pack), and am pretty good with my library card/Libby, and enjoy reading for sometimes purely dissociative purposes. 

This isn't a homework list, consider it to be a menu of potentially delicious entries, and IF any of them seem suitably energizing to you, choose them.


## 13 Books related to trauma, self-concept, and existing in the western world

I read the canon of any given topic that climbs high enough on my list of priorities to learn about. For a variety of reasons, dealing with the complexities of parents (having and being) and finding good terrain for partnerships and intimacy, are generally important to me, possibly you. 

I have also spent time, money, and energy on no small number of therapists. I evaluate about half of that time as neither helpful nor hurtful, but consumptive of opportunity cost, and 1/2 of the rest as actively detrimental and harmful, and the last 25% as marginally helpful.

So, instead of you spending thousands of dollars on therapy but not knowing which ones will help you, hurt you, or be wasted, I encourage you to do some bibliotherapy. I would want to talk about some of these books with therapists, and generally, they read few-to-none of the books I wanted to discuss, and would decline to 

You can get all/most of these books on [Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby) (a library app) and can send them for free to your [kindle paperwhite](https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-adjustable-Ad-Supported/dp/B08KTZ8249), anywhere in the world. 

Some of these books I've got physical copies of, some I bought electronic copies, because I've used a kindle paperwhite for many years, others I got the audio book version, some I got all three. Some of these I've gotten from the library, either a physical copy or a digital copy via Libby/overdrive. If your library doesn't have the book, google `[library system] request book form`. I've asked Jefferson County Library Systems to add at least ten books, and I think almost all were easily added. One didn't have an ebook option, and I didn't re-request for a physical version.

You could drop a few hundred dollars on books at the high end, or possibly spend not a single dollar on any of these. 

Read these books, be educated. In reading them, you'll find yourself naturally gravitating back towards (healthy) relationships with yourself and others. In the beginning, this process might involve looping in a therapist, but therapy can be expensive and uncertain, and, obviously, there are plenty of unskilled or unhelpful therapists. 

Also, therapy is a licensed and credentialed field in the USA, relies on the DSM, and [Draptomania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drapetomania) was once a thing, so... I won't go out of my way to dignify a profession that hasn't made peace with the skeletons in its own living room. If a therapist is helpful, AMAZING, and keep with that person, but I don't trust the average therapist farther than I can throw them. At least consider yourself responsible-enough and qualified to guide your own recovery. 

On that note, here's the books. There's 13 books in total I'm about to recommend, I encourage sampling whatever looks most interesting, and if it doesn't grab you, engage you, or retain your interest, freely put a book down and go somewhere else. 

### Books directly about trauma and sense of self

- pete walker, [complex ptsd: from surviving to thriving](https://www.amazon.com/Complex-PTSD-Surviving-RECOVERING-CHILDHOOD/dp/1492871842)
- pete walker, [the tao of fully feeling: harvesting forgiveness from blame](https://www.amazon.com/Tao-Fully-Feeling-Harvesting-Forgiveness-ebook/dp/B017I3NRRO?ref_=ast_author_dp) (don't be put off by the use of the word forgiveness, you don't have to forgive anyone)
- john bradshaw [healing the shame that binds you](https://www.amazon.com/Healing-Shame-that-Binds-You-ebook/dp/B016P6GC9A/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3DT44LSD5SVSD&keywords=healing+the+shame+that+binds+you&qid=1698413851&s=digital-text&sprefix=healing+the+shame%2Cdigital-text%2C373&sr=1-1)
- [Parenting from the Inside Out: How a Deeper Self-Understanding Can Help You Raise Children Who Thrive](https://www.amazon.com/Parenting-Inside-Out-Self-Understanding-Anniversary-ebook/dp/B00HZ1E5BM/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1W733XLM0RA2Z&keywords=parenting+from+the+inside+out&qid=1698413876&s=digital-text&sprefix=parenting+from+the+%2Cdigital-text%2C344&sr=1-1)
- [the adult children of emotionally immature parents](https://www.amazon.com/Adult-Children-Emotionally-Immature-Parents-ebook/dp/B00TZE87S4?ref_=ast_author_dp) (and the other 4 books by Lindsay C. Gibson, as it feels right.) This book is so short it could be read in a single sitting, almost, but it's _dense_, so I wouldn't recommend it. 

### parsing yours/others religious abuse/shame, and the vast overlap with the conditions fostering colonialism

This is all in the context of 'modern america'. I am a 35 year old white-passing male. 

I was raised in a a high-control religious cult, and was told, from a very young age, that everything about myself was foul, disgusting, unacceptable. 

It's a form of emotional or mental colonialism, supplanting the will/social attitude that _was_ there with something preferred by the authorities.

The tooling for installing the 'package' was physical assault, and then shame and threats, along with subtle presence and absence of warmth-approximating attitudes. Figuring out how to repair the damage isn't trivial. To that end, here's some books, about Evangelicalism, whiteness, colonialsm, and _the willingness to coerce_.

It's worth remembering that early american police forces were nothing but deputized [slave patrols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_patrol). Evangelicals usually perceive the police as friendly to them, which means (üò¨) that evangelicals support slave patrols. 

When the white, slave-holding population is so vastly outnumbered by their slaves, it takes some creativity and sustained effort to prevent uprisings and rebellions.

The role of a slave patrol in a slaving society was to harass the majority population, find the most 'willful' slaves, and humiliate and degrade them (without killing them, of course. their labor had value) so that they would serve as a reminder to the other slaves, with their broken bodies and souls, of the cost of resistance. 

A dog maiming the legs of an 'uppity' slave, or a load of birdshot fired across the arms of a slave that wasn't sufficiently deferential would leave scars, and any _other_ slave that saw the scars would know what had happened.

In some counties in the slave-holding south, 15% was white, 85% was black. The white people were _terrified_ of the threat of the slaves accruing power to themselves and taking action to improve their situation.

The attitudes these white people had towards their slaves morphed and changed over time, but still persist today, and are partially forced into the minds of all children, especially with religious dogma and shame. 

For example, a common statement/belief by white people was: "God placed the white man over the black man _for the benefit of the black man_", and this led to white people getting mad at black people when the black people _didn't act thankful_ for the white man's domination. 

Please see, again, Samuel Cartwright's stunning contribution to the psychological sciences with [Drapetomania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drapetomania)

Of course, supremacy thinking wasn't just "white over black", it was also "men over women", "parents over children", "fathers over the entire family", and more. 

Lots of the modern world of hierarchical, authoritative structures are nothing but insane white people doing incredible leaps of logic to convince themselves and their victims that the oppression in a given society was good, inevitable, ordained by God and logic. 

These kinds of people are dangerous to the children that they raise, the people that they 'help'. 

That means, though, that when you want to undo some of the damage they did to your soul, it's best to 'go to the source' and see what kinds of things white people said about their own domination when they were not embarrassed or ashamed by it, but actively colluded with other white people to furtheir their domination over their victims. 

#### the books that might aid in deconstructing religious/cultural shame

To that end, consider reading any the following, if they look interesting to you:

- [The Origins of Proslavery Christianity: White and Black Evangelicals in Colonial and Antebellum Virginia](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2507760.The_Origins_of_Proslavery_Christianity?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=RxApdAuNZo&rank=1)
- [The History of White People](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6919721-the-history-of-white-people)
- [They Were Her Property: White Women as Slave Owners in the American South](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40887375-they-were-her-property?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=hpCcgRkOGN&rank=1)

There's also lots of propaganda around the 'privilege' of being part of a state (as long as you've achieved sufficient status within that state). If you sometimes find status games de-dignifying, read:

- [Against the Grain: A Deep History of the Earliest States](https://www.amazon.com/Against-Grain-History-Earliest-States/dp/0300182910)
- [seeing like a state: how certain schemes to improve the human condition have failed](https://www.amazon.com/Seeing-Like-State-James-C-Scott-audiobook/dp/B07D2HZXB4/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2FHVDG0449OQY&keywords=seeing+like+a+state&qid=1698414800&s=books&sprefix=seeing+like+a+sta%2Cstripbooks%2C369&sr=1-1)

Aver reading some of, or all of, these books, you'll be able to more naturally engage in de-shaming thought patterns, and might be able to find a bit more peace inside your own mind, a sense of solace from the 'toxic inner critic', or 'colonizer's voice' that our parents often force into our heads at a tender age.

## Emotionality and gender issues 

I'm not sure how to introduce these books. In my opinion, it's easy to say they're essential reading if you find yourself to be a women (or female-passing, or feminine, or not sporting a penis) in the modern world. Read the list, you might see why I say this:

- [Emotional Labor: The Invisible Work Shaping Our Lives and How to Claim Our Power](https://www.amazon.com/Emotional-Labor-Invisible-Shaping-Lives-ebook/dp/B09XL76CVF/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1698414876&sr=1-1)
- [Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men](https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Women-Data-World-Designed-ebook/dp/B07N1N6VKT/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1INU1SSL2WTSO&keywords=invisible+women&qid=1698414937&s=digital-text&sprefix=invisible+w%2Cdigital-text%2C607&sr=1-1)
- [Women Don't Ask: Negotiation and the Gender Divide](https://www.amazon.com/Women-Dont-Ask-Negotiation-Gender-ebook/dp/B08CR5GGZL/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3NDIVA561FH2R&keywords=women+don%27t+ask&qid=1698414974&s=digital-text&sprefix=women+don%27t+a%2Cdigital-text%2C369&sr=1-1)

But it sounds _insane_ to say "women might want to read these books, but men, you know, just... keep on scrolling". 

Presumably, if you're a man/have a penis, and reading this page, you are sensitive enough to appreciate that society is worse off to the degree that it conforms to hierarchical norms organized around a willingness to use physical violence. 

If you have women in your life, that you care about, these books might put you in a position to better care for those women, _and_ you'll learn things about yourself. I promise. Reading these books will directly benefit your relationship with everyone in your life, though like all of the books on this list, you'll find your blood boiling a bit as you read.

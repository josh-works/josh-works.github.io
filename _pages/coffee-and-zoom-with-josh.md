# ‚òïÔ∏è & Zoom with Josh

Back before Covid happened, I would regularly grab a coffee or lunch with people I didn't know. 

I would regularly set up lunches at [Sherpa House](https://g.page/sherpahouse?share) in Golden, Colorado. Sometimes it would be just me and one or two other people, sometimes there would be 20 software-adjacent people chowing down. It was a great time.

I'm trying to bring some of that back. 

I'm still intentionally trying to hang out with people I don't yet know, so I'd be thrilled to "get a coffee" with you via Zoom[^byoc]! 

Schedule something convenient to you:

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Really? Total strangers? You're letting _total strangers_ schedule calls with you?

Yep. It's been great so far.

### Are you interested in just "software" people?

Not at all. In fact, if you don't consider yourself to be in a software-related industry, I'm particularly interested in talking with you. I spend most of my day around software people. I'd _love_ to talk to someone who isn't in software.

In fact, I've got a goal of helping people grow their salaries by an aggregate of $150,000 this year. 

I've got about $50,000 done, and need to help people get $100,000 in raises by July 2021. 

I do this by taking lessons from:

- [Don't Call Yourself A Programmer, And Other Career Advice](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/)
- [Salary Negotiation: Make More Money, Be More Valued](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/)
- [Fearless Salary Negotiation](https://fearlesssalarynegotiation.com/)

And helping people apply those principles to their own lives. 

Oh, and the companies that pay the increased amount? They're over the moon as well.

_Everyone walks away congratulating themselves on the great deal they got_. Lets chat.

### What do you talk about with total strangers? 

All sorts of things. The problem is not:

`what do you talk about`

The _actual_ problem is:

`it's completely impossible to close all the conversational threads that we open up in 30 minutes.`

We live in an interesting world. [Reality has a surprising amount of detail](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail).

### On the software side of things, this talk has generated a lot of conversation

I gave a 35 minute talk at Boulder Ruby titled `Combining 'The Business" and Improving the Performance of a Rails App'`. 

It's about how software developers at an individual level can bring about good things for themselves _and_ the business that employes them. 

It weaves some principles, stories, tutorials, and quite a few jokes. 

_update: whoa! The group laughs 8 times in the first 2.5 minutes! I just counted. This talk might actually be worth watching. You're statistically likely to enjoy it._

I'd love to chat about anything loosely related to what's covered in that talk.

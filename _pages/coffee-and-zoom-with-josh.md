# ‚òïÔ∏è* & Zoom with Josh

Back before Covid happened, I would regularly grab a coffee or lunch with people I didn't know. 

Now that Covid happened, it's been a while since a huge group of software developers sat down for that amazing Nepalese buffet at [Sherpa House](https://g.page/sherpahouse?share) in Golden, Colorado.

I'm trying to bring some of that back. 

I'm intentionally trying to hang out with <strike>strangers</strike> people I don't yet know, so I'd be thrilled for you to roll the dice on this!

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Really? Total strangers? You're letting _total strangers_ schedule calls with you?

Yep. It's been great so far.

### What do you talk about with total strangers? 

All sorts of things. The problem is not:

`what do you talk about`

The _actual_ problem is:

`it's completely impossible to close all the conversational threads that we open up in 30 minutes.`

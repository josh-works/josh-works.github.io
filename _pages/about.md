I've found that I've lost the ability to answer that standard question (explicit or implicit) you get when you meet new people:

> Tell me about yourself.

I have interests, like:
- [climbing](https://josh.works/tags#climbing)
- [programming](https://josh.works/tags#programming)
- [urbanism](https://josh.works/tags#urbanism)
- [streets and mobility networks](https://josh.works/about-roundabouts)
- the vast and fascinating overlap between urban renewal in America and ethnic cleansing
- the intersection of mobility networks and ethics

None of these are of utmost importance to me, but they're part of how I see the world, and I'm working on weaving this all together into a coherent narrative. I'm not there yet.

I value kindness, compassion, and a disposition of helpfulness.

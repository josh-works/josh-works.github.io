Overall, I pursue ease, joy, and meaningfulness. Sometimes I obtain them, sometimes not. 

I have at times identifed as an epistemic trespasser. Here's how some of my professional/personal interests translate into something legible to others:

- I sometimes function as a [researcher/advocate](https://zoningverydifferentthanours.substack.com/) on the issues of "the origins of some arcane bits of modern legal infrastructure."
- documenting (via Tiktok) [various aspects of the mobility networks I encounter](https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7262222886407179566), [conducting harm reduction where possible](https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7249752983481732394), as an example of how some aspects of our mobility networks could change, and why.
- improving the portions of a built environment that is allocated to vehicle movement and storage üöóüöõüõªüèçÔ∏è [you can hire me to do this for you](https://josh.works/get-more-from-your-parking-lots)
- [improving the performance of rails applications](https://www.intermediateruby.com/let-josh-audit-and-improve-your-test-suite). Productized consulting around (initially) just making one's Ruby/Rails test suite run 20-80% faster, locally and/or on one's CI provider of choice. 
- [climbing](https://josh.works/tags#climbing) üßó‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Bouldering on the 2016 moonboard, and when I put a harness on, I "have thoughts" around embodying a very real sense of "I longer feel fear while sport climbing, and experience profound peacefulness". I've called it coaching, I've been paid for it. Most of those I've worked with have seen 3+ grades of improvement across just a few scattered roped sessions.
- [programming](https://josh.works/tags#programming)
- ["programming" p2: this interactive map of a few years of scooter travel](https://mobility-data.herokuapp.com/).
- streets and mobility networks üöã. I want them to be good-enough, I'd like to consult on this topic, for pretty much anyone who has responsibility for a property line. 
- I've 'travelled a lot', read a lot, met many people over the years, been shaped by it, personally and professionally.
- I like to travel around on my 170cc gasoline scooter. All around Denver, of course, but you should know that [I recently rode from Denver to British Columbia, then to Seattle, and then back to Denver](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipN8q_LjvazfURfQUjnI21GQz23_PqlznCQ2fYC6OYCy15AIypU47XTi5S_mPdtaMw?key=N29iaXpDYXI5X2pFVjBUTGpQQmE5TmZTSnYyci1R). I sometimes "talk about scooters a lot/too much". ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- I've got a two year old daughter. As one could imagine, being a parent and partner is a thought-provoking and evokative experience. Ask me about it in person, sometime, if you've any inclination. I generally enjoy the topic. 

## Where else I exist on the internet

- [@josh_exists](https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists) tiktok - lots about scooters, and time-lapsed drone footage, and mobility conversations, niche hot takes
- [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27372191-josh-thompson)
- [strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/38072598) (follow me on strava for the most up-to-date info about travel, trips, mobility networks, and more). I use and mis-use the platform and infrastructure in service of that [mobility network data visualization app I mentioned before](https://mobility-data.herokuapp.com/). üò¨

## calling out some writing

- I've written useful guides to help people do difficult things. My guides have helped dozens-to-hundreds of people better learn software development, mostly via the Turing school, but they're all public and free for anyone. If you happen to be considering backend software development, [here's something that could be germane to you](https://josh.works/turing-backend-prep-01-intro).
- I have a project titled [Intermediate Ruby](https://www.intermediateruby.com/) that does just that. I also do [benchmarking/improving Minitest/Rspec test suites](https://www.intermediateruby.com/let-josh-audit-and-improve-your-test-suite).
- I have helped some people make huge gains in their climbing abilities, mostly by improving the technical and mental skills around lead belaying and lead climbing. It's a slippery slope from "getting really good at belaying" to "trying hard at 5.12 and 5.13". I [wrote a book](), and a [small book worth of blog posts](https://josh.works/tags#climbing). I've coached formally and informally dozens of climbers/climbing partners through this space (not even for them, for me. I cannot climb well unless I feel a certain degree of confidence in my belayer). Inevitably, all come away climbing several grades harder.


## This is nothing but a slice of who I am

It would be offensive if I acted like I could know you based on two minutes of conversation. This page you read is nothing but a few words I've cobbled together about myself, which is a mix of 'whatever is on my mind' and 'what I choose to share and talk about'. 

The topics discussed above are just facets of how I interact with the world,and I'm working on weaving this all together into a coherent narrative. I'm not there yet.

I value, and desire to embody:
- kindness, compassion, and a disposition of mutuality and mutual aid. 
- Strong boundaries. Self reflection. Child-like joyfulness and playfulness. Peacableness. A refusal to endorse or employ violence as a problem-solving strategy.
- A willingness to work extremely hard, when the situation warrents.

Visit [https://josh.works/blog]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/blog.md %}) for more. There was a time in my life that I wrote on this website a LOT. That's where you'll get it. I've been just as engaged in the world as I've ever been, but in the last two years I have written publically dramatically less than I did in the prior 8 years.

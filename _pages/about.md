## Hi, I'm Josh

I write, a lot. 

I try _really hard_ to make it worth reading what I write, which means I want to "deliver value", which has a few different potential definitions. 

I write words for people (like what you're reading right now) and I write words for computers. Learn more about the latter at [Intermediate Ruby](https://intermediateruby.com/). 

Incidentally, as much as I seem to spend a lot of my day behind a computer, _I'd much rather spend almost zero time behind a computer_. I love to ride my bike around my hometown of Golden, Colorado.

I've worked for software companies since 2012, across divisions like customer support, inbound sales, customer success, product management, and, since 2017 Ruby/Rails software development.

### Things I've said

I've been on one podcast, and given one talk at a meetup.

## Services

When I do paid work, it's often for something related to software. Sometimes it's been _selling_ software, sometimes it's been _developing_ software, and sometimes it's been to _teach things about software_.

I also do work unrelated to software development, like [bike tours of Golden]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/golden-bike-tour/golden-bike-tour.md %})!

It's possible we've swapped emails, phone calls, or IRL[^irl] conversations about a problem you face. You might lead a team of software developers, or you've founded your company in the last few years, and you're intrigued by some potential that could come from us working together.

Stick a time on my calendar, and we'll chat via Zoom or, if you live in Golden, and it's warm enough to be outside, I'd gladly meet up in person: [josh.works/coffee]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/coffee-and-zoom-with-josh.md %})

I have an open standing invite to meet up with anyone, for any conversation. It could be via Zoom or it could be in-person in Golden

Don't believe me? Go ahead, test if I'm serious: [josh.works/coffee]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/coffee-and-zoom-with-josh.md %})

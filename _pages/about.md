I pursue ease, joy, and meaningfulness. Sometimes successfully.

I have been called by my biggest supporters and detractors various flavors of an epistemic trespasser. Here's how some of my professional/personal interests translate into something legible to others. They're not sorted in any particular order, despite using an `<ol>`

1. I write on Substack about that distinctively American regime of land use norms. Currently enumerating the fact that american laws around land use and mobility networks were created by eugenicists _explicitely_ to accomplish ethnic cleansing [https://zoningverydifferentthanours.substack.com/](https://zoningverydifferentthanours.substack.com/). 
1. I document on Tiktok [various aspects of the mobility networks I encounter](https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7262222886407179566), [conducting harm reduction where possible](https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7249752983481732394). There's drone videos, 360 degree camera footage, of places in America, Canada, Asia, and more. 
1. [improving the performance of rails applications](https://www.intermediateruby.com/let-josh-audit-and-improve-your-test-suite). Productized consulting around (initially) just making one's Ruby/Rails test suite run 20-80% faster, locally and/or on one's CI provider of choice. 
1. [helping less-experienced engineers become more-experienced and confident engineers](https://intermediateruby.com). I've got some stuff happening at [intermediateruby.com](https://intermediateruby.com)
1. streets and mobility networks ðŸš‹. I want them/us/it to 'do better'. If you have responsibility for a property line, I'd like to talk to you.
1. I've 'travelled a lot', read a lot, met many people over the years, been shaped by it, personally and professionally.
1. My primary vehicle is a 170cc gasoline-powered motorscooter. All around Denver, of course, and America, and the world. If you'd had some of the same experiences I did, on a scooter, you might agree with me that scooters are incredibly efficient, under-appreciated vehicles. Their cargo capacity is 10x what you can do on a motorcycle, their emissions is probably less than 1/10th of a four-wheeled vehicle (tailpipe emissions, noise pollution, brake dust, tire rubber microplastics) and they consume less than a 10th of the space of a traditional four-wheeled vehicle, both when parked and in movement. Their lightness (300 lbs) and tiny dimensions also allows a number of infrastructure innovations that unlocks ingeneous use of space in other ways. 


As you could guess, this represents an ebb and flow of energy and focus, across several years.

I couldn't agree more.

This page is very under construction.

I am a problem solver and capacity builder.

I have a keen sense of smell for power dynamics, and I'm extremely sensitive to persons with power using that power to oppress others.

When people pay me, at some point they're usually paying me for "software development", but the reason they paid me anything is only partially related to code. I spend most of my time doing research and building understanding, and _then_ I'll drop into "tactical implementation" mode, and make a PR.

That said, I don't believe in the `git push, git paid` approach to software development. 

Sure, I make technical contributions to codebases, but no one pays money for code, they pay money to get problems solved.

So, I solve problems. But only sometimes do I get paid, or even consider charging money for it. 

I _love_ to have fun while I work. I love to have fun when I'm not working, too.

I have an open standing invite to meet up with anyone, for any conversation. It could be via Zoom (like chatting with Siddharth from Chennai! ðŸ‘‹ Siddharth!) or it could be in-person in Golden, or anything in between. Go ahead - test if I'm serious: [josh.works/coffee](https://josh.works/coffee)

Some of you are less interested in coffee - I've perhaps piqued your curiosity about solving pressing business problems, or you're contemplating a big work-related decision, and you think I might have something to offer. If you're interested in exploring that more, head over to [josh.works/work-together](https://josh.works/work-together) 

On that page, you can choose to pay $250 for a conversation, $50 for a conversation, or $0 for a conversation. I'm equally pleased with any of these payment amounts.

I have an ongoing email series centering on these two photos:

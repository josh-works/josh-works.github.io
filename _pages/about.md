I've got many different interests, and projects, and this page is very much a work-in-progress.

First, I'm live in Golden, Colorado. Since I like to have friends and family nearby (who doesn't), I'm trying to get everyone I know to agree to try to move here, or at least to plan on visiting. 

Golden is _massively_ under-appreciated, and is a place full of potential, arguably more potential than nearly any other place in the USA[^bold-claim].

[^bold-claim]: you: "Bold claim there, Josh, can you actual-"; me interrupting: "yes, you might be new here keep reading."

## Software development

I've had an eclectic life, as I think is pretty common. I'm pretty good at solving some kinds of problems, with certain kinds of "software-enabled" solutions. My LinkedIn says "Software Developer", and probably something about Ruby and rails. I think Rails 7 is _amazing_, and am really excited to be whatever "fully invested in the Ruby/Rails ecosystem" is. 

I've got a bit of an obsession with knowledge transfer and learning and education and skills development and practical problem solving, generally as expressed within Ruby and Rails. 

I've not written much in the last two years on this website, but [here's some of my writing tagged `rails`](http://josh.works/tags#rails). 

I've also written about the Turing school and resources for being well-prepared for learning software development. [here's some of my writing tagged `turing`](http://josh.works/tags#turing)

Finally, I'm rounding up "educational skills-development stuff" at [intermediateruby.com](https://intermediateruby.com). 

I've given talks at meetups and conferences, and been on some podcasts. More on that below. 

## Climbing

Many of the most significant experiences of my life have happened because of the sport of rock climbing, or within the rock climbing community (and all the adjacent implied communities). 

I've had some lovely opportunities to climb all over the country and the world, with family and friends. 

I climbed at, worked at, and lived a lot of my life at what was for a time the largest climbing gym in the USA (Rockville, Maryland) in a formative time of my life, between late teens and early 20s. 

My approach to software development has always been informed by how I've approached rock climbing. I train hard, climb hard, and try hard. I've loved learning to move safely and confidently through "dynamic environments and situations", and the skills/experiences I've had through my years of climbing informs much of the rest of my work.

[I've written a tiny bit about climbing](http://josh.works/tags#climbing).

## Golden, CO

I really like Golden. I've lived in Golden for almost 10 years, and even ran for city council in 2017! [^running-for-council]

I ride my bike and scooter ALL over Golden and Denver. I give bike tours[^bike-tour]

[^bike-tour]: They're not very official, but after the 3rd friend said "you should offer these for money", I said "ok fine", and now you can pay me! [ðŸš² tour of Golden with Josh]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/golden-bike-tour/golden-bike-tour.md %} )

## Misc

If you've ever hung out with me in person, or spoken with me via Zoom, I've probably spoken in an emotive way about cities and recommended a book (or four). I spend a lot of brain cycles on mobility networks.

Cities, and the people who live in them, and interactions therein, are fascinating to me, in a fractal way.

I've spent time in many different cities (and not-cities) around the world. I've slept on roofs, on the floors of busses, in tents and trains, air mattresses, sleeping bags, blankets, mattresses, couches, beds, and everything else, and loved every minute of it. 

I've spent a lot of time moving from one place to another. My wife and I spent almost two years doing the digital nomad thing (before covid, back before it was _quite_ as common as now). 

These days, we're LARPing as a normal ex-DINK tech power couple. We recently traded two incomes and a cheap apartment for one income and a way-overly-expensive (and oooold) house. We finally made a beautiful baby girl, and a pretty bad injury I got in 2020 is clearing up. 

I have an email newsletter (a few, actually) that I have not yet figured out a good cadence for emailing/communicating with.

{% include newsletter.html %}

_Here's a teaser of the kinds of things we will discuss in the newsletter:_

Compare these two drawings about Charleston, SC:

![subsidized and ugly](/images_2020/subsidized.jpeg)

![illegal but beautiful](/images_2020/illegal.jpg)

Why might one of these be subsidized, and why might one be illegal? What are the first-order and second-order effects of such things?

Which would you like to be built across the street from you?

More critically, **what are the second-order effects of fixing what is broken about this subsidized/illegal dynamic?**

## Products, Guides, and Services

Most of what I make is free to use. I would strongly prefer most of what I do to be as helpful and widely available at somewhere between "free" and "you make money while or because of interacting with it." 

That said, we live in a cold, capitalist society. I can kick it with accountants and sales teams, and I do legit stuff worth real money:[^not-current]

[^not-current]: I must apologize, this list is not current nor comprehensive, but I hope to nudge it along towards both.

- I offer [coaching for software developers and "software people"](https://github.com/sponsors/josh-works). I know, sounds audacious. It really tends to bubble up in other ways, and ends with a "what if you did {such and such}, but with an attitude informed by this other thing we were just talking about..."
- A twitter rant turned into a small [rails test suite profiling](https://www.intermediateruby.com/let-josh-audit-and-improve-your-test-suite) productized consulting business. It wasn't the right time for me to spend adequate resources on, but was some of the most fun I've ever had. 
- After spending too many hours wrestling to learn basic webscraping in Ruby [for this joke of a project](https://random-hn-blog.herokuapp.com/) that I'd planned on taking me like one hour, I compressed most of my learnings into a _very_ accessible [Nokogiri obstacle course](https://github.com/josh-works/intermediate_ruby_obstacle_course/tree/master/nokogiri). It's free, but is currently the best value-units-per-hour learning resource I've ever created, at least for people belonging to a very specific group.
- [Pair along with an expert developer on your first open-source contribution](https://www.intermediateruby.com/make-oss-contributions-part-0-introduction)
- [A detailed walk-through of Turing's Futbol project](https://github.com/josh-works/futbol)
- [bike/brewery/urbanism tour of golden, co]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/golden-bike-tour/golden-bike-tour.md %})
- I gave testimony to the [Governmental Accounting Standards Board]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2021-03-29-gasb-notes.md %}), because why not? They're the group that set standards for Corporate GAAP and Municipal GAAP.[^if-you-know]
- Voted "Most likely to be psyched to go to an obscure conference"

[^if-you-know]: If you know, you know.

#### Footnotes

[^time-is-short]: "things" today move at a glacial pace compared to other times/contexts. I have always been very aware of the shortness and frailty of life, in a way that has lead me to feel a bit different from many around me. I blame various formative life experiences for this fact. But in 2022, I think it's safe to assume that many, many more people can understand my generalized sense of urgency.

[^running-for-council]: I had just finished Turing, and decided to see what the experience of local politics was like. I'll try nearly anything once. Here's what I explained to people, when they asked why I (a then-27-year-old) was getting involved with something like politics:

    > This is more interesting than sitting on my couch in my boxers all day playing Call of Duty.

    I was, as you may imagine, repeatedly chastised for my irreverence. (And late campaign finance reports. I spent more in late fees on my spending reports than I ever spent "campaigning")
    
    I only got like 11% of the vote, and since most of the "campaign season" is also "prime climbing time at the RRG", I wasn't even around for most of the actual campaigning.

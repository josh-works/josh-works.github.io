I am a problem solver and capacity builder.

I have a keen sense of smell for power dynamics, and I'm extremely sensitive to persons with power using that power to oppress others.

## What I do for work

When people pay me, at some point they're usually paying me for "software development", but the reason they paid me anything is only partially related to code. I spend most of my time doing research and building understanding, and _then_ I'll drop into "tactical implementation" mode. I never do tactical implementations without fully understanding the project at the strategic level. 


It's possible we've swapped emails or phone calls about a problem you face. You might lead a team of software developers, or you've founded your company in the last few years, and you're intrigued by some potential that could come from us working together. If that's the case, read more about this at [josh.works/work-together]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/work-together.md %}) and book a session to discuss the opportunity.



_A quick note on "business value": If you're reading this, thinking I'm talking only to people who run businesses, and not individuals or "bottom-of-the-organizational-chart employees", you are sorely mistaken. If you consider yourself to not have power or agency in your job, you might have an incorrect mental model of your work. This incorrect mental model will cost you tens of thousands of dollars over the course of the next few years of your life. Please give me a chance to change your mind: [josh.works/coffee]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/coffee-and-zoom-with-josh.md %})_

I've helped persons across industries win raises, or negotiate improved job offers (often getting improved offers well above the "max allowable rate" the company said they could offer), by helping the person understand the business value their employment delivers to their potential employer. I've done this with lawyers, doctors, public school teachers, customer support employees, software developers, first-time managers, and more.

I have an open standing invite to meet up with anyone, for any conversation. It could be via Zoom (like chatting with Siddharth from Chennai! ğŸ‘‹ Siddharth!) or it could be in-person in Golden, or anything in between. Don't believe me? Go ahead, test if I'm serious: [josh.works/coffee]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/coffee-and-zoom-with-josh.md %})

Oh, and I do free tours of Golden by bicyle. It's virtually guaranteed that you'll see Golden in a new way. I love biking around Golden, and I'd love to take you on a tour. High points include:

- Nerding out about infrastructure
- Seeing things I promise you've not seen before
- You'll never be able to un-see what you'll see on this bike tour. 

I'll gladly grab a coffee or a beer with you before, during, or after. (But probably not before, during, _and_ after. ğŸ˜‚)

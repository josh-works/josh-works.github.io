I pursue ease, joy, and meaningfulness. Sometimes successfully.

I have been called by both supporters _and_ detractors various flavors of "an epistemic trespasser", and I'm generally guilty as charged. 

Here's how some of my professional/personal interests translate into something legible to others. They're not sorted in any particular order, despite using an `<ol>`

1. I write on Substack about that distinctively American regime of interlocking land use norms + mobility network norms. Currently enumerating but a few of the many ways that american laws around land use and mobility networks were created by eugenicists _explicitely_ and _effectively_ to accomplish ethnic cleansing üëâ [https://zoningverydifferentthanours.substack.com/](https://zoningverydifferentthanours.substack.com/). 
1. I document on Tiktok [various aspects of the mobility networks I encounter](https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7262222886407179566), [conducting harm reduction where possible](https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7249752983481732394). There's [drone videos](https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7292699759607958815?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7303498805574878751), [360 degree camera + scooting footage](https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7302666678926888238?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7303498805574878751), and more, from places in America, Canada, Asia, and more. 
1. [improving the performance of Ruby/Rails web applications](https://www.intermediateruby.com/let-josh-audit-and-improve-your-test-suite). Productized consulting around simply making one's Ruby/Rails test suite run 20-80% faster, locally and/or on one's CI provider of choice. 
1. [helping a given software person become a more-experienced and confident software person](https://intermediateruby.com). I've got some stuff happening at [intermediateruby.com](https://intermediateruby.com)
1. I've 'travelled a lot', and in some mildly distinctive, unusual ways. I've read a lot, met many people over the years, been shaped by it, personally and professionally, and there's plenty in the cognitive hopper, as a result.
1. As of a few years ago, my primary vehicle became a 170cc gasoline-powered motorscooter, and it's ruined me in the best way possible. I ride it [all around Denver](https://joshs-mobility-data-54dab943ebba.herokuapp.com/?zoom=15&latlng=18.785133,%2098.982139#), of course, but also [america](https://joshs-mobility-data-54dab943ebba.herokuapp.com/?zoom=5&latlng=45.120053,%20-113.115234), and ride scooters most places I go. [Here's data for a 24-hour layover/scoot-around Taipei, for example](https://joshs-mobility-data-54dab943ebba.herokuapp.com/?zoom=12&latlng=-8.557596,%20115.227356). If you've had some of the same experiences I've had, on a scooter, you might agree with me that scooters are incredibly efficient, rather under-appreciated vehicles. Their cargo capacity can be stunning, they are twice as gas-efficient as a motorcycle, let alone a four-wheeled vehicle. Because they're so surprisingly agile and small, a variety of interesting path-finding options emerge for the user. If you 'care about the environment', you might be interested in considering that their emissions is at least less than 1/20th of a four-wheeled vehicle (tailpipe emissions, noise pollution, brake dust, tire rubber microplastics) and they consume less than a 10th of the space of a traditional four-wheeled vehicle, both when parked and in use. Their lightness (300 lbs) and tiny dimensions/low-center-of-gravity also allows a number of infrastructure innovations that unlocks ingeneous use of space in other ways. I contend they're also quite easy/fast/comfortable/restful to use, compared to both bikes/e-bikes, _and_ cars. tl;dr, consider test-riding a scooter, taking a motorcycle riders training course (optional but wise) and inching in that direction. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


As you could guess, this list represents a smattering of the ebb and flow of energy and focus, across several years.

I spent a few hours recently helping my 75-year-old mother-in-law reconnect her junky old Windows laptop to the internet. Across five phone calls, and many pictures of her computer screen, we got her internet working again. 

As I did this, I live-tweeted the experience:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My mother in law is frustrated that her internet wasn&#39;t working today. It&#39;s been broken all day. I&#39;ve called her a few times between other events to try to help debug it. <br><br>This is a screenshot I just received (via email) that she took *with her phone* <a href="https://t.co/5KnfCGZ2F4">pic.twitter.com/5KnfCGZ2F4</a></p>&mdash; Josh Thompson (@josh_works) <a href="https://twitter.com/josh_works/status/1290420667444338688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

Later that day, here's what happened:

So, I've got a lot of the questions I'll need answered jotted down, and I wanna see if there's any interest in buying a guide like this. Would it be worth $10 to you? $100? $1000? 

In the pole, someone expressed it might be worth as much as $2000, so I am including that option below.

Maybe it's worth $1000 but you don't even have $5 to spend to acquire the guide. Whatever I end up creating, I'll make available to you. 

Here's the spec sheet of the guide, as it exists in my head right now:

# The Why/What/How Much

I decided that, for the both of us, we needed to get her a Chromebook. I'm convincing her, and I'm going to write a detailed guide, everything from:

## What/why

I'll answer questions like:
- When I recognized it was the right time to actually take action
- How I phrased the pain-points so she would agree that it was a problem
- How I used the time I spent debugging her problems convincing her that she should use a different type of laptop
- what actual machine to buy
- how to set up an account for your parent
- how to handle them using a non-gmail account (I assume this is a requirement)
- how to take remote access of the machine and accomplish tasks yourself. (This beats your mother-in-law emailing you cell phone pictures.)
- her reactions and first-run experience with my documented process
- how I tweak my plans based on her responses
- how to use all of this information to aid your own parents through a similar process

# The benefits you will receive from this guide
- Help your parent(s) feel a sense of dignity and control through this process, even though it might feel like it's displacing an important, familiar thing needlessly
- Remove a point of frustration that might be emotionally charged, thanks to issues related to maintaining competence and control over one's affairs. (I suspect I'll be looking for a `step-by-step guide to helping your aging parents stop driving` soon)
- how to help your parent(s) use as much Gmail as they have to, while most likely using their primary email address with an `AOL` or `yahoo` or `comcast` email account. (and they get tons of spam in it)
- How to handle a password manager with them. Use or don't use Chrome/Firefox password tools?
- Oh, 1Password? If you use 1Password, and have your parent's credentials in a 1Password vault that is shared with your siblings and/or in-laws, but you're the one who manages that account, what should you do? 
- the above presumes that you came to have your parent's credentials _at their request_, how should you handle that?
- once it's set up, can it be easy enough to set up that they can unbox it themselves?
- how much does it cost to ship a laptop through the mail, anyway? Is it safe? Legal?
- Is it _actually_ possible to "easily" "remote in" and "fix things" for your parents? The reader might be skeptical of how "easy and simple" software often is, and is curious to know exactly what to expect.
- An example to point to, when convincing your parent to take the plunge. 

> Look, this guide is from this guy on the internet that did _this exact same thing with his mother-in-law who was similar to you because {reasons}_, and look at this quote here where she says how thankful is she did this thing:

>> Hi, I'm Barb, and since I switched to this chromebook thing I spend 20 extra minuts a day facetiming with my grandkids! I love that!

# Do not purchase the guide if:

- If your parents are familiar with the Apple ecosystem, because I have always used Android and MacOS, don't have an iPad or an iPhone. I feel strongly inclined to do MacOS.
- If you don't want to use a Chromebook or learn a Windows operating system

----------------------

The poll got some answers, so I'm tossing up real-live purchase buttons to guage interest at your level of buy-in

## Featured Articles

A few months ago, a friend reached out with an _extremely_ specific problem. He was trying to Postman to send params to an endpoint he was working on, and was getting inexplicable stack traces from a third-party library. 

It just so happened that I'd run into nearly the exact problem in the `griddler` and `griddler-mailgun` gems, and documented the debugging process:

- [Exploring source code via Griddler and Griddler-Mailgun]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-06-08-exploring_griddler_and_griddler_mailgun_source_code.md %})

If you're a software developer working in Ruby, trying to send/receive email from your application, the above post might be _desperately_ useful. Otherwise, probably not so much.

Here's a grab-bag of the posts I'm most proud of. I don't value them for how many pageviews they get or how useful they are to _most_ people, I evaluate them by how much value they deliver to a very narrowly-defined group of people. This list is entirely arbitrary, and changes occasionally.

These are projects and courses I've made. 

Some of them have options to buy things, some don't. Some are educational for others, some are educational just for me. The thread is that these are _finished products_ and can be discussed/evaluated as such.

I try to be biased towards finishing projects. To that end, here's a list of projects and products I've built.

This page is inspired by Tom Critchlow's [The Importance of Launching](https://tomcritchlow.com/2017/01/26/f-yeah-side-projects/)

These are ordered by recency, magnitude, or interestingness to myself.

### Power Broker Quotes

**Get One Quote from _The Power Broker_ in your inbox, every week**

As I work on email sending infrastructure professionally, I wanted a little playground to replicate some of the message sending infrastructure used at Homebot, like `rails`, `redis`, `sidekiq`, `twilio/sendgrid`. 

One of my favorite books is _The Power Broker_ by Robert Caro. (I've written extensively about this book [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/robert-moses.md %}))

Anyway, the project is rapidly evolving, but there's a code-a-long available in the `readme`, from `rails new` to here.

### How to Integrate Stripe and a Static Site

Have you ever wanted to add a very basic payment integration for something you're selling on your static website?

I sure have, and I found it particularly challenging, especially with multiple products/tiers (I.E. selling a $29 and $49 thing).

So, I figured it out, and you can sample the course, or buy it, here:

### A Runbook for Upgrading Your Parent's Junky Old Laptop to a Chromebook

I spent many, many hours doing research on how to upgrade my mother-in-law's laptop from an old nearly-unusable Windows PC to a Chromebook.

> Why'd you want her on a Chromebook, Josh?

Because my wife and I are her primary tech support team, and she lives two time-zones away, and she often is frustrated by her computer, from printing things, to downloading attachments, and navigating the internet enough to follow along in the lives of her kids and grandkids.

A Chromebook has a _very_ easy-to-use "remote in" feature, so when she has a problem, she knows to click a button in the favorites bar, read me the code, and now I can see her screen _and_ control her computer. It's so easy to show her how to do things with this set of tools.

I'd lost many, many hours to trying to help her with poorer tools before.

### Intermediate Ruby Obstacle Course

This repo contains a collection of "obstacle courses" that are laser-focused on quickly leveling up very discrete skills.

Currently, the only _finished_ obstacle course is [Web Scraping with Nokogiri Obstacle Course](https://github.com/josh-works/intermediate_ruby_obstacle_course/tree/main/nokogiri)

The information contained within the obstacle course is the "meat and potatoes" of how I built the next item:

### Sidekiq and Background Jobs for Beginners

I cross-posted [this article to Medium](https://josh-works.medium.com/sidekiq-and-background-jobs-for-beginners-89c95fef786f) a while ago, and it gets a surprising amount of SEO-driven traffic. I'd like to expand this article into a short course at some point.

### An 8-part Guide to Preparing for Turing's Backend Program

Dozens of Turing students have said that this guide has been the reason they've been successful at Turing. That means, conservatively, this guide has delivered tens of thousands of dollars of value. A slightly more expansive definition of value (inclusive of opportunity cost and time) means this guide has delivered _hundreds of thousands of dollars of value_. 

I'm proud of it. It's exactly what I wish I'd had before I attended Turing.

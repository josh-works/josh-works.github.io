## Move Slow and Improve Things: Performance Improvement in a Rails App

_[Denver.rb Monthly Meetup @WeWork](https://www.meetup.com/Denver-rb/events/rqjnpqyzdbqb/), Feb 12, 2018_


We talked about performance profiling!

[Here's the slides, on Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j7v300oh52x0jb5/denver_rb.key?dl=0)

I'll post the talk video shortly. 

I'm working on going deeper on the topic of Rails performance. I've got a lot more on the topic brewing. If you wanna stay in the loop, drop your email below. (I can't promise that _everything_ you'll get from me will be Rails performance posts, though...)

I've worked in the B2B SaaS space for almost 10 years now, from front-line customer support rep to inbound API sales, to enterprise account management, to software developer. The constant thread throughout this journey was "I made meaningful contributions in a variety of domains."

### Interim/Fractional Team Lead

I always 'led from behind', and the teams I was on _were better for my involvement_. 

I can take a team of 4-6 people and, if given a little room to work, I can double their satisfaction with their work and double the average employee tenure, by putting _people_ ahead of any other goal.

> Wait, Josh, you're saying if I hire you to help a team you're going to put them ahead of me, and my company, which is hiring you????

Yes, precisely. I put them ahead of you because _they_ put themselves ahead of _you_, and because _you_ put yourself ahead of _them_. This is just how people work, and if you can go "with the grain" of humans, you'll have a much better time. 

If you have an "orphaned" team, or you're looking to help a team grow their capacity[^grow-capacity], I can help. I smoothly move between "counselor and therapist" and "technical expert" in a way that allows less-experienced developers to _rapidly_ grow their capabilities and confidence.

[^grow-capacity]: However you define capacity and other measures of effectiveness and health.

## How to work together

Building a trusted working relationship starts with getting to know each other. Feel free to grab time to chat informally on my Calendly link: [calendly.com/joshthompson/coffee-with-josh](https://calendly.com/joshthompson/coffee-with-josh)

From there, we'd move to a small, short roadmapping session where you (and other stakeholders) would chat directly around the problem. These often springboard into larger ongoing retainers and embedded team leadership opportunities.

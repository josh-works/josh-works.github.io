This is step 2 of this treasure hunt! You made it!

If you got this far, shoot me a text, let me know you completed the second challenge! Please use "pumpernickle" somewhere in the message.

My phone number is 340-483-2951, but add `1` to the last digit, and subtract it from the first digit.

That javascript was indeed loaded from a cloudfront domain. Now you know a little about how the internet works - you inspected the HTML of this website, either by right-clicking and finding the "inspect HTML" option, or by `curl`ing the page to your terminal, and reading the bottom two lines.

(That was how I came up with this challenge. I just wanted to see what someone could `curl` and find an answer to.)


Can't wait for that text. More to come.

Challenge 3: not yet determined.

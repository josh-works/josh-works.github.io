<p><em>I'm giving this talk the same way I present information in a "professional" setting:</em></p>
<ol>
<li><em>I give as much information before the meeting as possible. (Can the meeting be avoided with more information sharing? If yes, share more information)</em></li>
<li><em>I give everyone time to review the notes I have prepared.</em></li>
<li><em>Summarize, summarize, summarize.</em></li>
<li><em>Lead with the important bits. </em></li>
</ol>
<p><em>I work at <a target="_blank" href="https://litmus.com/meet-the-team">Litmus, Inc</a>. It's a Boston-based software company that is a <a target="_blank" href="https://litmus.com/blog/were-a-2014-best-places-to-work-winner">really cool place to work</a>. We're growing ~50%/year (did $15.4mm in business last year. Growing quickly. I was employee 31, we're about to pass employee #50. Competent employees/staff, good pay, 6 weeks paid vacation, good equipment, and most importantly, we're a remote-friendly company. (that's the biggest benefit to me).</em></p>
<p><em>I want to share information that may help some of you end up in really satisfying jobs in a few years. I shamelessly promote the benefits of software and the internet. You can work in "progressive" work environments and do things that impact tens of thousands of people. There are certainly other good jobs out there, but many have more red tape or barriers to entry.</em></p>

<h1 class="text-align-center">Your Second Job is the First One that Matters</h1>
<p><strong>tl</strong><strong>;</strong><strong>dr</strong><strong> (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl%3Bdr">definition</a>): Don't stress about the next few years, or your first "real" job. <em>It doesn't matter that much. </em>Only two things really matter:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What you do with the opportunity you have</strong></li>
<li><strong>What you do outside of work</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>By the time you are looking for your second job, you can collect much evidence that you're skilled, competent, enjoyable to work with, and effective at what you do. You also might start having a small clue about <em>what you want to do.</em></p>

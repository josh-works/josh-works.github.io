<p>Constraints are USUALLY seen in a negative light.</p>
<p>Google defines it as:</p>
<blockquote>a limitation or restriction</blockquote>
<p>Here's some example constraints that we find in the world around us, which we often view as an annoyance or frustration:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have to be to work by 9a</li>
<li>I have to get up at 7a</li>
<li>I have $50 to spend on entertainment this month</li>
<li>This paper must be at least 8 pages long</li>
<li>I have only 30 minutes of time to myself every day between work and family and sleep</li>
<li>And many, many more. Some trivial, some not.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, no one pops out of bed in the morning thrilled that they have a limited amount of money to spend on something.</p>
<p>Constraints relate to prioritization, which means you don't actually <em>have</em> to follow them, you just have to care if the item producing the constraint matters to you.</p>
<p>Easy example: I don't follow many rules of writing, or anything really, when writing on my own website, because... I can do whatever I want. I have goals and ideals with my writing, but they're more like aspirations than constraints.</p>
<p>I can stick in unrelated images and comics wherever I want, if I so choose.</p>

<h2>Embrace as many constraints as you can</h2>
<p>So what about embracing constraints?</p>
<p>I decided to pick the first two words that popped out of a random word generator, and see if I could make something useful from it.</p>
<p>I think I'm off to a strong start:</p>

<p>On to Wikipedia, to find something useful. </p>
<p>Searching "rodent actor" didn't turn up anything good.</p>
<p>The "Rodent" wikipedia page came up blank when I ctrl+F'd for "movie".</p>
<p>So, I turned back to Google, and found this gem: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/list/ls000471351/">Top 10 films featuring rats</a></p>
<p>Interestingly, the #2 listing is Ratatouille, which I both watched and ate in the last few weeks. It's delicious, and an enjoyable movie. Turns out <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0652663/?ref_=tt_cl_t1">Patton Oswalt</a> is the voice behind Remy, the movie's protagonist rat.</p>

      <a href="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/pixar/images/a/a9/Ratatouille-remy3.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/235?cb=20150214191242"><img src="/squarespace_images/static_556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729_56035dbbe4b07ebf58d79d16_574022f6d51cd44d18680e91_1463821048085_Ratatouille-remy3.jpg_" alt=""></a>


<p><a href="http://pixar.wikia.com/wiki/File:Ratatouille-remy3.jpg"><em>Pixar.wikia.com</em></a></p>
<p>He was also in <em>Blade:Trinity</em> and <em>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</em>.</p>
<p>And boom. There's something to write about off of two random words.</p>
<p>PS Why is embracing constraints on my mind? I'm trying to get better at doing just a few things, not all the things.</p>

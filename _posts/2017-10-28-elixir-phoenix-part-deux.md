I planned on working through [this](https://medium.com/@benhansen/lets-build-a-slack-clone-with-elixir-phoenix-and-react-part-1-project-setup-3252ae780a1) tutorial for building a slack clone, but half-way through the set-up instructions, after I installed Elixir and Phoenix, I [took a long detour](_posts/2017-10-27-intro_elixir.md) through the basic set-up guide. Built some custom routes, along with controllers/views/templates, etc.

I'm now a bit more comfortable with the basics of the framework and language, so I'll now be working through the tutorial, and [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Rubber_duck_debugging) by writing about it as I go.

_This will be a bit of a work-in-progress. Onward._

## Introduction 

I've long wanted to have a definitive place where I can explain why I keep thinking of/referencing this thing I call, others call, 'frame control'. 

It's tricky. When it's being experienced unpleasently, it often-enough mimics tactics of verbal abuse and emotional neglect. 

Some people unintentionally 'use' frame control to try to achieve a certain outcome on a certain topic. It's 'just' slightly coercive conversation, at it's lightest, maybe.

Others, the true masters of frame control, use frame control to deftly verbally box and bully the victim into some intellectual position, constraining them emotionally as directly as leg shackles constrain someone's physical movement. 

More I can say, for now, I suggest reading the canonical piece:

👉 [https://knowingless.com/2021/11/27/frame-control/](https://knowingless.com/2021/11/27/frame-control/)

It's worth reading in it's entirety. My childhood experience of a father figure was similar to the same for the author. I long ago stopped interacting with him, and a few times recently happened to use words to communicate with him, and could 'clock' the tactics so directly and easily this time.

The conversations were short and unproductive, which is fine, _I didn't get hurt_, which I cannot say for the 5, 8, 12 yeard old versions of me who spent hours, days, years in the presence of someone like this. 

The 'not frame control' response to this would be a conversational style informed by something like:


- frame "choosing and using", instead of frame controlling
- frame 'following'
- frame 'checking' 
- conversational mutuality

i keep noticing when I talk with evangelicals about 'their' things, I can make a concession and 'put on' their frame, which is something that they act entitled to. I can then express everything I want to express from the POV of their frame, but since it's non-conforming, I then get shunned. 

But never-not-once have they expressed a willingness to try out, or even recognize, that there might be a different 'frame' on the same issue, and globally useful/good/agreeable actions will probably pass mustard in all frames.

Sometimes one issue is seen as 'complex' inside of one frame, but might seem different in useful ways seen through a different frame.

To me, once I learned to dual wield 'the concept of frame control _at all_' and 'there are many possible/useful frames, and i dislike not using this to our collective advantage'

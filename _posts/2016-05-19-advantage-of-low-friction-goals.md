If you have a project, make it easy to take small steps.




I'm trying to publish something every day for a month.




Normally, I would sit down at my computer, open a text editor, write
something, the copy it into Squarespace, and customize the post from there.




"Customization" means:
- create a reasonable URL
- create a post excerpt
- instruct squarespace to post a link to Twitter and Facebook
- hit publish




Instead, today, I wrote this on my phone, in an email to a "email to post"
email address.




It's low friction, and I'll fix the url later.




Easy things are more likely to get done than hard things.

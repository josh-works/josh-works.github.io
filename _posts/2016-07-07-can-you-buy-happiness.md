 You can't, but that won't stop you and me from trying, at least a little.



We (Humans, americans, at least "other people like me") like to buy 
things. But we should do more than just buy 
things.


>Experiences can have a much bigger impact on people’s happiness than things, and a big part of that happiness lies in looking forward to the experience that you are going to have.



This article is long,
[but it is worth a read.](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/114031/money-happiness-and-new-science-smarter-spending#)



If you have $100 to spend on something, schedule something you will look forward to for a week or a month. Looking forward to something 
is as important as enjoying the thing itself. 



If you want to have 4x the fun, invite someone along.

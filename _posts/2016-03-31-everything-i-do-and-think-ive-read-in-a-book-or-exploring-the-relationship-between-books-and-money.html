<p>Here's yet another big post on money and income and saving and reading.Â I tried to write everything on my mind in one massive letter, so I could write a really detailed answer once, rather than a less-useful but less-thoughtful email that I can never reuse.</p>
<hr>
<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>I'm enjoying our slowly-evolving conversation-by-text. Since we're many time zones apart, and I like to think and digest between texts, it's been a slow conversation.</p>
<p>We've "uncorked" two topics so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Am I living on 50% of my income, per my stated goal last year?</li>
<li>"I read really slow" which I repackaged as "what's the 'break-even point' on reading to justify prioritizing it above other items in my life.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 50% of my income thing is a whole long thought on it's own, but I'll take a quick stab.</p>
<h2>Am I (Josh) living on 50% of my income?</h2>
<p>No. For two reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>I</em> don't have <em>my</em> income. <em>We</em> have <em>our</em> income.</li>
<li>It's hard to track that exact percentage, so I don't know <em>what</em> percentage we're living on. I think it's about 65% of our income.</li>
</ul>
<h3>"My income" doesn't exist </h3>
<p>Kristi and I have 100% combined finances<em>, so it's </em>our* money. Not my money. For a few months last year Kristi was not working, and at no point did the thought pass through my head that she was not pulling her weight.</p>
<p>*For our sanity, we both have "fun money" budgets of about $100/month. We can spend it however we want, but it's to remove any guilt or justification around small purchases. I want to buy {frivolous thing}? Great. I've got fun money. Kristi wants to withdraw five $20 bills and light them on fire? No problem. It's her fun money.</p>
<p>It started as $50/month, and we've bumped it up a bit over the last two years.</p>
<p>The tool I use to track all of this is called "<a href="http://www.youneedabudget.com/learn">You Need A Budget</a>", and is worth every penny.</p>
<h3>I don't know the exact percentage that we're living on </h3>
<p>I've got 30% of my paycheck going to retirement funds, and have a 4% match from my employer, so before a paycheck lands in our checking account, 34% of that money has gone to savings. I earn about 2/3s of our household income, so that accounts for the first 17% household savings rate.</p>
<p>Beyond that, we've been putting money aside in our checking account, with the plan of investing it. The reason we have a lump sum of money sitting there is because of <em>friction</em>. I've not set up an automatic investment strategy yet with Vanguard, and it's a pain in the butt to do, so I've just not done that. This is bad, and writing these words makes me want to fix that.</p>
<p>What I do know, doing back of the envelope calculations, once you throw in all income/expenses and close one eye and squint the other, I think we're saving ~30% of our income every month. Maybe more</p>
<p>I still want to get to 50% saved, at least a few months this year.</p>
<blockquote>Cool, so you save a lot of money. What's that have to do with reading?</blockquote>
<h2>The relationship between money and reading</h2>
<p>Just about everything I think in the world I've gained from a book. <em>I don't have original ideas.</em> At best I might combine an idea about one thing with a new topic, and poof, it seems new. (To me, a coworker, a friend, et.) But it's really not new. It's the same old idea applied to a new thing.</p>
<p>Books are where you get the ideas to apply to new things.</p>
<p>The two big things that have helped us save a lot of money is "earn more" and "spend less".</p>
<p><em>I just spent a long time googling around for a good list of reasons to prioritize reading, and couldn't find any lists that I really liked.</em></p>
<p>I do not like the lists because the lists were all about reading books. I don't read books because I like to read, though I do enjoy it.<em> I read books because it's a small investment in my life. Reading is the quickest, most effective way to grow my knowledge, and who I am as a person.</em></p>
<p>Every book, fiction or non-fiction, is a tiny little addition to who I am as a person. Over time, those additions add up. Some books contribute more than others.</p>
<p>Reading feels like a delightful obligation I have to myself, my family, and those around me. Every bit of knowledge I glean or idea I have from a book can benefit me and Kristi, directly.</p>
<p>Here's a list of topics I've read about in the last year or so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marriage</li>
<li>Relationships (with my wife, with God, with others)</li>
<li>Finances</li>
<li>Physical fitness</li>
<li>Happiness</li>
<li>Solitude</li>
<li>Mental fortitude/independence/self-control</li>
<li>Lots and lots of fiction. (I love sic-fi and fantasy, but read plenty of other fiction too)</li>
<li>Economics</li>
<li>Habit building/morning routines</li>
<li>Thankfulness</li>
<li>Money (again)</li>
<li>Autobiographies of accomplished people (the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FBFMHU/ref=x_gr_w_bb?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=x_gr_w_bb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000FBFMHU&amp;SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2">two</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316037702/ref=x_gr_w_bb?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=x_gr_w_bb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0316037702&amp;SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2">best</a> autobiographies I've read were written by felons-turned-consultants)</li>
<li>Relationship building (social skills, ways to add value, etc.)</li>
<li>How to build an audience</li>
<li>How to set healthy boundaries in your life</li>
<li>How to identify and pursue the "essentials"</li>
<li>How to roughhouse with kids</li>
<li>How to grow your career by doing better and better work</li>
<li>Happiness (again)</li>
<li>How to become an authority on a topic</li>
<li>How to charge more as a freelancer</li>
<li>How the food we eat impacts the world around us</li>
<li>More books about money</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>I said a moment ago that reading feels like a delightful obligation? Why did I say <em>obligation</em>? Easy. If you boiled the themes of the above list down to just the basics, you could say that these books cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>ways I relate to others</li>
<li>ways I relate to myself</li>
<li>Ways I can deliver the most value possible for anyone who hires me, and in return can ask for a larger and larger piece of compensation.</li>
<li>Ways I can manage my resources (time, money)</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these themes are so important that anyone alive today would be well-justified to study these topics to learn more about them. By reading, you do just that.</p>
<blockquote>I get it. Reading is cool. You've STILL not tied this back to making phat stacks of cash</blockquote>
<p>Lets imagine Joe makes $40,000/year. Lets imagine that Joe gets a raise tomorrow and doubles his annual income. Good for him! What does he do now?</p>
<p>If Joe is average, his lifestyle inflates. He was living on $40k, but in six months, he'll be living on that full $80k. If he loses his job and has to go back to $40k/year, he'll quickly rack up big debt, because he's used to spending more.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if Joe makes $40k, but lives as if he makes $35k, and gets a raise to $80k, <em>and does not increase his spending</em>, he can start putting away $45k a year in the bank. Whoa.</p>
<p>Now, there's three things going on with this story:</p>
<ol>
<li>Joe starts earning more money</li>
<li>Joe keeps his life style from in flaring</li>
<li>Joe saves the extra money</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these three topics is the subject of many books. Sometimes one book touches on all three, but usually not.</p>
<p>If "make more money", "don't spend it all", and "save the difference" is an appealing plan, the only option is to read. Online articles are not sufficient, though they are a great place to start.</p>
<blockquote>Blah blah blah, books books books. Fine, I'll read one. Can you make some recommendations?</blockquote>
<p>Sure. We'll start high level and go down from there:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Will-Teach-You-Be-Rich/dp/0761147489/ref=sr_1_1?">I Will Teach You To Be Rich</a> Super sketchy title, but at the end, you'll angrily say "How has no one told me this before?" before overhauling your financial life.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Slight-Edge-Turning-Disciplines-Happiness/dp/1626340463/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459404389&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+slight+edge">The Slight Edge</a> (about the long-term impact that trivial daily decisions can have. I.E. things that are <em>easy to do, but just as easy not to do</em>.) It's not specifically about money, but offers a very valuable framework for that kind of decision-making. Unfortunately, it does come across as self-helpy quite a bit, talking about how "readers of this book have changed their lives". I don't like that kind of stuff, but the content is quite good.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Your-Money-Life-Transforming-Relationship/dp/0143115766/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459404423&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=your+money+or+your+life">Your Money or Your Life</a> This book is sort of the bible of the "financial independence" crowd, and explains how it's possible to become financially independent without making millions. This gets into the "why" <em>and</em> the "how" of "make more money, avoid lifestyle inflation, save the rest."</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fearless-Salary-Negotiation-step---step/dp/0692568689/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459404460&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=fearless+salary+negotiation">Fearless Salary Negotiation</a> Self-explanatory title. This is the "how to make more money" step in a very practical way.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Next-Door-Surprising-Americas/dp/1589795474/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459404512&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+millionaire+next+door">The Millionaire Next Door</a> A encouraging reality check - most millionaires in America don't look like millionaires. They drive used vehicles, they live modest lifestyles. This is exactly <em>how</em> they have become millionaires, and nothing changes when they cross that seven-figure line. Of course, a million dollars in 1980 is worth $2.8MM today (<a href="http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">Bureau of Labor and Statistics</a>), but it's still a nice round number to aim for.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a starting point. I would argue that one could not read these five books and be unchanged by them. If you read ten minutes a day, you will finish, on average, one book a month. This is an excellent pace.</p>
<p>Pick the most interesting looking title, go order it from Amazon. (And, none of these are affiliate links. I don't do that, never will)</p>

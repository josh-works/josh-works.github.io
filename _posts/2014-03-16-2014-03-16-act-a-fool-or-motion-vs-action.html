<p>If you've started reading this article, but have only two minutes, don't read what I'm writing. Go read <a href="http://jamesclear.com/taking-action">this article</a> by James clear. It's called "<a href="http://jamesclear.com/taking-action">The Mistake Smart People Make: Being In Motion vs. Taking Action</a>". I've linked it a third time <a href="http://jamesclear.com/taking-action">here</a>. Go read it.
James starts with a simple definition:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Motion</strong> is when youâ€™re busy doing something, but that task will never produce an outcome by itself. <strong>Action</strong>, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will get you a result.</p></blockquote>
<p>Motion, as defined, obviously won't get you to your goals. It is, be definition, those things that you do that don't produce.</p>
<p>Action, as defined, gets you where you're going. The difference between the two is that you don't get criticized for motion. You can get a ton of criticism for action.</p>
<p>We humans are a cautious bunch - we're more likely to do small things that return small but predictable benefits. Those large things we may do can fail nine times out of ten, and that failure <em>can be</em> devastating.</p>
<p><strong>Applied</strong></p>
<p>We all speak to each other, and the quality of our speech matters. When I think "public speaking", I don't imagine giving a speech to hundreds, I imagine how I carry myself in front of groups of people I don't know well. Incidentally, this is most of the people I interact with.</p>
<p>I wanted to get better at public speaking. So, I read a few articles and watched a few videos. This was all <strong>motion</strong>. I quickly realized this, and thought "the one thing I really don't want to do is give a speech to strangers". So... using that fear as an arrow towards the path of greatest growth, I gave a speech.</p>

<p>I read about two paragraphs from "<a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2009/07/11/manvotional-self-made-men-by-frederick-douglass/">The Self-Made Man</a>", a speech by Frederick Douglass and, if you watch the video, you can see that absolutely no one even noticed me. This was an extremely short way to get a little closer to fearlessness in these situations.</p>
<p>Not only does this short exercise exemplify the difference between motion and action, but if you want to get more confident in public, this is a ridiculous but effective method.</p>
<p>I'm trying to keep my eye out for other equally effective short cuts to obtain real-world experience doing difficult/uncomfortable things. If you have ideas, send 'em my way. I won't commit to anything, but I'm open to just about everything.</p>

<p>I was looking through some draft posts I have lying around, and found one from the middle of 2013. That's 2.5 years ago. Reading over it, I feel satisfaction for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Old Josh (from July 2013) wasn't a train wreck. As soon as I think about myself in highschool and college, I usually cringe thinking about the way I acted/thought. I don't feel complete shame thinking about 2013 Josh.</li>
<li>The goals I had in 2013 have pretty much all happened. We didn't have much knowledge over our finances then, but we do now. (I discovered <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youneedabudget.com/learn/guide/learn-to-prioritize">YNAB</a>, which completely transformed our relationship with our money)</li>
<li>This affirms my suspicion that <em>lots of small steps taken over a long time can make good things happen</em>. </li>
</ol>
<p>I've been reading and thinking a lot about money over the last two years. I'll compile a recommended reading list here soon, but the cool thing is this: I <em>enjoy </em>managing our finances. I'm no longer embarrassed or shamed by them. </p>
<p>And if we got to that place in 2.5 years, I think most people can. Here's what I wrote then:</p>
<h2 class="text-align-center">Josh's thoughts on finances <em>circa</em> July 2013</h2>
<p>[<strong>2016 Josh notes</strong>: I’ve included commentary in-line with what I wrote then.  It is all called out like this.]</p>
<p>I write this July 27th, 2013, and I don't know when I will publish it. <strong>[2016 Josh notes</strong>: Perhaps in January, 2016]</p>
<p>Currently, I have no plans of publishing this within six months, but eventually I hope this post meets the internet. Money scares me. Having it is scary, but losing it is even worse. Kristi and I have been married for 13 months, and we have alternated between me being the sole income-earner (on less than $30,000 a year, in one of the most expensive cities in America) to us <em>both</em> working (she's a kindergarten teacher in PG county - not lucrative, but way more money than zero dollars) to <em>Kristi</em> being the sole income-earner (I got fired). [<strong>2016 Josh notes</strong>: I could write extensively about being fired, but right now I'll summarize it as <em>the best work-thing that has ever happened to me</em>. It was an opportunity for enormous growth.]</p>
<p>I was able to get unemployment (through the business, not the government) but it was still stressful. It was almost six months before I got another full-time job, earning about $34,000 a year.)</p>
<p>Then, we both were working, and it was great! I could know exactly how much was deposited in our bank account every two weeks. Our lifestyle inflated, and we found ourselves spending more. Or, rather, <em>I </em>found us spending more. I'm in charge of managing our finances, and sometimes it sucks. [<strong>2016 Josh notes</strong>: It sucked because I did not know how much we spent, and was not able to know if we were generally improving our financial position, treading water, or losing ground.]</p>
<p>During the summer, Kristi's not receiving a paycheck, so we're temporarily back down to one income. But we're used to spending like we had two incomes. A few large expenses have come through (a few plane tickets, an <em>awesome</em> family vacation with 15 extended family members, but it was a half-block from Rehoboth Beach, and cost what you would expect - a lot)</p>
<p>So, right now, I've dipped into our savings to cover our expenses. There's nothing wrong here - we knew she was not going to be earning money over the summer. [<strong>2016 Josh notes</strong>: Partial lie. We <em>thought </em>she was going to be paid over the summer, but turns out PGCO bobbled the paperwork. We "knew" this when her paychecks stopped in April.] </p>
<p>I still have this inexplicable sense of discomfort, because I don't know some pretty basic details of our own spending. I'm embarrassed even as I write this. Income in per month (easy to know) compared to spending per month - also fairly easy, but the afore-mentioned big-ticket items have drastically skewed our "average spending". [<strong>2016 Josh notes</strong>: We knew our expenses <em>retroactively</em>, I.E I could look at a credit card statement, but we never had <em>planned</em> our expenses, or managed our spending based on goals or expenses. Yikes.]</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to living on just one income, and saving half of our take-home. This is a huge milestone. The steps, as they look right now, are these:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify current income/expense ratio</li>
<li>Identify low-hanging fruit to reduce expenses</li>
<li>Reduce said expenses</li>
<li>Repeat step two, until we're unwilling to further reduce expenses</li>
<li>Boost income without inflating lifestyle, so all extra income can go into savings.</li>
</ol>
<p>And, well, that's my plan.</p>
<p>[<strong>2016 Josh notes:</strong> For the most part, we've done all this. A significant portion of our income goes into savings, and I know our income/expense ratio, and can PLAN our spending well in advance. We've boosted our income but reduced our lifestyle from 2013 levels, so more money goes into savings/investments.]</p>

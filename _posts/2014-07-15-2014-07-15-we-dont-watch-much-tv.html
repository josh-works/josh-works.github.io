<p>But when we do, we watch <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ninja_Warrior">American Ninja Warrior</a>.
It's great fun. The obstacles take a mix of strength and skill, and every one is pretty good-natured.</p>
<p>It seems that often some of the best contestants are also rock climbers. Many come into it from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour">Parkour</a> background, but they get fatigued and fall, or, have bad technique, get fatigued, and fall.</p>
<p>The courses look doable. I know some extremely strong climbers who have tried to get on the show. I'm not sure why they've not gotten on the show. It's a fun goal to think about. Maybe one of these upcoming days, I'll make it to the show. We shall see.</p>

<p>Here's a problem many of us first-worlders have: cold pizza.
There are two options. Microwave it, or throw it in the toaster oven or regular oven. A microwave makes it soggy, and a regular oven takes <em>forever</em> to heat it up.</p>
<p>(If you're willing to eat it cold, may god have mercy on your soul.)</p>
<p>Well, there's a solution to this problem. Here's how it works.</p>
<ol>
<li>Before you get your pizza out of the microwave, throw your skillet on the burner, medium heat.</li>
<li>Microwave your pizza for 45 seconds or so, until it's warm.
- This is the important part-</li>
<li>Place your pizza on the skillet</li>
<li>Cook it until it's crispy on the bottom</li>
</ol>
<p>This process is very quick. If you're lucky enough to have a gas range, it will add about two minutes to your 45 seconds of microwave time. If you're forced to work with a regular electric oven, it'll take a while to get the skillet hot. Sorry.</p>
<p>Guess what I had for dinner?</p>

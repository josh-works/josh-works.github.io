<p>Kristi and I are spending a few weeks in Fayetteville, WV, home of the New River Gorge. There's fantastic climbing here. I climbed with good friends, and was absolutely humbled by how strong they all are. (My defense, at least for the next few weeks, is that I've not climbed consistently for 4.5 months)</p>
<p>I've been climbing regularly this last week, trying to recondition my skin and muscles. I've got a long list of projects to work on (thanks Brian and Christian) so the next few weeks should be productive.</p>
<p>I got on a lot of hard climbs, and made it to the actual tops of few of them. Sent nothing. Lots of room for improvement.</p>

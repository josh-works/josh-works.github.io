<p>It seems most of the decisions in life are made in favor of the <em>present</em> you, or the <em>future</em> you. I wish the future me could sit beside the present me, and discuss how I was going about my day. Instead, it's a rather one-sided conversation.
There are obvious choices, like food, spending money vs. saving, going to bed early - these are all clear calls, and would be even more clear if the future me was here to advocate on his behalf.</p>
<p>There are subtle choices, too. Things like how to engage in relationships with others, how to invest in myself and others. These would benefit the most from a pocket-sized future me.</p>
<p>If anyone invents this, I'll buy.</p>

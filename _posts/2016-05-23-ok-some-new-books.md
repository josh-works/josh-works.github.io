Yesterday, I proclaimed "
[No new books]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2016-05-22-no-new-books.md %})". I spent a lot of time today thinking about that proclamation.



Do I really want to limit myself to just the books that I've already picked for myself?



Yes. Maybe.



There's a kind of book I don't want to read any more of. That's the "get started with a project" kind of book, or the general productivity stuff that's floating around.

So, I'm trying to reduce the consumption of tactical knowledge when it's not helpful, or when I cannot act on it. I want to dwell on substantial, helpful literature, and maybe even find a few books I'd like to read twice.



I don't read TONS of fiction, so I don't see that as a habit I should try to give up.



So, in short, I'm trying to reduce books that are:


* written recently


* non-fiction


* business related

[summarized](http://www.nateliason.com/infomania/) better than I can:


>[Don't read it...] if it doesn’t answer a specific question you’re currently asking, cover philosophical knowledge, or entertain you, then don’t read it.


>Words to live by.



PS This was prompted by my friend Alex making a sci-fi book recommendation. His recommendations are always excellent, so I felt like my priorities had to be wrong if I banned myself from following up on his suggestions.

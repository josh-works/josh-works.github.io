Most of us have goals. And we usually don't reach any of them.
The 
[Minimum Viable Product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) "concept" has helped me with some goals, and it could be helpful to you.



It's a simple concept: When starting something new, figure out what the minimum investment would get you the required return.



Here's how it played out for me in the last few weeks:



I've wanted to write a book about lead climbing, and how to deal with fear. It was so daunting of a project, I put off any progress for a long time, and then once I 
did start making progress, I easily sidetracked myself down a thousand different rabbit trails.



The only time I have made progress was when focusing on the 
minimum required investment, and what next step would get me there.



I am far from done, but it's gotten me this far.

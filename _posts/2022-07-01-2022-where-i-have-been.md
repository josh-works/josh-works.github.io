I've been some version of "away" or "gone" for a long time. It's been a harrowing journey, in many ways.

There's many folks (many, at least, to me) that I also owe some explanation/apology tuple.

I've been injured, sick, and have felt broken for a long time. I think I've found myself in a verbally abusive relationship, and those dynamics have fueled each other.

I am absolutely not going to stay in a verbally abusive relationship, don't worry.

This is simply some of the explanation of what's happened, how it's affected my communication, especially with loved ones.

I hope to make some corrective actions going forward, and there might even be a few things that you can do to help me, to the degree you feel at all inclined. (And _i_ will be fine either way! I place no obligations on you, and if I did, you should reject them on principle anyway)

When I think back over the last few years, what sticks out to me are mistakes I've made and ways things have gone wrong.

When I look back through the last two years of my calendar, I think on how it's not _just_ been bad things. There's been lots of good, too, so I kinda want to speak to all of it.

## Eden

Oh my gosh. Eden. She's incredible. I delight in her, and love watching how she engages with the world around her. I look forward to many years of friendship with her.

I could spam this with pictures, because she's the cutest baby lots of people (not just me) have seen, but I'm not big into photos around here.

Labor, delivery, and the first few weeks of her life were quite intense, lots of people rallied to support us.

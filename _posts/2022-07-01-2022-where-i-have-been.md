I've been some version of "away" or "gone" for a long time. It's been a harrowing journey, in many ways.

There's many folks (many, at least, to me) that I also owe some explanation/apology tuple.

I've been injured, sick, and have felt broken for a long time. I think I've found myself in a verbally abusive relationship, and those dynamics have fueled each other.

I am absolutely not going to stay in a verbally abusive relationship, don't worry.

This is simply some of the explanation of what's happened, how it's affected my communication, especially with loved ones.

I hope to make some corrective actions going forward, and there might even be a few things that you can do to help me, to the degree you feel at all inclined. (And _i_ will be fine either way! I place no obligations on you, and if I did, you should reject them on principle anyway)

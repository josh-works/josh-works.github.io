I've got nieces and nephews who, either currently or over the next few years, will be transiting an interesting stage of life. Maybe going from age 14-ish to 17 or 18-ish. That's sorta the age range I'm thinking of.

But I'm also thinking specifically of some people who were raised in 'church groups' or who's parents would clock as 'evangelical'. 

I'm thinking of _myself_ when I was 14-18 years old. 

I'm writing to the children of decendents of european americans who participate in anything that could be called 'evangelicalism' in 2024.

This is tricky to get out, I'm not quite sure all the needles I'm trying to thread here. 

## Unfortunately for you, you live in the Age of Authority

Some folks call this the 'industrial' age, or the 'modern' age, or the 'information' age.

I've been thinking it's better called the Authority age. It's shocking, how heavily some parts of the world you and I live in (like America) is OBSESSED with authority. 

Your parents likely believe in authority more than anything else in their lives. They think _other_ people "have authority" over them, and thus it's right for them to "have authority" over you. You, of course, don't get authority over anything. (Did you know some people consider children to be the most oppressed class?)

(I just finished reading "Spare the Child" by Philip Greven, it's a horrible description of the world many of my peers and their parents grew up in. Over and over again in the book is made clear these people's obsession with "authority".)

It's impossible to grow into a healthy person inside of a confining container, and the authority obsession your parents have will have crushed a portion of your soul, your sense of self, your confidence in your own perceptions and experiences. 

You won't live in the house of your parents always, and once you establish financial independence, you can hold your parents at arms length, and their structures of authority, if you want.

## Scrabbling for a little emotional and mental safety

A defining feature of growing up around the kinds of people who move like this is that it's _dangerous_. It's dangerous to exist around someone who thinks hurting you skillfully enough will get what that person wants. It's dangerous to be that kind of person. 

Evangelicalism is harmful because it's full of people who believe in the skillful application of pain to get what they want. This has been long done by many people groups, and to see it clearly is to also solve it, I think. To see it clearly is certainly to be less affected by it, and to maintain agency where it might otherwise be lost. 

Evangelicalism is not the only institution full of this energy, but it's one I still have memories of experiences with, and I like to leave a trail of intellectual breadcrumbs, as I noticed concepts clicking in my brain. [^reframes]

[^reframes]: I have made a few reframes around evangelicalism that cause the world to make more sense to me. It's clicked as I've made other reframes around the overall concept of authority. For instance, evangelicalism is very concerned with the proper application of something like "authority", that became less interesting to me once I noticed I did not actually believe in the concept _of_ authority. [The Problem of Political Authority]() wasn't what I necessarily expected to cause me to waltz out of evangelicalism, but it ended up being the most decisive read. 

I'd encourage you to find these books at libraries. You can ask your library to add books to the library system, or use an 'interlibrary loan system', or torrent/pirate some of these books, or find some books or summaries for these books online. 

You'll have to undo some programming that your parents (and a church system, if you existed along side that institution) have instilled in you. It's very possible that the concepts of these books will be _plainly obvious_ to you, because you've been regularly victimized by the people who believe in these things. 

- [The Most Dangerous Superstition](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10836816-the-most-dangerous-superstition) 

The "Superstition" in question is the concept of "authority". Every time my parents hit me, they said it wasn't _them_ hitting me, it was _god_ hitting me, because HE had authority over them, and told them to hit me.

- [The Problem of Political Authority: An Examination of the Right to Coerce and the Duty to Obey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15794037-the-problem-of-political-authority?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=DrpkRVYchM&rank=1)

Emphasis on 'right to coerce' (entitlement) and the 'duty to obey' (obligation). To summarize, political authority is as valid as the religious authority that dominated europe in the 16th, 17th centuries. "political" authority is still "just" a narrative of who has an entitlement of control, and who else has an obligation of obedience. 

- [The Verbally Abusive Relationship](https://www.amazon.com/Verbally-Abusive-Relationship-Expanded-Third-ebook/dp/B004GUS7OG/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1700109538&sr=8-1) A lot of y'all/us were raised by verbally abusive people. Signs of that would be "low desire to ever initiate contact with ones parents" and other indicators.  

Tons of KIDS YOUNGER THAN YOU are being put on anti-depressants, because their caretakers deem them to be 'too sad'. My own parents never would have put me on anti-depressents, but they were devestatingly unable to see that I hated how they treated me, and so when I displayed withdrawal, or muted responses, or anger, they reflexively emotionally slapped me for not 'having a good attitude'. 

My dad certainly is text-book verbally abusive, as a way of being. I don't know how I would have been different if I'd read this book in highschool, but I wish I had. A sure indicator of an abusive person is "how do they respond to you trying to make yourself safe from them". If I ever defended myself from my dad (like interrupting his devestating, endless words affirming his own domineering role in my life) he would attack me for being 'disrespectful'. 

In his own words, he likes compliant people. In society, he's had a lot of authority for his whole life (patriarchy via the church, patriarchy via the military, patriarchy via being a white male american) so he _has no conceptual framework_ for dealing with someone from a position of mutuality or co-creation. I could fill a book with examples. 

_you deserve to be treated with gentleness, kindness, safety_

Of course 'kids today are not well' when some huge percentage of them are being physically, verbally, emotionally abused at home _and when not at home_ by adults who believe the kids OWE them something. 

> Gosh, Josh, you seem to have beef...

yes, yes I do. I have no interest in supremacists experiencing additional fawning from their own children, as they perpetuate abuse. 

- [The Origins of Proslavery Christianity: White and Black Evangelicals in Colonial and Antebellum Virginia](https://www.amazon.com/Origins-Proslavery-Christianity-Evangelicals-Antebellum/dp/0807858773) 

This book got me good. If you're raised evangelical, you got raised in "pro-slavery christianity", which is _just a regime of social control that glommed around a few old stories_. 

The story of how evangelicals treated people of the global majority in Virginia in the 1600s-1900s reveals everything one needs to know about evangelicalism.

Before the 1600s, people like John Calvin advocated genocide for other groups. The story is basically the story of the Anabaptists, but the Anabaptists that exist today are not relevant, IMO, but the Anabaptists of the 1600s are quite relevant. [here's a bit more on that](https://josh.works/whats-up-with-anabaptists). 

Basically, before the printing press, people that claimed "we have authority over you" could say "because it says so in these books, which are rare, and in languages you cannot read."

Then the printing press came about, and _individual congregations_ started getting bibles, _in their own language_, and said "You know what, this book is interesting, we think we're going to do a little bit of our own interpretation of what these texts mean, instead of exclusively relying upon what 'the church' and 'the state' say about the bible."

That 'we will become our own authority', even though it was coupled with _complete_ non-violence, represented an enormous threat to the political authorities of the day, so John Calvin and others suggested murdering the Anabaptists. Truly.

Soooo it's that willingness to kill for a purported authority, because it is Right, that distinguishes supremacists, evangelicals, and settler-colonialists from others.

Basically settler colonialists commit ethnic cleansing wherever they go, and they'll 'cleanse' the minds of their own children, to try to replicate their own settler colonialism into the world around them.

It's mental and emotional torture.

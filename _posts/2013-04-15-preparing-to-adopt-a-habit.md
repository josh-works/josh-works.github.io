There are many habits I wish I had. More times than I can count, I have tried to get up early. I faithfully set my alarm for some crack-of-dawn time that leaves me with a reasonable amount of sleep, but gives me time to myself before I have to get ready for work.

Almost as many times, my alarm goes off, I hit snooze, it goes off again, I hit snooze again, until either it or I gives up. When it goes off, I keep sleeping. When I give up, I turn off the alarm, and keep sleeping.

When I lived near to (and worked at) a climbing gym, I never struggled to get regular exercise; the greater struggle was, at times, to take a day off from climbing. Since both my occupation and location has changed, I get a small fraction of the exercise I once had.

I would love to get into powerlifting (the only reason I would ever join a real gym) but alas, no gym within twenty minutes of my apartment has a squat rack, or lets you drop weights.

I've never been much of a cook. I also don't eat particularly healthy, but like everyone, I wish I ate healthier food more often for less money. I'm a big fan of the Paleo-ish diet, for a number of reasons. (The "ish" refers to how rigidly I follow the proscribed food choices.)

I eat a healthy breakfast, but that's because if I don't, I'm starved by 10am. I eat sweet potatoes more often than I once did. I enjoy Chipotle that much more, knowing that food is good for me. I eat a little less bread than I once did. This is about how much my eating has changed with the knowledge of what food is good for me, and what food is bad for me.

**Lots of failure, or a little success?**

Compare these two statements:

> I have had far more "failures" than I have had "successes".

> I have had clear instances where I have broken from habit and adopted (briefly) the changes I want to have.

Those two sentences say the same thing.

Right now I am preparing to adopt the above habits.

- I've begun an extremely brief (ten minutes a day) daily workout plan.
- I still try to set my alarm early, and sometimes I wake up on time feeling great.
- I am slowly and with great difficulty learning to cook a variety of healthy meals.

**It is safe to fail**

Habits start out as delicate things. I'm not willing to even call a pattern of mine a habit until it's so entrenched I'm in no danger of losing it. If I call a bunch of little attempts and goals "habits", I have labeled myself "someone who is bad at forming habits."

If I take a step back and try to learn how to build habits, I can freely engage in "habit-building behaviors" without fear of failure. If a habit does not stick, I still learned something, and I can apply it to my next endeavors.

The potential payoff is enormous, and the potential harm is minimal. I'm not putting my self-worth on the line.

What habits are you trying to build, and how do you feel when it does not go according to plan?

[Amazon's e-reader](http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Ereader-ebook-reader/dp/B007HCCNJU) is extremely functional. Most reasons to 
not use one focus either on practical issues (depending on something with a battery) or on aesthetic reasons. These are valid issues, of course, but these pale in comparison to the many, many reasons 
to use a Kindle.

* Extremely portable


* Â Quite compact


* Can hold near-infinite number of books


* Instantly acquire new books.


* Purchased books are cheaper on Kindle than physical books (usually)


* You can "rent" books on your Kindle from a library - without ever going to the library.


* Easy to use one-handed, either lying down (in bed) or standing up (metro).


* Built-in dictionary for all those words you don't know how to use. (Oh, and you can have dictionaries in just about any language.)


* No page-turning - just tap a convenient button that is ambidextrous.


* You can read while eating without your book falling shut.


* You can hold it with one hand 
and turn pages. Simultaneously. Difficult to do with a regular book.


* When not in use, fold the cover shut, and drop it in the thinnest pocket of whatever bag you're carrying with you. (You 
do have a cover for it, right?)


* It weighs less than just about any book you could buy.


* It takes up less space than just about any book you could buy.


* While it does require charging, I find myself charging it less than once a month. (And I use it a lot.)


* You can play games on it, if you're so inclined.


* You can have it for $69.


* It uses the Amazon bookstore. Amazon is awesome.


* It makes reading fun, so you read more than you would otherwise.


* It can hold over a thousand books simultaneously, so you can start slimming down your library.


This is a short list of how I do most of my reading. If you don't have a Kindle yet, look into it. It could change your life.

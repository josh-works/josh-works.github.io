<p>Climb boldly. I've tried to write about this many times, and have *thousands* of words scattered across my computer about this topic. I always felt like I wasn't communicating it quite right. I wasn't happy with it.</p>
<p>So I said "screw it, I'll explain it like I would if I were teaching it in a class."</p>
<p>That's the video below. Well, part of it.</p>
<p>If you're a rock climber, and fear is on your mind, this is for you:</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_146311">Are you an introvert or an extrovert?
Chances are good an answer pops to your mind. Of course you're right! You've taken <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=extrovert+introvert+test&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=fflb">internet tests</a>! You've read Buzzfeed articles describing <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/erinlarosa/problems-only-introverts-will-understand">one aptitude</a> or <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/jessicamisener/frustrating-things-about-being-an-extrovert">the other</a>, and you feel like they speak to you!</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_146323">Stop. Right now. You're speaking lies to yourself.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_146326">How about another question. Are you fit, or are you intelligent?</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_146329">Ah. "You can intelligent <em>and </em>fit", you say. You can train one or the other. Yet don't we usually guide people towards one or the other? Jocks? Geeks?</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_146335">Here's another "dichotomy" that doesn't hold up in the real world - "right brained/left brained". Creative vs. concrete thinkers. But I digress...</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_146338">Josh Spodek blew my mind when he wrote that <a href="http://joshuaspodek.com/introversion-opposite-extroversion">introversion is not the opposite of extroversion</a>. Believing that you are one or the other allows folks to slack of in areas of their life that are difficult. This is a shame, because usually that thing that's the hardest for you is the best way for you to grow in a short period of time.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_146344">If you never exercise, you can realize incredible gains in a short period of time. Your percentage of growth in a month could be ten times that of a professional athlete continuing to train. Along those same lines, if you are all jock, and never do "brainy stuff", you can learn and grow a lot just by finishing a few books.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_146347">This holds true for interpersonal skills. If you can't talk to people IRL, two hours of (difficult but rewarding) effort could mark a turning point in your life.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_146350">If you don't like being alone by yourself, the best thing for you may be sitting alone by yourself.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_146353">Please don't sell yourself, or anyone else, short by believing lies about introversion and extroversion.</p>

<p>There are lots of dead people that we look up to. But people that are alive, and not world-wide famous are a bit more knowable. Some of them will even reply to tweets you send them!</p>
<p>So, here are a few people that I follow and have received TONS of amazing wisdom from. (I recommend getting on all of their email lists.)</p>
<p>They deal with money, jobs, and doing good work:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://twitter.com/ramit">Ramit Sethi</a>, <a href="http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/">I Will Teach</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://twitter.com/brennandunn">Brennan Dunn</a>, <a href="https://doubleyourfreelancing.com/">Double Your Freelancing</a>, which applies not just to freelancers but anyone trying to do good work.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://twitter.com/amyhoy">Amy Hoy</a>, who's "<a href="http://yearofhustle.com/">year of hustle</a>" calendar is a great place to start.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://twitter.com/patio11">Patrick McKenzie</a>, famous around the world for tons of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=patio11">Hacker News</a> comments. A great recent starting point is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11743920">the Daenerys Targaryen test</a>. After that, read <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/greatest-hits/">his blog</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These have been the people I share with anyone when job-related discussions pop up. Jobs <em>technically</em> don't define us, but that's sure hard to tell. If you don't like your job, read the above resources. If you like your job, read the above resources.</p>

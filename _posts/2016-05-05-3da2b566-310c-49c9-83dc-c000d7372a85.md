The first thing I did when making this post is I set it to be published tomorrow.



Then, I left the room for a bit. I didn't have anything to say. Or, I didn't think I did.



Yet, all over my computer, and in various list trackers and note-taking apps, I've got dozens of ideas to write about stashed away. I've got 25 potential posts in various states of done-ness.



All these words, with little pressure to write, but endless reason to refine a little longer.



In other words, a perfect recipe for procrastination.



I miss the habit of the mind of writing. Once I've "cleared the deck" of past things I 
have written, I've got to come up with new things to write. Which means I need to be cognizant of ideas that pass through my head, and I need to flesh them out to something that can be expressed.



Heck, I don't even need to just 
notice ideas, I need to 
have ideas, and then execute on them.



So, here we are, a little after setting this post to be published, with nothing to say.



To my pleasant surprise, it seems I may have said something.

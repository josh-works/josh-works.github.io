<p>Compare this:</p>
<blockquote>Let me know if my criteria are sound, or if you have any concerns. I'd like to get started as soon as possible.</blockquote>
<p>to this:</p>
<blockquote>Unless I hear otherwise, I'm going to start reaching out to the clients that meet my criteria for this research.</blockquote>
<p>If you sent the first option out in an email, you might be waiting a few days to get the go-ahead. The second option, and you can begin immediately.</p>
<p>The difference is night and day.</p>
<p>I first heard of this phrase through this lovely one-page website <a href="http://unlessiheardifferently.com/">unlessiheardifferently.com</a>, and I use it <em>all the time</em>, and have gotten nothing but positive feedback.</p>
<p>Give it a whirl yourself, next time you want to get something rolling and don't want to wait for the explicit permission of those around you. They'll thank you for it.</p>

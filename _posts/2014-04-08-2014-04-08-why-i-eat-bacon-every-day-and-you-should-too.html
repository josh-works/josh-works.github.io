<p>I love breakfast.
Almost every morning for the last three years <strong>I have had a frying pan full of bacon, and three eggs</strong>.</p>
<p>There are plenty of reasons I do this. Every one knows protein is good for you. But that fat... that grease. That cholesterol. I'm going to die young, right?</p>
<p><strong>I don't think so.</strong></p>
<p>Before you dismiss me out of hand, just look through two articles.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2013/02/19/the-definitive-guide-to-bacon/">The Definitive Guide to Bacon</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2013/01/18/how-to-increase-testosterone-naturally/">Art of Manliness "Boost Your Testosterone - Naturally" </a></li>
</ul>
<p>I won't go into it all here, but know this: <strong><em>There is a group of intelligent, scientifically literate people who believe it is good</em><em> for you to eat bacon and eggs every day.</em></strong></p>
<p>If you love bacon, but it's too much work every day to cook - tune in on Thursday. I'm going through my method to remove all friction from the cooking process, and make it the best part of your morning.</p>

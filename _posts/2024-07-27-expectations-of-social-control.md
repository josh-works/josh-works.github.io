_this is still in draft status, obviously_

[Write it now](https://josh.works/write-it-now), obviously. Been discussing this and writing about it and it feels _so fucking obvious_ in some ways.

I've been listening to the strongwilled podcast, and reading them, for a while, and it's good, overall. 

And I think it's missing. I propose that there's some pieces of alternative frames that can get tied together neatly into something nice. 

First, "christians" and "christianness" are not the same things, but there's lots of commonality. Gonna speed run this.

Christianity is tied together with the _ideas_ of social control that led to settler colonialism, but it's all after-the-fact justification for changing balences of power.

"but josh democracy is"... 

> a belief in the concept of 'authority' predisposes you to act like 'social control' is a thing worth having, rather than a tool of ethnic cleansing and should be :vomit: to even reach for. 

what sorta gets called 'whiteness' today feels like the intellectualized version of 'the ideals of landholding european men who had access to the printing press', explaining why colonialism is actually _better for the colonized_. 

It's _really_ obvious in this academic book that I think everyone should go buy right now:

[the origins of pro-slavery christianity: white and black evangelicals in colonial and antebellum virginia](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8236315-the-origins-of-proslavery-christianity)

so, like, oops. 

In my mind, to learn of this book, be able to read it, and not immediately move on it is _unimaginable_ to me. Buy the kindle book or hardcover, I'm honestly shocked it's still in print. _[amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Origins-Proslavery-Christianity-Evangelicals-Antebellum/dp/0807858773)_. [If you click here, you can see in my goodreads account, a long collection of highlights from the book](https://www.goodreads.com/notes/8236315-the-origins-of-proslavery-christianity/27372191-josh-thompson?ref=abp)

at the same time as I was reading this book, I stumbled into the idea that "the very _concept_ of authority is something that constantly gets pushed by oppressors onto their oppressed. So, colonialists v native populations, nobles vs. peasents. There's alternative models than coercion and threats of violence and punishment, _conceptually_. 

As we're moving through here, we can see ways that we are all oppressed, {even protected class}, especially {other class}, and the best thing we can do to stop it is either 1. stop doing hurtful things (holy hell what a win) _or_ Witness it. 

------------

blah blah blah intellectualism josh. tenants of whiteness, skim it and see if it feels right. I noticed that I've feeling bullied by these energies my whole life, and was like 

> oooooh, that's what it feels like to be raised by slaver-type people. They think they are entitled to dominante me as a child, based on our respective roles, and they're still interacting with me and the world in a role-based way, _and it hurt like hell then, and it hurts like hell now_.

I can taste alternatives, in my life, and appreciate how it's not only enjoyable (and, when I'm in a not-angry mood, I can speak extensively about the richness of it all) but it's also often dramatically more full of easy energies. 

Unfortunately, fortunately, once I learned all this, my ability to maintain a strong line in my mind between "oppressor", and those who were merely complicit, diminished. Not in a way I wanted, either. I've got friends who's beliefs technically round to 'supports genocide', and I think in most situations I should have been able to continue easy relating, but this isn't one of them. 

Liiiiiike if enough people took their boots of the necks of others, just a little, we might all be able to breath a bit easier. 

> "take the boot off?"

understand the obvious relationship between things like 'physical violence' and 'emotional violence', and 'physical neglect' and 'emotional neglect'. Things get _really_ broken. 

## Witnessing

We can fix things by Witnessing them. I capitalize it. To see something and name it. Tricky and boring to me to even try to write about, but it might sound like:

> Adults should not hit children, and if they did, should never try to convince the child that the child somehow deserved it or earned it. If that happened, it's unlikely that the adult can then also make plausible claims about loving that child. 

That's not a huge reach, so the next time you see an adult hitting a child, maybe you'll have a chance to pass the message along.

[...]

## The alternative

So, psychological safety needs to be established. There's a few ways to get there, but you cannot get there via coercive methods and stuff.

Sooooo next maybe appreciate that suburbanization was how shitty eugenicists tried to manage stuff like 'maintaining race purity'. 

They wrote about it. Like, R1/single family housing neighborhoods were originally designated as 'white', and r2/multi family was 'colored'. 

SCREAM!

So, any of your listeners who are interacting with zoning regimes right now can start talking about this with others. 

the concept of zoning in America (plus roads that cannot be permanently shut down to cars) is how supremacists of the 50s sorta carved their way through the world. They were willing to do really bad things. 

bollards, everywhere. 



A friend mentioned in passing, and in a sort of humorous way, the various ways human sexuality is discussed in the english, evangelical bible(s), and then of course 'the vibe' that was in the air in evangelicalism. 

I said:

> can you imagine the 'oops' the entire community would have to confront if that bit of text as translated actually read something like 'never rape anyone' instead of 'do not have pre-marital sex'?

I think over-indexing on something like 'does the state dispense a legal document and regime in favor of your current partnership status' causes one to lose sight of 'are you a coercive person? stop being that way' or 'are you being coerced? if so, you deserve not to be, escape or evade as available'.

The entire landscape would change.

So, a hypothetical in the conversation was:

> arguing exclusively within a conventional biblical framework, can you fully discard the entire notion of 'sexual intimacy being reserved for marriage' notion?

I gave an enthusiastic "yes, and I say it's obvious", but only if I get to maintain my dignity by naming, explicitly, when I am staying inside of a given frame."

-------------------------

Agricultural societies are vastly supportive of things like 'legal marriages' and 'hierarchy/patriarchy', especially once the 'society' as intellectually identified itself with growing certain kinds of crops. 

Slave societies in America, and the attempted management/successful regimes of social control maintained _through_ the 'institution of marriage' also play a big role in how evangelicals see marriage today. 

<insert quote about slaves arguing with their oppressors over 'marriage' strictures>

the land of Gaza, and the nomadic tribes living in the region, and the immigrant/non-state peoples before them, had lots of ideosyncratic practices. Evangelicalls generally claim to care about Jesus, so I'll limit my frame exclusively to two people, for two reasons:

1. Jesus, because supposedly his social ethic was normative to people who claim him as figurehead
2. Paul, because whenever Jesus becomes inconveneient to evangelicals, they get a nice pressure release option via Paul, who 'translated' jesus into something consumable for the whole world, today.

---------------

I no longer accept the embedded entitlement of the evangelical narrative around possessing the sex of ones partner, or of ones children (ick), please see dobson/purity conferences evangelicals have still not discussed adequately. 

The way to feel entitled to someone else's personhood, to feel like it's slaved to you, and thus once it's 'given' it cannot be taken back (or something) is very rooted in patriarchy, dominantion, supremacy, violence.

"The Origin of Proslavery christianity: white and black evangelicals in colonial and pre-antebellum virginia" covers it all. Power structures 'change' when they 'choose to', which often is riiiiight before something calamitous happens that causes them to loose more than that small concession, so... evolutions of 'rights' in a hierarchical institution follows the progress and success of the opressed groups to resist the oppressor class. 

children are opressed by adults. within many marriages, women are oppressed by men. The people are oppressed by the police. non-white-passing culture is oppressed and dominated by white-passing culture, in places where people of the global majority are oppressed by violence enacted by some white people of european american heritage. native people are oppressed by colonial people. Wherever there's the concept of race and class, someone's getting oppressed.

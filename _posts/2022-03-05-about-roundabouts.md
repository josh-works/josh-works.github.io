_I'm desperately trying to work through a giant back-log of writings. Please see [write it now]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2021-10-05-write-it-now.md %}) for more. I'm spending only a few minutes on this, forgive my errors._

Of late, I've had a _lot_ of conversations about roundabouts. 

In some cases, I'm learning interesting things about them (or news about how they're interacting with the world today, in March 2022.)

## News and articles

- [These Americans Are Just Going Around in Circles. It Helps the Climate. An Indiana city has the most roundabouts in the country. They’ve saved lives and reduced injuries from crashes — and lowered carbon emissions.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/20/climate/roundabouts-climate-emissions-driving.html)

The above NYT article. This is how I read the occasional NYT article:

## My own mapping projects

I'm working on projects that will touch on many things. Mostly, these are so I can get kick the tires on some software-related challenge, but here's a link to an intersection that would be well served by a tiny traffic circle:

## Examples of "good" and "bad" traffic circles

There are MANY kinds of traffic circles, they have tradeoffs in size, cost, speed, experience, etc.

There's also a lot about traffic circles that isn't really "the job" of the traffic circle, like "how fast is the vehicle going when it approaches a traffic circle". If a car is going "too fast", the traffic circle might not be great, so the stuff that kinda... "connects" traffic circles to each other (and to other non-traffic-circle-things) matters.

## In summary

Everything is tradeoffs, and when things work well, a thoughtful, well-crafted traffic circle is a great way to solve a real problem, and generally everyone who uses it feels good about it. 

When embedded in a healthy mobility network, a well-designed traffic circle casually allows safe travel in all directions, from all directions, for all participants, in a way that is high-throughput and low-wait-time for all users, in all conditions, at all times of day. 

Safely.

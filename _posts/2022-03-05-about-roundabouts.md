_I'm desperately trying to work through a giant back-log of writings. Please see [write it now]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2021-10-05-write-it-now.md %}) for more. I'm spending only a few minutes on this, forgive my errors._

Of late, I've had a _lot_ of conversations about roundabouts. 

In some cases, I'm learning interesting things about them (or news about how they're interacting with the world today, in March 2022.)

## News and articles

- [These Americans Are Just Going Around in Circles. It Helps the Climate. An Indiana city has the most roundabouts in the country. They’ve saved lives and reduced injuries from crashes — and lowered carbon emissions.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/20/climate/roundabouts-climate-emissions-driving.html)

The above NYT article. This is how I read the occasional NYT article:

## My own mapping projects

I'm working on projects that will touch on many things. Mostly, these are so I can get kick the tires on some software-related challenge, but here's a link to an intersection that would be well served by a tiny traffic circle:

## Examples of "good" and "bad" traffic circles

There are MANY kinds of traffic circles, they have tradeoffs in size, cost, speed, experience, etc.

There's also a lot about traffic circles that isn't really "the job" of the traffic circle, like "how fast is the vehicle going when it approaches a traffic circle". If a car is going "too fast", the traffic circle might not be great, so the stuff that kinda... "connects" traffic circles to each other (and to other non-traffic-circle-things) matters.

## Traffic circles can be very low-key, or intense

### low

- tire on the ground, or a rock, or a tree, in the middle of a small intersection

### Medium

- a "square" of at least a few feet, or maybe a casual larger circle

### High

- something intense, multiple lanes for vehicle traffic. The throughput-per-minute probably isn't very good, the rest of the network is strained, it's a bandaid. 

Anything with two+ lanes counts as intense, IMO. I don't really like "intense" traffic circles that much, or, at least, you and I probably agree about things that are not great about them:

## Acoustic benefits

Traffic circles, embedded in healthy networks, don't require too much breaking or accellerating, and they do it in a "gentle" way. Much less vehicle noise, because stop lights and stop signs invite a LOT of aggressive acceleration.

Anyone that lives within a few hundred yards of that intersection is affected by it. Anyone who lives near ANY intersection like this, it invites constant noise, and when the noise isn't constant, it's punctuated by a distinctive sound of vehicle accelleration. Again, personally, might not be you in your vehicle, but someone with a loud car is accellerating hard out of that intersection, it's everpresent. 

The volume and interruption far exceeds any noise coming from people. (Sound system, crowds) and I wish I could petition for "noise treatment" around roads that caused excessive DB readings alongside the road.

## In summary

Everything is tradeoffs, and when things work well, a thoughtful, well-crafted traffic circle is a great way to solve a real problem, and generally everyone who uses it feels good about it. 

When embedded in a healthy mobility network, a well-designed traffic circle casually allows safe travel in all directions, from all directions, for all participants, in a way that is high-throughput and low-wait-time for all users, in all conditions, at all times of day. 

Safely. 

I believe some of the benefits of traffic circles are illegible, but enough are legible and i'll bet money that we'll have a failure to disagree in any way, shape, or form, on traffic circles. 

Email me if you'd like to put that to the test in a public or private way.

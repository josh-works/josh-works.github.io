Since maybe 2018, every now and again I'll purchase a month-long 'subscription' to the [Levels](https://www.levelshealth.com/) service, which is their app paired with a Continuous Glucose Monitor.

It's a tiny wearable device that uses adhesion to stick to your arm for two weeks. It has like a 1cm thin bendble plastic needle that allows it to sample your blood glucose, continuously, store the data onboard, and then when you tap your phone's NFC reader to it, your phone pulls the data off and... renders it. 

## A tiny history 

A continuous glucose monitor is an improved tool on the blood-drawn glucose monitor technology that will be intimately familiar to anyone with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. I have neither, and I'd like to keep it that way.

There's some books I'd like to interject here, that I didn't read all at the same time, but probably read the first time within a year of each other:

- [Tripping over the Truth: How the Metabolic Theory of Cancer Is Overturning One of Medicine's Most Entrenched Paradigms](https://www.amazon.com/Tripping-over-Truth-Overturning-Entrenched/dp/160358935X)
- [The Case against Sugar](https://www.amazon.com/Case-Against-Sugar-GARY-TAUBES/dp/184627639X/)
- [It Starts with the Egg: How the Science of Egg Quality Can Help You Get Pregnant Naturally, Prevent Miscarriage, and Improve Your Odds in IVF](https://www.amazon.com/Starts-Egg-Pregnant-Naturally-Miscarriage/dp/0999676180)
- [Beginner's Guide to Intermittent Fasting (nerdfitness.com)](https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-intermittent-fasting/)

_Tripping Over The Truth_ was the main read. It outlines a common feature among all cancers - the cell energy generation pathway common to healthy cells breaks and the mitochondria start to generate energy via fermenting environmentally available sugar (blood glucose).

There's *ahem* several upstream/downstream implications. These books all are coherent with each other around things like:

- Sugar is not 'just' a calory, it has the same effects on the human body as hormones. You know how when children hit puberty, they change in ways unrelated to how much food they are or are not eating? Sugar has a close-enough effect. 
- Mitochondria _and_ one's gut bacteria all sorta... matter. And can be healthy or unhealthy. 

This layers on top of a change I made to my life in 2015 - I stopped eating breakfast, started doing the 16/8 'intermittent fasting' plan. Basically, I stopped eating breakfast, and moved my breakfest omelette + veggies to my lunchtime meal. 

I dropped so much hassle, food prep, cleaning time from my life, and got nothing but upsides. 

I've been doing this for ten years, so it's habit now. When I eat breakfast (very rarely, only when with others who want to eat breakfast) I always think "wow, I couldn't imagine doing this every day."

I still binge eat like crazy sometimes. I've definately got a partially disordered relationship with food, always did since childhood. I think many people use food to deal with emotional loneliness, and sometimes that is still a thing for me, but that falls outside this exact article. 

I like the idea of semi-regularly doing a 24-36 hour fast, but only occasionally do _maybe_ 22 hour fasts. Dinner one day, don't eat again until about dinner the next day, these are never planned just sometimes happen. When I'm not eating carbs regularly, _i very rarely experience the sensation of hunger_. 

## What the data looks like

[add screenshots of the app]

I simply find it fascinating to see how my body does and does not respond to what I eat. I find it much easier to manage and stay ahead of my desire to binge, because I know I'll be looking at the effect of it on my glucose for a while. 

I really like the feeling of clean eating, and I use the continuous glucose monitor to refine some of my habits around my nutrition.

## Why neither of us need the glucose monitor

The devices are quite expensive. This is the 'gold standard' of medical care for type 1 diabetes medication, so most people pay for these via insurance. It's $100 _per_ two week sensor, or $50/week to get minute-by-minute monitoring of your glucose levels. 

Certainly doable, but not cheap. Thus why I get these only so often. Mostly I manage my own nutrition via my own head, and will and will not binge regardless of the sensor. Sometimes I binge, and don't sweat it, because...

## Strong Defaults Will Win

My two key food defaults:

1. My first meal of the day is not until after noon, and I usually stop eating by 8p, so I get daily '16 hour fasts'. (I don't count the time immediately after eating and while sleeping 'fasting', so really I just push my first meal of the day several hours to lunch time or the afternoon)
2. That meal, which is one of two I'll eat that day, is usually: brocolli, mushroom, spinach, eggs, sardines, lots of olive oil. It's pure healthy fat, enough but not too much protein. No carbs. 

I don't drink anything that has sugar added. Most days the liquids I have are: Water, black coffee (or coffee with 10g of heavy cream), tea. 

I've regularly done low-protein mostly vegetarian keto 'diets' before, and very happily. 

Since my 'default meal' has been almost identical for a decade, and I've shaped it into a delicious and fully keto compliant meal, the difference between me being 'fully keto' and 'not at all keto' is just what I do with my dinner, and if I'm choosing to abstain from sugary, carby, food.

I used to be fully vegetarian, and for a time when my then-partner was trying to become pregnant, we both added small amounts of high-quality protein to our diets. I've retained the occasional consumption of salmon and shrimp, along with the regular consumption of sardines. I never eat chicken, beef, pork, deer, for reasons of ethics and health. 

Who knows if this is working. I'm 35, and have as good of a body composition as I could have, and always have. I've been eating _mostly_ this way since 2015.

Maybe I'll stick a video up here of me making my 'default meal'. It's very easy to scale serving sizes up to feed as many as 6 people at once, or making four or five servings for myself (to store as future meals).

Many, many others have eaten this meal with me, and pretty much everyone says "surprisingly delicious, despite it's unconventinal composition & appearence". 

It's a one-dish meal, of course, and there's zero cleanup. [I have a very refined set of preferences for how I like to use my kitchen](https://josh.works/what-ive-learned-from-cooking-in-36-kitchens-in-the-last-year) 

Effortless ease and excellence is all I want. I encourage you to read the books I mentioned above.

I'm going to weave together talk of land value, and financing, and some of the primitives[^primitive] around financial products. 

[^primitive]: I'll be using in the sense of 'constituent, base components' rather than 'backwards or colonial' sense. 

How much would you pay for a box that lives in your mailbox and delivers $1000 on the first of every month?

Would you pay at least $5000, if you felt _really_ confident that it worked, as expected, as advertised?

If so, you understand _amortized earnings_, and something called their "present value". 





Here's the talk abstract: [RailsConf CFP Draft Notes]( {{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2021-03-27-rails-conf-cfp.md %})

Here's some footnote demos. [^like-this]

Multiline footnote: [^multi-line]

[^multi-line]: This is a multi-line footnote. I can have a long single line of text cross the page and it still renders correctly. I need to hit `[tab][tab]` when starting another line.

    ```ruby
    { pizza_status: :not_enough }
    ```
    It can include all sorts of formatting!
    And images!

There's many objections or questions that you could raise, right now, as you are reading these words. Possibly on your phone[^i-would-never]

[^i-would-never]: I would never, ever, admit to using the bathroom and browsing my phone, saying "yeah, I'll come back to that" and never do.

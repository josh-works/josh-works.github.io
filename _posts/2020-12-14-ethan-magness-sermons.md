I've been recommending a collection of sermons to many people recently.

I've listened to each of these sermons quite a few times. They're worth your time.

Ethan Magness is the rector at [Grace Anglican Church](http://graceanglicanonline.com/) in Grove City, PA.

## Sermon on Matthew 5:43-48

From November 4, 2018: [Gollum & the Outstretched Hand - Matthew 5](http://graceanglicanonline.com/podcast/gollum-the-outstretched-hand-matthew-5/)

Relevant scripture:

> “You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ 
> 
> But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
> 
> If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that?
> 
> And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that?
> 
> Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.

I have far more thoughts on the topic, but for now, this should help you, the reader, find these excellent sermons.

## Todo

- I'd like to get high-quality transcripts of these sermons. There are services that do this (Like [Rev](https://www.rev.com/)), I'll pay for it sometime soon. I want _good_ transcripts, not just AI-generated transcripts. It took me like two hours to clean up a few minutes of AI-generated text for [My Thoughts on Eric Weinstein's Thoughts on Pia Kalani's Thoughts]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2020-08-08-eric-weinstein-quote.md %})

At some point I'll weave together other threads I've got sketched out, but are not ready for public consumption.

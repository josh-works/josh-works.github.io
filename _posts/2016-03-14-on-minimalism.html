<p>I reluctantly call myself a minimalist. I'd prefer to call myself an "enoughalist". </p>
<p>This reluctance is because I think the label brings in a bunch of connotations that I don't like.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-minimalism-">What is Minimalism?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>a removal or decluttering of one’s lifestyle in order to focus on that which is most essential</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is about reducing some things, like consumption, time at work, and possessions and increasing other things, like self-sufficiency, wealth, and {insert thing you want here}.</p>
<p>With the goal of... what? </p>
<p>Lets say you've got lots of things you <em>don't</em> want in your life, and not a lot of things you <em>do</em> want. This is a <em>bad place</em>. So, you adapt changes that reduce the things you don't want, and allow you to add some things you do want. </p>
<p>This is a <em>better place</em>.</p>
<p>There may still be a gap. If you've reduced things and added the things you wanted to add, but still feel discontent, you're in a spot that many others find themselves. This is a <em>good place</em>, because you have to own your discontentment. You can't play the "what if" game and say "if my boss wasn't so bad, and I had a little more money, and a little more time, I'd be happy." </p>
<h2 id="minimalism-is-a-tool-not-the-goal">Minimalism is a Tool, not the Goal</h2>
<p>Some internet-people make minimalism the goal of their lives. I respect them, but don't want to emulate them. People like <a href="http://tynan.com/">Tynan</a>, <a href="http://www.theminimalists.com/archives/#popular">The Minimalists</a>, and others. </p>
<p>Share good tools and tricks. (This is the premise of <a href="http://lifehacker.com">Lifehacker</a>, after all), but don't forget that the tips and tricks are to move you in the direction of a goal. (Speaking of useful tools, if you're a Mac user, check out <a href="http://jumpcut.sourceforge.net/">Jumpcut</a>.) </p>
<p>If minimalism is not the goal, why should anyone pay attention to it, or consider it?</p>
<p>Clearing out trivialities gives you space to evaluate your own life and decisions. The way you work, relax, spend money each involve a decision. If you don't make them consciously, you're probably having them made for you. So, adapt the basic tenants of minimalism (or "enoughism") and you can regain control of the decision making. </p>
<h2 id="what-s-the-goal-">What's the Goal?</h2>
<p>The good news: here's nothing in this world that is fully satisfying. </p>
<p>The bad news: we are slow to believe this. </p>
<p>Others have said it better:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Vanity of vanities", says the Preacher, "vanity of vanities! All is vanity. What does man gain by all the toil at which he toils under the sun?" (Ecclesiastes 1:2-3)</p>
</blockquote>

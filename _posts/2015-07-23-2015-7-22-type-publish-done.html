<p>Yesterday I read <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2015/07/14/how-the-hell-do-i-prioritize-work-blog-find-balance/"><em>How the Hell do I Prioritize Work, Blog &amp; Find Balance.</em></a></p>
<p>The author of the letter is a busy, accomplished guy and still manages to write regularly. </p>
<p>He said, in short “I sit down, and I write. I’ve done it a lot, so I’m not bad at it. I don’t often proof read my stuff, I make grammar and spelling errors, and what I publish is not polished, refined."</p>
<p><em>I’ve been doing it for long enough that I can crank out posts quickly. I don’t worry about typos. I don’t worry about sounding too smart. I don’t worry about every post becoming part of the national treasures. I just write. Usually single sitting. No editing. Hit publish. Sayonara</em></p>
<p>I like that style. “Single Take”. Spill what’s on your mind and hit publish.</p>
<p>I get caught up in editing, making things be just right, putting out “amazing content” that I just write literally nothing. Nothing at all. There are times and places for great content, but this is not it. I don't need a great banner image. (Cropped to look great full-width, of course, and something with text over it to look good for social media sites...)</p>
<p>Is money changing hands? (Or are you hoping to convince someone to buy something?) Great, do a round of editing. Make sure that what you are talking about is resonating. But this is not that.  </p>

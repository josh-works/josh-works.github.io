<p>We all probably have a few projects floating around our head, but they seem daunting.
If it doesn't seem daunting, it's not much of a project, and you should either ramp it up until it's daunting, or discard it.</p>
<p>So - we have a daunting project. Now what? If you're like me, you'll fart around on the internet for a little while, doing "research". You may take a few, or even many, steps in a certain direction. You'll possibly feel good about it for a little while.</p>
<p>But when the enthusiasm fades, you stop the work.</p>
<p>There are many reasons to stop work on a project. Some of them are good ones. It seems like a waste of time doing work on something you don't want to do! But if you do want to do it, and can't, what's going on?</p>
<p>I submit this: Without a clear definition of success, it is <em>impossible</em> to actually succeed.</p>
<p>Half the battle is defining success. So, step one of a project should be: Define success.</p>

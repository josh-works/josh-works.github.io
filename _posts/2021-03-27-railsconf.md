Did this talk resonate and you want to implement some of the ideas at your company? I might be able to help. Shoot me an email at `joshthompson@hey.com` or book some time to talk at https://calendly.com/joshthompson/coffee.

This talk is available on `railsconf.org`, here: [https://railsconf.org/watch/bettering-our-industry/junior-devs-are-the-solution-to-many-of-your-problems](https://railsconf.org/watch/bettering-our-industry/junior-devs-are-the-solution-to-many-of-your-problems)

I've only just started systematizing resources around this. I'd love to talk with _you_ about your thoughts on these resources. Use the `coffee` link above, or if there's no availability _and_ this is an issue you're willing to throw money at, book time on a much more flexible calendar here: [https://calendly.com/joshthompson/flexible](https://calendly.com/joshthompson/flexible)

I'm a month into creating public resources to create a "path" by which an ECSD can grow to a non-ECSD. Follow along here: [https://github.com/sponsors/josh-works](https://github.com/sponsors/josh-works)

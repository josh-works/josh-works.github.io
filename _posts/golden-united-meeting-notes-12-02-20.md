Bi-monthly webinars, looking to gather support. Publicise it and co-sponsor a series of webinars. Looking to reinvigorate the group. 

Tom's webinars focusing on:
1. Talking about mental health is an important thing.
2. Mental health issues (and discussing them) is helpful for communities.
3. Identify for people resources that they can take advantage of.

question: who gives the webinars
answer: ideally jeffco professionals, might be someone else.

Don: We'll consider a partnership over the year w/GCP, esp. as it intersects with housing issues, will bring it up w/Board at next board meeting. 


Kathy: Updates on the year - Golden United is up for a grant from Jeffco to help mobile park residents know about new laws in the state re: tenant rights

Set up meetings w/residents, put them in touch

Colorado poverty law project.

## Rental Assistance

Rental assistance requests, $20k/mo in requests for residents. 

Looking to raise money for Salvation Army, bell ringing, requests for donations.

Colorado State Legislature just did a special session, state came out with 

Landlords can apply on behalf of tenants.


- $54mm in housing assistance. 
- $5mm for undocumented persons 
- $1m for eviction legal defense fund.
- $5m for utility 

CDC has nation-wide eviction moritorium, Polis has an eviction moritorium, banned late fees. Govener has decided to re-instate eviction moritorium.

Note from Josh: Could Golden United use grant money to make it easier for the housing assistance to be deployed in the rental parks. 


# Land Trust Overview

Mater looking at Elevation Community Land Trust, poorer people can sell land under their homes, and the land trust keeps it, pays the residents, who get some cash to build...


Dec 10 city council meeting, someone from the land trust will be there to chat. 

Liana Major & Kathy Smith had meeting w/mayor. 

She might be doing her own thing, meeting didn't unfold exactly as hoped. 

Balance housing affordability program in Golden. 

Not total overlap between Golden United and mayor's goals. Kathy suggests something easy, on a platter, that doesn't cost a lot of money. 

Don sharing context:

Since 2008, there's been projects that have needed funding. 

target spending: 
- $1mm/yr to be bonded into $20mm, but size of market and mis-match between incomes and costs is substantial. 

Preservation issues. Rent subsidies. 

Mobile home parks are a big part of preservation. 700 units in Golden, which is almost 1/10th of the housing stock in Golden. 

Affordable housing target definitions:

Don sharing 2020 income levels, affordable housing is defined as a certain percentage of that income level. 

area median income based on household size

a 1br would be affordable at $1750.

Affordable housing is a politically sensitive topic, even though all the studies and evidence show that affordable housing seems to raise property values. 


Talk with the city, talk with mines, about educational initiatives around students living with seniors/city.

Little things make a difference, are more attainable, so we should be thinking about big projects _and_ small projects, which pick up momentum. 

Mike: When in school, rented a room in a nice house with a family. But now when people rent rooms, the city taxes it. If this gets done, the city should make sure that they're not discouraging the arrangement with taxes or permit fees. 

More funding, more funding. 

One resident had a chance to rent a house out to 9 people, turned it down. This was a good thing? Wouldn't that have provided affordable housing?

More money for rent...

Salvo, Calvary Chapel.

Food insecure

School of Mines has no data on housing affordability w/students

Top-line goal: Education

Preserve mobile home parks

January - put dates/names to projects, and figure out how to get resources. 

Kathy suggesting that they send out a survey. 

Dendy: Talk w/Peter Han

Heading Home - concerned with ending homelessness, Golden is just getting a "homeless navigator", sharing w/other cities. 

Homeless navigator coordinates with a county-wide person who's redoing a plan to focus on homelessness. 

Golden's been reticient to provide good services for homeless persons. 


Josh: Talk more w/ Kathy Smith on affordable housing efforts, what is the definition of "housing affordability"

Laura wants to establish "one focus program", deal w/funding later.

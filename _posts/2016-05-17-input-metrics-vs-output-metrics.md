It's tempting to track results, when trying to accomplish something.




If you're working on any project of sufficient size, the results will come
slowly, fitfully, and sometimes not at all.




So, don't track results, track your efforts. (Yes, how very American of me.
I don't believe in participation awards, or helicopter parenting, etc. Bear
with me.)




Time box your efforts (one month is a nice period of time) and then do your
"input" for one month. At the end of the month, step back and look for the
results.




But don't do the thing a few times, and expect results quickly. That's an
easy way to get frustrated.

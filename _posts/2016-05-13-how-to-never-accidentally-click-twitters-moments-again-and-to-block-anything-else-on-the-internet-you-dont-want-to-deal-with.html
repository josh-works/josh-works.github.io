<p>Do you use Twitter's "Moments" tool, or do you just find it really annoying?</p>
<p>Most people find it annoying. Here's how to get rid of Twitter's "Moments" forever:</p>
<p><strong>0. Be won over to using an ad blocker on the internet. </strong><br>They don't block just ads, but malicious scripts and bandwidth-hogging junk. I'm a huge fan, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5649025/why-you-should-use-adblock-plus-even-if-you-dont-block-ads">so is Lifehacker</a>. <a href="http://thisinterestsme.com/adblock-bad-thing-people-use-selfish/">Others are not</a> </p>
<p><strong>1. Install uBlock Origin. </strong><br>Here's links for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm/reviews?hl=en">Chrome</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">Firefox</a>, and... the jury is still out for a good ad blocker for Safari.<br><br>Already using AdBlock Plus? "uBlock is lighter/quicker than ABP" - <a href="http://lifehacker.com/ublock-is-a-fast-and-lightweight-alternative-to-adblock-1625246461">Lifehacker</a><br><br>(There's a big kerfuffle about uBlock vs. uBlock Origin. I just <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ublock/comments/32mos6/ublock_vs_ublock_origin/">trust the internet</a> and went with uBlock Origin.)<br><br><strong>2. Click the uBlock icon, and click the eye dropper tool. </strong><br>The tool label is "Enter Element picker mode"</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong><strong>Move the element picker to the <em>entire</em> "Moments" section. </strong><br>(Not just the text or the icon)</p>
<p><strong>4. Click it (or any section of the page you want to hide)</strong><br>You know you want to. You won't break anything. Once you click it - the thing you clicked? It's GONE!</p>
<p><strong>5. On the tooltip that pops up in the bottom right of your screen, mouse over it, and click "create"</strong></p>
<p>Here's a gif of using uBlock:</p>

<p>If you make a mistake, no sweat. Right click on the uBlock icon&gt;options&gt;my filters&gt;delete the rule you don't want&gt;apply changes</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Done! Never get frustrated clicking into "Moments" again!</p>
<p>You can use it elsewhere, too.</p>
<p>For example, email "subscribe now" popups can get annoying.</p>
<p>I've subscribed to a newsletter (<a target="_blank" href="http://kopywritingkourse.com/blog/">Kopywriting Kourse</a>, if you must know), and when I click a link in the emails I receive, I get more popups asking me to join the newsletter! So, I use uBlock to permanently hide the popup:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>That's all. Hopefully this is useful!</p>
<p>PS: The controversy about ad blockers makes me think about advertising as a huge mis-allocation of resources for modern man. I'll expand on this some day.</p>

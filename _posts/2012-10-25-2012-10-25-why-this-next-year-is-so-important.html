<p>The end of November is a strange time to consider the next year of life. I should be doing this on my birthday, or late December, right?
Wrong. I have joined the ranks of the unemployed, and I think this is a grand opportunity. This next year is so important because <i>I must not waste this opportunity</i>! If I blindly pursue having a job for the sake of having a job, I fail to maximize my opportunity. If I lament, whine, and complain about not having a job, I fail to maximize this opportunity.<!--more--></p>
<p>This next year is formative in many respects. I will lay down important financial foundations, make career decisions, and learn to better love my wife. The question is not "Will I lay down foundations and build habits" but "what sort of foundations and habits will I create?"</p>
<p>What sort of habits have you built in the last month, and what would you like to change next month?</p>

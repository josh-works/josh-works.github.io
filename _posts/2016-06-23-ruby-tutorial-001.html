<p>I'm playing with <a href="http://www.michaelhartl.com/">Michael Hartl's</a> <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning#sec-installing_rails">Learn Enough Ruby</a> book. </p>
<p>I'll throw basic things I learn along the way on here. </p>
<p>A good starting point is using your command line. I use <a href="https://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a> for my terminal instead of the default Terminal installation. </p>
<p>To get up and running in your terminal, you <em>might</em> start using <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>. It'll install programs you will want/need easily, and keep them up to date. Lots of tools you need have installation instructions that says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To install:<br><code>brew install wget</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which means, in your terminal, type <code>brew wget</code> and Homebrew will install the application, all dependencies, <em>and will keep it up to date</em>. </p>
<p>How do you install Homebrew? Per their instructions, copy-paste the following to your terminal:</p>
<p><code>/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)</code></p>
<p>So, your first program to download can be iTerm2. Once brew is installed, type this into your terminal:</p>
<p><code>brew install iterm2</code></p>
<p>And you've got it installed!  </p>

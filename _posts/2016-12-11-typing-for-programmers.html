<p>If you had to distill my ability to bring value to those around me, it would be "Josh types good".</p>
<p>I can press these magical little keys on this little metal box here, and make these words come out.</p>
<p>If you're reading these words, you don't care how these words actually <em>got on this page</em>. You don't care if I used speech-to-text, transcription, hunt-and-pecked, or if my keyboard layout is QWERTY, Dvorak , or Colemak.</p>
<p>All that matters is that I can express reasonable ideas reasonably well. (Or, as I prefer, <em>unreasonable</em> ideas, reasonably well.)</p>
<p>You, too, probably spend a bit of your time behind a keyboard.</p>
<p>I've already spent time trying to improve my typing speed. After <a href="https://josh.works/blog/2014/07/16/learn-to-type-again">ill-fated attempts at converting myself to using the Colemak keyboard layout</a>, but I gave up, except <a href="https://josh.works/blog/2014/07/16/stop-yelling-on-the-internet-or-a-better-use-for-the-caps-lock-key">I kept my CAPS LOCK key mapped to DELETE</a>.</p>
<p>That was a reasonable position to find myself, except now I'm getting into this whole "programming" thing. That means I have to familiarize myself with that part of my keyboard I've so far avoided.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>[] {} |\\| #{'word_that_means_something'} &amp;&amp; |other| arcane.keys.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don't forget your symbols! </p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>!@#$%&amp;* ()- _ =+&lt;&gt;) \\` ~\`.</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>I ultimately need to be able to use every single one of those keys without thinking about it, without looking at the keyboard, <em>and</em> without looking at what I'm typing to verify that it's correct.</p>
<p>(For example, if you're reading documentation or code on one part of your screen, typing something into some other program, you cannot be looking at what you're typing <em>and</em> what you're <em>supposed</em> to be typing simultaneously.)</p>
<h2 id="how-have-i-learned-to-type-all-these-crazy-symbols-">How have I learned to type all these crazy symbols?</h2>
<p>Two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Typing.io</li>
<li>Changed my passwords </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="typing-io">Typing.io</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="https://typing.io/">typing.io</a> bills itself as "Typing Practice for Programmers"</li>
</ol>
<p>You can pick a language you want to learn (like Ruby, Python, C++, etc) and then presents you with real live code, that you type along with.</p>
<p>Typing.io doesn't solve everything, though, because there are still common code combinations that are hard to learn without lots of repetition.</p>
<p><em>a lesson from the Ruby track. Have you EVER used the <code>|</code> key? NO!</em></p>
<p>So, that brings us to method number 2:</p>
<h3 id="changed-my-passwords">Changed my passwords</h3>
<ol>
<li>Change commonly used passwords to require hard-to-type code snippets.</li>
</ol>
<p>I first got creative with changing my passwords after reading <a href="https://medium.com/@manicho/how-a-password-changed-my-life-7af5d5f28038#.c43eyodf2">How a Password Changed My Life</a>. I'd remind myself to get up early, (when that was hard, I reminded myself to <em>go to bed early</em>).</p>
<p>I cannot say that I've transformed my life through creative passwords, but I stumbled across using them to improve my typing. </p>
<p>I've got two passwords that I often type:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>My computer password, because I've got my computer set to sleep if there's no activity for five minutes (it requires a password upon waking up)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1Password Password Manager. Any time I want to log into a system that requires a password (so, about fifteen different systems during the normal workday), I have the password saved to 1Password, and if it has been inactive for five minutes, it locks itself.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>here I am using hard-to-remember keys, over and over and over</em></p>
<p>For both systems, I create unique passwords that require me to get good with different pieces of code.</p>
<p>In the past, I've used it to train the #, %, **, &amp;&amp; symbols, as well as [] and {}. I'm now comfortable with #{} and [&amp;&amp;]. Soon, I'll rotate them again to incorporate more "sticky" keys that I struggle with.</p>
<p>As I get deeper into my studies, anytime I encounter a difficult key combination (like hitting <code>=</code> right after my pinky is otherwise engaged with a <code>'</code> or <code>|</code> key) I jot it down, to use next time I update my passwords. </p>

_Note from author: This is part of an experimental series, more-or-less based on "white papers" and academic literature, as applied to somewhat practical-ish domains._

_These pages serve as a brief overview of a paper, and I'll be able to link to this paper down the road when I what to be able to do so, without having to repeat all of this information_

## Title: `Driven by Compression Progress: A Principle that explains <many interesting phenomina>`

Official title: _Driven by Compression Progress: A Simple Principle Explains Essential Aspects of Subjective Beauty, Novelty, Surprise, Interestingness, Attention, Curiosity, Creativity, Art, Science, Music, Jokes_

[Paper on arxiv.org, PDF available for free therein](https://arxiv.org/abs/0812.4360)

Here's the paper abstract, lightly reformatted for readability:

> I argue that data becomes temporarily interesting by itself to some self-improving, but computationally limited, subjective observer once he learns to predict or compress the data in a better way, thus making it subjectively simpler and more beautiful. 
> 
> Curiosity is the desire to create or discover more non-random, non-arbitrary, regular data that is novel and surprising not in the traditional sense of Boltzmann and Shannon but in the sense that it allows for compression progress because its regularity was not yet known. 
> 
> This curiosity drive maximizes interestingness, the first derivative of subjective beauty or compressibility, that is, the steepness of the learning curve. 
>
> It motivates exploratory infants, mathematicians, composers, artists, dancers, comedians, yourself, and (since 1990) artificial intelligence.

I read this mid-2019:

Yeah, I know, it was hard for me to read the first time too. I had to re-read bits of the abstract a few times, and it makes reference to obscure things, like when he said:

> data that is novel and surprising but not in the traditional sense of Boltzmann and Shannon...

Do you know that reference? I have no idea who Boltzmann is, but I happen to know who Shannon is, and _because I know what is being implied_ this entire paper takes on a new light. 

I know what's being implied because I happened to have read [A Mind At Play: How Claude Shannon Invented the Information Age](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32919530-a-mind-at-play) and far more on topics related to information theory. 

### Related to Claud Shannon

An understanding of how Claude Shannon understood "information compression" sheds light on other forms of compression, as they compare/contrast, like:

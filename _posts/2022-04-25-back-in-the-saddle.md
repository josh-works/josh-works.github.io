It's been a hell of a year. I've got about 10,000 things I've wanted to write about, and have not gotten around to any of them. Here's my various top-level reasons for not writing:

- what I want to write about feels too complicated to express easily/coherently
- I feel like I'd have too do too much context-setting to get to what I _really_ wanna write about
- I'm too sad/depressed/numb to care about writing
- when feeling sad/depressed/numb, it feels _deeply wrong_ to draw attention to oneself
- feels like anything I'd write would need a million footnotes, asterisks, and qualifying statements to say anything interesting/true enough

Incidentally, however, writing is _deeply cathartic_ for me. Also, _this is my website_. I can say whatever I want.

So, here's my reasons for why I am going to _start_ writing:

- I owe no one anything, so if I want to write a piece that assumes background knowledge about, say, the history of how zoning was 'invented' in the USA, I can write it. If it's too spicy of a take, and someone takes issue with it, well, welcome to the internet,
- I desperately need to get some projects i'm working on out of my head and on paper
- I'm juggling big projects and small projects. writing _always_ clarifies my thinking and next steps.

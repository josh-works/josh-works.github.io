<p>Do you have any big audacious goal you want to accomplish?</p>
<p>If you think back to Jan 1, 2016, what were your goals?</p>
<ul>
<li>Lose weight/get in shape</li>
<li>Make more money/start budgeting</li>
<li>Learn a language</li>
<li>Learn a skill</li>
<li>Read more</li>
<li>Stop doing something (smoking, drinking)</li>
</ul>
<p>Statistically, all of these efforts failed within the first few weeks of 2016.</p>
<p>I believe that May 16th, 2016, is a far better day for a SHORT exploratory period of a goal.</p>
<h2>You won't complete bad goals</h2>
<p>None of the items in the above list meet the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria">criteria of a good goal</a>. A good goal needs to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific</li>
<li>Measurable</li>
<li>Assignable</li>
<li>Realistic</li>
<li>Time-related</li>
</ul>
<p>(See the acronym those words make? SMART. heh)</p>
<p>A nice time-period for me is a month.</p>
<p>I can do something regularly for a month, and I am <em>way</em> more motivated to give it a good go than think to myself "well, today's the first day of a new thing that I want to do, and I'm going to do it <em>every day for the rest of my life.</em></p>
<p>(Easy example is right now I'm publishing something every day. For a month. I'm about half way through. No way I would be motivated to stick with this for a year, or the rest of my life)</p>
<h2>Failure to keep a goal provides valuable insight</h2>
<p>If most Americans have a New Years resolution, you can be sure that most of <em>those</em> Americans then guilt themselves some time later about not actually completing the resolutions.</p>
<p>They shouldn't. We have a powerful sense of inertia in our life, and this keeps us powering through the day-to-day without any major problems. It's a <em>good thing</em> that we can't rewrite our habits quickly or easily. It's just also a frustrating thing.</p>
<p>Don't be frustrated that your habit didn't stick. Press into that frustration and dig into "why did the habit not stick?". <a href="http://josh.works/blog/2013/05/03/intentional-habit-building">I'm of the opinion that habits only work if you make it <em>really really easy</em> to keep the habit</a>, but this front-loads the effort of making a new habit, which is hard.</p>
<p>Plan on failing. Since failure provides information, don't beat yourself up over it, just regroup, re-evaluate, and give it another go.</p>
<h2><em>Time-boxing lets you (makes you?) decide where you want to be in a month</em></h2>
<p>I've been trying to learn French recently, and trying to improve my Spanish. It's not plausible to do these simultaneously, and "improve my {language}" is a <em>terrible</em> goal.</p>
<p>So, today, I told my French-speaking language buddy I needed to postpone our next session by a month, so I could spend time on Spanish. Then, in a month, I'll take a few days of a "break", and move back into French mode.</p>
<p>This makes me feel <em>very</em> motivated to make progress in Spanish, because I'm "time boxed", and once this month is through, it'll be at least another six weeks before I practice my Spanish again.</p>
<p>So, I'm going to work on Spanish for 30 days. Coming soon is "How I find native Spanish speakers to practice with." (It has nothing to do with being in a Spanish speaking country)</p>

## Git Push, Git Paid

Here's the "Git Push, Git Paid" t-shirt I mentioned:

![git push git paid](/images/git_push_git_paid.jpg)

[Thoughtbot designed these](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/git-push-git-paid), and it looks like they're still [available for purchase on CottonBureau](https://cottonbureau.com/products/git-push-git-paid#/1134672/tee-men-standard-tee-vintage-black-tri-blend-s) for $28. 


## Slow Query lookup:

check to see what your current values are for [`long_query_time`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_long_query_time)

```sql
SELECT
  start_time
  ,user_host
  ,query_time
  ,sql_text
  ,lock_time
  ,rows_sent
  ,rows_examined
  ,db
  ,last_insert_id
  ,insert_id
  ,server_id
  ,thread_id
FROM
  mysql.slow_log
WHERE
  start_time >= DATE_ADD(current_timestamp, INTERVAL -1 DAY)
  ORDER BY
    query_time DESC
LIMIT 10000;
```

### What is Benchmarking and Profiling

> Profiling and benchmarking are flip sides of the same coin, profiling helps you to narrow down to where optimization would be most useful, benchmarking allows you to easily isolate optimizations and cross-compare them.

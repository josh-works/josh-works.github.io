description: "Notes from working through Chapter 6 ('Acquiring Behavior Through Inheritance') of _Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby_, by Sandi Metz. It took a few read-throughs of the chapter, plus modifying the code several times from beginning to end, for me to fully understand the principles of the Template Method pattern. I'm making these notes for future versions of me, and perhaps you."

I'm reading through [Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13507787-practical-object-oriented-design-in-ruby).

These are some notes from chapter 6, _Acquiring Behavior Through Inheritance_; mostly these are for me, and they don't intend to stand on their own. Read the book, work through chapter six, and _then_ come back and read through this. 

The current state of the code is we have this `RoadBike` object and `MountainBike` object that share significant code. 

We're going to extract common functionality into the `Bycycle` superclass. 

Step one, according to Sandi Metz, is _always move code from the base class to super class_, never start with code in the super class.

```ruby
class Bicycle
  # Please note how empty this class is.
end

class MountainBike < Bicycle
  attr_reader :size, :front_shock, :rear_shock
  def initialize(args)
    @size         = args[:size]
    @front_shock  = args[:front_shock]
    @rear_shock   = args[:rear_shock]
  end
  
  def spares
    { chain:      '10-speed',
      tire_size:  '2.1',
      rear_shock: rear_shock
    }
  end
end

class RoadBike < Bicycle
  attr_reader :size, :tape_color
  def initialize(args)
    @size       = args[:size]
    @tape_color = args[:tape_color]
  end
  
  def spares
    { chain:      '10-speed',
      tire_size:  '23',
      tape_color: tape_color }
  end
end

mtb = MountainBike.new(
  size:        'small',
  front_shock: 'manitou',
  rear_shock: 'fox'
)
road = RoadBike.new(
  size:       'large',
  tape_color: "Red",
)
```

We have three broad goals:
1. Clean up the initialization methods, so the sub-classes have sensible defaults
2. Clean up the `spares` method, so sub-classes have sensible defaults
3. Accomplish 1 and 2 in such a way that the next developer who adds a sub-class doesn't have to inspect the existing classes in great detail to figure out subtle nuance.

------------------------

## First, a sub-optimal refactor for `#initialize`

First with adding `@tire_size` to the `Bicycle` superclass:

```ruby
class Bicycle
  attr_reader :size
  def initialize(args)
    @size = args[:size]
  end
end
```

and we have to call `super` from the sub-class initialize method, in order to get all of our `instance variables` initialized:

```ruby
class MountainBike < Bicycle
  attr_reader :front_shock, :rear_shock
  def initialize(args)
    @front_shock  = args[:front_shock]
    @rear_shock   = args[:rear_shock]
    super(args) # we need this to get size from the superclass, otherwise we lose the `@size` instance variable
  end
end
  
class RoadBike < Bicycle
  attr_reader :tape_color
  def initialize(args)
    @tape_color  = args[:tape_color]
    super(args)
  end
end
```

We've created a problem, now.

Every new subclass of `Bicycle` that we might ever make needs to call `super` in the initialization method. That's a subtle requirement, and _not_ one that will be immediately apparent to future developers. 

## Use `post_initialize` instead of `initialize`

To navigate this requirement that subclasses never call `super`, we'll strip our entire `initialize` method out of our subclass. 

Here's what we end up with next:

```ruby
class Bicycle
  attr_reader :tire_size
  def initialize(args)
    @tire_size = args[:tire_size] || default_tire_size
    post_initialize(args)
  end
  
  def post_initialize(args)
    nil
  end
end

class MountainBike < Bicycle
  attr_reader :front_shock, :rear_shock
  def post_initialize(args)
    @front_shock  = args[:front_shock]
    @rear_shock   = args[:rear_shock]
  end
  .
end
```

No calls to `super`, and future developers, when looking at either the `Bicycle` class or one of its existing sub-classes _immediately_ see what's going on, and follow the existing pattern. 

Future subclasses can now follow the pattern of existing subclasses. They won't create an `initialize` method, but instead will implement a hook that responds to `post_initialize`.

# Setting sensible defaults

Lets step back to the state of the class, pre-refactor, when we had a `spares` method in both sub-classes, which contained values we'd rather set as defaults, like `chain`, which is currently the same value across all `Bicycle` subclasses, and `tire_size` which differs by sub-class

```ruby
class Bicycle
  # empty again
end

class MountainBike < Bicycle
  .
  def spares
    { chain:      '10-speed',
      tire_size:  '2.1',
      rear_shock: rear_shock }
  end
end

class RoadBike < Bicycle
  .
  def spares
    { chain:      '10-speed',
      tire_size:  '23',
      tape_color: tape_color }
  end
end
```

Here's the first round of refactors. 

We pull `chain` into the superclass, fetching the value of `default_chain` if `Bicycle` isn't explicitly given a `chain` value.

`default_tire_size` is trickier; we _require_ every `Bicycle` subclass to implement `default_tire_size`, since it's not implemented in the superclass:

```ruby
class Bicycle
  attr_reader :chain, :tire_size
  def initialize(args={})
    @chain     = args[:chain]     || default_chain
    @tire_size = args[:tire_size] || default_tire_size
  end
  def default_chain
    '10-speed'
  end    
  
  def spares
    { chain: chain,
      tire_size: tire_size}
  end
end

class MountainBike < Bicycle
  .
  def default_tire_size
    '2.1'
  end
end

class RoadBike < Bicycle
  .
  def default_tire_size
    '23'
  end
end
```

When we give `RoadBike` and `MountainBike` a `default_tire_size` method, the superclass may now call `default_tire_size` and set it appropriately.

We've created a trap, however. From the book:

> The root of the problem is that `Bicycle` imposes a requirement upon its subclasses that is not obvious from a glance at the code. As `Bicycle` is written, subclasses _must_ implement `default_tire_size`. Innocent and well-meaning subclasses like `RecumbentBike` may fail because they do not fulfill requirements of which they are unaware. 

We can remove this trap, though, in the superclass, by telling all future developers that they need to implement certain methods. 

```ruby
class Bicycle
  .
  def default_tire_size
    raise NotImplementedError, "this #{self.class} cannot respond to 'default_tire_size'"
  end
end
```

Now when the new class is initialized, rather than simply failing to set a `tire_size` value, we'll explicitly halt execution and tell them exactly what method they need to add.

--------------------

Phew. All this work, and we've still not fully fixed our `spares` method. 

We've got this `spares` method in the superclass, now using our handy sensible defaults:


```ruby
class Bicycle
  attr_reader :chain, :tire_size
  def initialize(args={})
    @chain     = args[:chain]     || default_chain
    @tire_size = args[:tire_size] || default_tire_size
  end
  
  def default_chain
    '10-speed'
  end    
  
  def spares
    { chain: chain,
      tire_size: tire_size}
  end
  
  def default_tire_size
    raise NotImplementedError, "this #{self.class} cannot respond to 'default_tire_size'"
  end
end

class MountainBike < Bicycle
  .
  def spares
    super.merge(
      front_shock: front_shock,
      rear_shock: rear_shock
      )
    end
end

class RoadBike < Bicycle
  .
  def spares
    super.merge(tape_color: tape_color)
  end
end
```

By now, you should feel skeptical of calls to `super`. We want to avoid causing confusion with future developers about what classes should implement the `spares` method, and what it should do.

The fix is easy, once you see it written out. We're going to expect our classes to implement `local_spares`, and we'll simply ask our superclass to merge those `local_spares` into its own hash, like so:

```ruby
class Bicycle
  .  
  def spares
    { chain: chain,
      tire_size: tire_size}.merge(local_spares)
  end
  
  def local_spares
    {}
  end
end

class MountainBike < Bicycle
  def local_spares
    { front_shock: front_shock,
      rear_shock: rear_shock }
  end
end
```

# The `Template Method` Pattern

I had to read this chapter four or five times before it all sunk in, then I had to manually convert the classes from "tightly coupled and bad" to "appropriately abstract" three or four times for this to all sink in, at the _very basic level of this example_. 


Anyway, this `Template Method Pattern` seems to mean:

> Where abstract superclasses and their sub-classes share methods, the superclass must be explicit about what the subclasses must do. 
> 
> If the superclass provides a globally-available method (like some default value) that _can_ be overridden (or 'specialized') by the sub-class, no further action need be taken by the superclass
> 
> If the superclass _requires_ a method value (like the subclass providing some specific default value or specialization) it ought to raise an error if that default value is not specialized. 
> 
> Is it a rule of thumb that the subclasses never have an `initialize` method? it seems the superclass will call the subclasses with some sort of `post_initialization` method, rather than the subclasses calling `super` after initializing themselves. 
> 
> Subclasses ought to provide _specializations_ on the superclass, rather than ever overriding specific superclass attributes. 


I'd love to come up with a repository of drills or exercises to practice refactoring code according to this `Template Method` design pattern.

Some day, later.

<p>Have you ever sat down at your computer, intent on knocking out one specific task, then finding yourself wondering how you spent the last 20 minutes, and you <em>still</em> did not finish what you tried to do?
I sat down fifteen minutes ago with an idea about something to write. It wasn't a blog post, but it involved writing. I started writing this thing first a few weeks ago, and have touched on it here and there since then. I planned on doing a lot more tonight.<!--more--></p>
<p>But then I checked Facebook. And read some articles from the <em>excellent</em> <strong></strong>Signals vs. Noise blog. (<a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1619-theres-always-time-to-launch-your-dream">This is a good read</a>, but ironic, sort of) and <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1748-forget-the-resume-kill-on-the-cover-letter">this</a> (especially if you're looking at getting hired somewhere), and <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2671-at-tedxmidwest-jason-explains-why-the-office">watch this</a>, and if you manage people, read <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3461-b-environment-merits-b-effort">these</a> two <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2888-real-time-vs-slow-time-and-a-defense-of-sane-work-hours">articles</a>.</p>
<p>So... I just wasted the time I set apart of doing a quick burst of creative work.</p>
<p>PS I just read <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/11/how_elite_firms.html">this article about super-competitive jobs</a> at top-tier financial and management consulting companies, and had to adjust my title from "I just wasted twenty minutes" to "I just wasted twenty five minutes".</p>
<p>PPS I want to feel guilty, but I'm fighting that. I'm not sure why.</p>

I've recently been engaging with people who have built into their sense of self the "rightness" of adults hitting children, while at the same time rejecting the possible rightness of children hitting adults. 

This was brought into _hilarious_ and tragic relief for me recently.

For some context setting, my parents read and embodied the ideologies of a man (of course) named James Dobson, who was a eugenicist, and taught that parents, if they suitably controlled the behaviors and thoughts of their children, could 'raise' them to be good members of a civil society. (European american settler colonialism). 

Settler colonialists use ethnic cleansing as a primary tool for accomplishing their goals, because it works pretty well,_obviously_. 

So, the kinds of people that would support population confinement and displacement, on the concept of 'race', make for interesting parents. Settler colonialists use violence and coercion to get what they want. Violence is expensive and risky, so sometimes other, 'gentler' forms of coercion can be made effective. Economic coercion, for instance, might seem gentler than knocking someone's house over with a bulldozer, but usually _before_ the bulldozer arrives, there's been plenty of economic coercion. 

The bulldozer shows up only if the other methods are deemed to have failed.

This is the core, fundamental dangerous attitude of all people who concede the correctness of the concept of 'spanking', but really the concept of 'punishment' or 'discipline'. 

_Both_ of my parents, when I've recently pressed them on them openly using physical violence on their children, said "i tried other methods and they were not working".

I suggested to them:

> If I told you you disobeyed me, and then dragged you somewhere else, forced you into a bent-over position, RIPPED YOUR PANTS DOWN, and then hit you, I would be correctly charged with sexual assault. If I didn't rip your pants off first but simply hit your butt repeatedly, that would _simply_ be assault. Can you tell that it certainly wouldn't be _loving_?

My dad makes jokes about beating children. I had to contact him recently to make sure that the next time he found himself in Eden's presence, he refrained from making those jokes or threats, and I wanted him to know that he _absolutely_ was not 'allowed' to 'spank' Eden.

His response wasn't "Oh my god I would never physically assault a child", it was "oh, God says it is PARENTS who are supposed to beat children, not grandparents, so rest assured i wont hit her."

--------------------

I have broad notes floating around on why spanking is abuse. I could quote James Dobson's books if I wanted to, but I don't need to. Here's how spanking works in evangelical circles:

First, if your kid does something that you think justifies you hitting them, you're not supposed to just reach out and hit them in the moment. You need to ritualize it a bit. Take them somewhere else. Show them you're calm, and doing this out of a place of reason and love. Shame them for a bit, then make them disrobe, or walk over to you and bend over. (Do they do this willingly, or do you force it on them? Oh, the nuances of child abuse!) Then you hit them, you're not supposed to use your hand, that might cause them to flinch away from your hand in public. Maybe a spoon? It might not leave as many marks as something that would lacerate or bruise. Anyway, hit them until you feel better, or anything at all, and then (here's the kicker) tell them _you love them_, and that _god loves him_ and that next time if they obey god better, you might not beat them.

I recently read a few stories my om wrote that revolved around 'spanking' three year old me for the 'sin' of not doing _exactly what she commanded me to do_ in a timely manner. (my third birthday, I didn't put a train set away. So she beat me, and blamed god. I wish I were kidding.)

The issue wasn't even that I didn't put the train set away, the issue was I didn't _comply_ with her. She viewed her 'authority' over me as an extension of her fantasy of how God control her, or how God controls a husband who controls her. Regardless, that whole chain of control is diminished if she doesn't get the same level of control over the kids in her charge. 

So, because the bible says 'the wages of sin is death', christians think 'as long as I don't kill someone, I can hurt them all I ~want~ deem necessary to ensure compliance'. 

----------------------

No bad thing in the world is improved by additional bad things. 'retributive justice' is propaganda justifying all sorts of vindictive violence.

I will never beat eden, because I don't view our relationship as one where I am entitled to control her behavior. I seek her wellness, eagerly, and view myself as someone who can help her accomplish and do whatever she wants to accomplish and do, because I have different skills and capacities than she does. 

When things _have_ to happen, that she doesn't like, it's justifiably upsetting, and I ride through the grief with her. Tons of things happen all the time that are bad, that negatively affect us. There's genocide happening in the world, there are dangerous streets and loud engines and a coercive school system's demands to comply and limitations and lack. All of these things are worth railing against. 

I will never see intentionally terrorizing her as a 'useful tool' to coercively extract compliance from her. 

Would you believe that we have an extremely peaceful way of being, and interactwith mutuality, consideration? I am considerate towards her, but she is also very considerate to me. In ways that my parents would never be able to witness or appreciate, because they so willingly polute the intimate space of a relationship with coercion and violence. 

no problem solving is achievable if one of the parties knows the other one will hurt them if they become suitably displeased. 

This is abuse.

## Oops, I've "spanked" (abused) a child of mine in the past

what to do?

OK, so, starting point is... my goal isn't necessarily to be gentle with _your_ ego. A fair approach is to first attend to the experience of the victims. Lets first concede the power of language. it's not 'spanking' it's 'hitting and then creating intellectual or moral justification'. 

Never utter 'spanking' seriously again. It's now 'hitting children', and 'speaking falsehoods about who is doing what to whom'. 

My mother, for example, would say things like: "Spanking you hurts me more than it hurts you", and "You deserve this beating because of what you did." Enough of me believed me, for a time. By the time I was older, I knew something was very wrong with how I was being treated, but still fawned my way through my teenage years. Hilariously, my parents labeled me as 'rebellious', because I sometimes verbally advocated for myself, or used my intellect to push back against theirs.

Because it was never about intellect or correctness, it was always about power dynamics, I would be _ruthlessly_ bowled over, intellectually or emotionally, by my bully of a male parent and my manipulative/dissociated female parent. 

When I encounter 'forgiveness' energies, from others, I think "Do you _always_ suggest to victims of abuse that they forgive and forget their abusers? I hope no one being mistreated by anyone ever finds themselves in a position to rely on you in times of need, your response is so inadequate."

I am interested in not being complicit with abusers, and so many of the people I've spoken to about this (well, not so many, but too many) of the people _are painting themselves as complicit in child abuse or child sexual assault_. 

So:

> Hi, [child], there were times in the past that I thought it was okay to use my size and role to hurt you, either with my hands or extensions of my hands. I convinced myself that it was appropriate for me to overpower you in in these ways, to force you to experience me as overwhelming, terrifying, hurtful. That alone is pretty bad, but then I also further assaulted your sense of self, by trying to convince you that all the rage and hurt you felt at how I treated you was innapropriate, because I tried to convince you that this mistreatment of you was _love_. 
>
> It is, in fact, hateful to intentionally hurt someone, for any reason, even in response to a 'perceived wrong'

## But they sinned!

I'll tell you what I told Eden, when she was quoting me things she hears at 'camp' (a school run by a 'lutheran church')

She says "God keeps us safe", and I tell her "well, really, _you_ keep yourself safe. And people around you. But mostly you."

It's not "thank god for keeping me safe" it's "thank Eden for keeping Eden safe". (She's attentive with her movements, her bike, roads. She is, literally, very responsible for her own safety. I obviously stay nearby when she's with me, I work with effort to maintain her safety too)

but then she said "jesus fixed my sins" or something like that.

I said "Eden, did you know there are some people who think someone like you is _fundamentally bad?_ How could that be? Isn't that sad? You're delightful in every way. There's nothing wrong with you, there's only so many things that are interesting and distinctive and fun and cool about you. None of them are bad. So funny, that some people try to convince other people that everyone is bad and needs to do things about it."

She says "God is so big" and I say "Yep. So is that vehicle. it's sooo big! And look at that tree, and that mountain. wow. so much is so big." 

So, I fundamentally _vomit from my mouth_ the concept of sin. If you're coming at me about someone elses sin, I'm just clocking you as a perpetrator or victim (or both) of settler colonialism and the intellectual self-justifications they spun around themselves. 

It goes like this:

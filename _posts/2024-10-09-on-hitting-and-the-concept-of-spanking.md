I've recently been engaging with people who have built into their sense of self the "rightness" of adults hitting children, while at the same time rejecting the possible rightness of children hitting adults. 

This was brought into _hilarious_ and tragic relief for me recently.

For some context setting, my parents read and embodied the ideologies of a man (of course) named James Dobson, who was a eugenicist, and taught that parents, if they suitably controlled the behaviors and thoughts of their children, could 'raise' them to be good members of a civil society. (European american settler colonialism). 

Settler colonialists use ethnic cleansing as a primary tool for accomplishing their goals, because it works pretty well,_obviously_. 

So, the kinds of people that would support population confinement and displacement and genocide, on the concept of 'race', make for interesting parents. Settler colonialists use violence and coercion to get what they want. Violence is expensive and risky, so sometimes other, 'gentler' forms of coercion can be made effective. Economic coercion, for instance, might seem gentler than knocking someone's house over with a bulldozer, but it's all on the same spectrum.

The bulldozer shows up only if the other methods are deemed to have failed.

This is the core, fundamental dangerous attitude of all people who concede the correctness of the concept of 'spanking', but really the concept of 'punishment' or 'discipline'. 

_Both_ of my parents, when I've recently pressed them on them openly using physical violence on their children, said "i tried other methods on you when you were young, they didn't work, so we _had_ to keep turning up the pressure.".

I suggested to them:

> If I told you you disobeyed me, and then dragged you somewhere else, forced you into a bent-over position, RIPPED YOUR PANTS DOWN, and then hit you, I would be correctly charged with sexual assault. If I didn't rip your pants off first, and still hit your behind repeatedly, that would _simply_ be assault. Can you tell that it certainly wouldn't be _loving_? Would it feel loving if I used a stick instead of my hands, and tried to use a calm voice instead of displaying anger?"

My dad seems to like telling stories about beating children. I had to contact him recently to make sure that the next time he found himself in Eden's presence, he refrained from making those jokes or threats, and I wanted him to know that he _absolutely_ was not 'allowed' to 'spank' Eden.

His response wasn't "Oh my god I would never physically assault a child", it was "oh, God says it is PARENTS who are supposed to beat children, not grandparents, so rest assured i wont hit her, because that is _your_ job, to hit her."

lol. his lack of self-awareness continues to stun.

--------------------

I have broad notes floating around on why spanking is abuse. I could quote James Dobson's books if I wanted to, but I don't need to. Here's how spanking works in evangelical circles:

If your kid does something that you decide justifies you beating them, you're not supposed to just reach out and hit them in the moment. 

You are supposed to ritualize it a bit. Take them somewhere else. Show them you're calm, and doing this out of a place of reason and love. 

Shame them for a bit, then make them disrobe, or walk over to you and bend over. (Do they do this willingly, or do you force it on them? Oh, the nuances of child abuse!) 

Then as you hit them, you're not supposed to use your hand, that might cause them to flinch away from your hand in public, which would be awkward. Maybe use a spoon or a thin stick. It might not leave as many marks as something that would lacerate or bruise. Anyway, hit them until you feel better, or until you feel anything at all, and then (here's the kicker) tell them _you love them_, and that _god loves him_ and that next time if they obey god better, you might not beat them. Tell them that you're hitting them because _they made you hit them_ and that you're hitting them _for their own benefit_. 

I recently read a few stories my om wrote that revolved around 'spanking' three year old me for the 'sin' of not doing _exactly what she commanded me to do_ in a timely manner. (my third birthday, I didn't put a train set away to her liking. So she beat me, and blamed god/me for the beating. I wish I were kidding.)

The issue wasn't even that I didn't put the train set away, the issue was I didn't _comply with her demands_. She viewed her 'authority' over me as an extension of her fantasy of how God controls her, or how God controls a husband who controls her. Regardless, that whole chain of control is diminished if she doesn't get the same level of control over the kids in her charge. 

So, because the bible says 'the wages of sin is death', christians think 'as long as I don't kill someone, I can hurt them all I ~want~ deem necessary to ensure compliance'.

## The concept of punishment & discipline is definitionally abusive

*deep breath*

Discipline and punishment are inherently supremacist. Usually when someone says "discipline", they mean "punishment", and "punishment" is usually shorthand for 'retributive violence'. The theory (as it works in patriarchal/authoritative/supremacist families) is simple:

1. if a bad thing happens, someone or something is offended, completely independent of the simple effects of that bad thing. If I ask you to take out the trash, and you say no, the 'bad thing' is that the trash is still in the trash can. To a patriarchal person, that's the least of the concerns. The real concern is that the honor of the patriarch has been offended, because the property/possession of the patriarch has presumed a state of equality with the patriarch, which is the _real_ offense. So, to fix _the offended honor_ of the patriarch, a further harm needs to be obtained - pain must be extracted from the willful individual, to enforce the concept of supremacy: "There is a hierarchy here, and you damned well better understand where you sit."'[^jokes]

[^jokes]: It was said in the family in which I grew up: "I could kill you and make another one just like you." Mmm, thanks for affirming the inherent dignity of a person. I was so desirous of a modicum of affection from him that I'd pretend it was funny.

No bad thing in the world is improved by additional bad things. 'retributive justice' is propaganda justifying all sorts of cruel violence.

Yes, I am condemning the settler colonialist regime of social control some call 'the american criminal justice system'. For all the money wasted on that system, everyone could be housed and fed and given safety and security _without coercion_. Even the people who find themselves working the system as the oppressor. (Yes, I propose housing, food, dignity, even to the people currently complicit in perpetuating the evils of that system.)

## What gets unlocked if punishment and coercion are dropped

The first place one encounters punishment energy is the many admonitions "though shalt not exist <here>"

I HATE to see in America at large, and Denver, in particular, when the state spends resources to lock people out of otherwise inhabitable spaces. So, all state land would become eligible for camping/"slum" construction. I'm sad to see anyone living aside a highway, but it's obvious that they're there because it's the least-bad option. So, by default, all state highway land, underpasses, parking structures, whatever, would become eligible for people to build _permanant_ structures, and they would be places where the police would never be sent.

Most countries that don't allocate such resources to population control (the USA 'needed' to control both native people AND slave populations, so it's *really* good at population control) have 'slums', which is a pejorative term for 'unofficial housing, permenant' or 'unlicensed housing, permanent'. 

That's all. So, embrace slummy energy, and make the government policy:

> if you find yourself in need of housing and can sort it out, you can build unofficial housing and generally know you will not be disturbed, on 'public' land. A hammock around a tree is as permissable as a structure built out of wood or brick and corrugated tin. 

if it's not "pretty enough" to satisfy european american preferences, offer at _minimum_ paint, paintbrushes. giveaways from a nursury. 



This is so beyond the pale in America that to utter it already makes _most_ european american people look at me crosseyed. I'd love to point them towards regimes where _all_ building construction is unlicensed, but not without norms, and works perfectly adequately, with many less harms than the american system. 

Next, supplies of clean water and at least one meal a day would be provided wherever makes sense to get to those people. The deputized slave patrols sometimes called 'police' would be banned from existing in/around those spaces. Boom. Insta-secure. Clean water could be just a spigot run from a city supply via underground pipe, to the place where the encampment exists. 

The one-free-meal would be something like a catering service that drops off a hot lunch to a covered, shaded structure, somewhere in the vicinity. Companies around the world use this service every day to feed groups of employees when they don't have in-house cooking, which is (shocker) most companies. To act like this is not a commonly done act is insane. One meal a day, plus people taking some left overs for a dinner or whatever, completely eliminates hunger.

I dislike portapotties and septic systems, but obviously humanure needs to be dealt with. Wherever there are people, I say drop off the following supplies, and let the people sort it out:

1. The book [the humanure handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Humanure-Handbook-Guide-Composting-Manure/dp/0964425831)
2. at least 4-8 pallets
3. a few bales of hay
4. a bunch of 5 gallon buckets
5. a few cubic yards of sawdust (dumped on the ground, it can/should be allowed to get wet/weathered)

those supplies will let someone set up a lovely humanure composting system, without need for connection to city sewers or portapotties. As long as there is a water supply, and one can rinse out the buckets as they use them, now, everyone can have a bathroom wherever they want. 



I will never beat eden, because I don't view our relationship as one where I am entitled to control her behavior. I seek her wellness, eagerly, and view myself as someone who can help her accomplish and do whatever she wants to accomplish and do, because I have different skills and capacities than she does. She communicates with me in a straightforward, reasonable way, because she hasn't had to learn the art of manipulating adults to try to get love and kindness from them. 

When things _have_ to happen, that she doesn't like, it's justifiably upsetting, and I ride through the grief with her. Tons of things happen all the time that are bad, that negatively affect us. There's genocide happening in the world, there are dangerous streets and loud engines and a coercive school system's demands to comply and limitations and lack. All of these things are worth railing against. 

I will never see intentionally terrorizing her as a 'useful tool' to coercively extract compliance from her. 

Would you believe that we have an extremely peaceful way of being, and interactwith mutuality, consideration? I am considerate towards her, but she is also very considerate to me. In ways that my parents would never be able to witness or appreciate, because they so willingly polute the intimate space of a relationship with coercion and violence. 

no problem solving is achievable if one of the parties knows the other one will hurt them if they become suitably displeased. 

This is abuse.

## Oops, I've "spanked" (abused) a child of mine in the past

what to do?

OK, so, starting point is... my goal isn't necessarily to be gentle with _your_ ego. A fair approach is to first attend to the experience of the victims. Lets first concede the power of language. it's not 'spanking' it's 'hitting and then creating intellectual or moral justification'. 

Never utter 'spanking' seriously again. It's now 'hitting children', and 'speaking falsehoods about who is doing what to whom'. 

My mother, for example, would say things like: "Spanking you hurts me more than it hurts you", and "You deserve this beating because of what you did." Enough of me believed me, for a time. By the time I was older, I knew something was very wrong with how I was being treated, but still fawned my way through my teenage years. Hilariously, my parents labeled me as 'rebellious', because I sometimes verbally advocated for myself, or used my intellect to push back against theirs.

Because it was never about intellect or correctness, it was always about power dynamics, I would be _ruthlessly_ bowled over, intellectually or emotionally, by my bully of a male parent and my manipulative/dissociated female parent. 

When I encounter 'forgiveness' energies, from others, I think "Do you _always_ suggest to victims of abuse that they forgive and forget their abusers? I hope no one being mistreated by anyone ever finds themselves in a position to rely on you in times of need, your response is so inadequate."

I am interested in not being complicit with abusers, and so many of the people I've spoken to about this (well, not so many, but too many) of the people _are painting themselves as complicit in child abuse or child sexual assault_. 

So:

> Hi, [child], there were times in the past that I thought it was okay to use my size and role to hurt you, either with my hands or extensions of my hands. I convinced myself that it was appropriate for me to overpower you in in these ways, to force you to experience me as overwhelming, terrifying, hurtful. That alone is pretty bad, but then I also further assaulted your sense of self, by trying to convince you that all the rage and hurt you felt at how I treated you was innapropriate, because I tried to convince you that this mistreatment of you was _love_. 
>
> It is, in fact, hateful to intentionally hurt someone, for any reason, even in response to a 'perceived wrong'

## But they sinned!

I'll tell you what I told Eden, when she was quoting me things she hears at 'camp' (a school run by a 'lutheran church')

She says "God keeps us safe", and I tell her "well, really, _you_ keep yourself safe. And people around you. But mostly you."

It's not "thank god for keeping me safe" it's "thank Eden for keeping Eden safe". (She's attentive with her movements, her bike, roads. She is, literally, very responsible for her own safety. I obviously stay nearby when she's with me, I work with effort to maintain her safety too)

but then she said "jesus fixed my sins" or something like that.

I said "Eden, did you know there are some people who think someone like you is _fundamentally bad?_ How could that be? Isn't that sad? You're delightful in every way. There's nothing wrong with you, there's only so many things that are interesting and distinctive and fun and cool about you. None of them are bad. So funny, that some people try to convince other people that everyone is bad and needs to do things about it."

She says "God is so big" and I say "Yep. So is that vehicle. it's sooo big! And look at that tree, and that mountain. wow. so much is so big." 

So, I fundamentally _vomit from my mouth_ the concept of sin. If you're coming at me about someone elses sin, I'm just clocking you as a perpetrator or victim (or both) of settler colonialism and the intellectual self-justifications they spun around themselves.

this has been hard for me to write, has been sitting in one draft form or another for months. It gets ranty, at times, I suggest you skim.

If you have ever hit your children and then told them they deserved it, _i feel contempt for you_ and it's hard for me to contain that, so I'm not gonna try. I feel more an obligation to your kids, the victims of your assaults, than I feel any obligation to be gentle to your ego. As my parents told me, "there were books [written by eugenicists]

I'll get the hard parts out on the table up front. Free-associating through some of the interconnected issues:

1. Within evangelicalism, the concept of "parents spanking children" is held up as one of the core tenants of participation with evangelicalism. Indeed, if a parent does NOT beat their child, or threaten their child with physical and sexual assault, some others in the group will shame that parent. (to those people:ðŸ–•)
2. "spanking" is a dogwhistle term for adults, usually parents, physically assaulting their own children for instances of the child _displaying a will_. If a child says "no" to a parent, that is considered grounds for physical and sexual assault.
3. Spanking is CHILD SEXUAL ASSAULT. [^strong-language]

[^strong-language]: it's uncomfortable to even say this, because of how strongly some people I'm thinking would receive this. Me saying "Spanking is child sexual assault." is correctly heard as me saying "I asses _you_ as sexually assaulting your own child every time you spank(ed) them". To hear them try to weasle out. "oh, it was just a few swats on the butt", or "we only spanked you sometimes" or "we stopped spanking you once you grew up to a certain age". (Obviusly you stopped physically assaulting me as I aged. If you did it as an adult, when I could have defended myself, you might get got, and that wouldn't work so well, huh?) Evangelicals are brave about physical assault of children, but are less comfortable with the idea of assaulting someone who can defend themselves. I keep saying 'the morality of this situation is crystal clear if anyone else gets switched into these positions". 



4. I do not even pretend to evaluate as safe the kinds of people that think spanking "their" kids is fine, I view this attitude as deeply problematic. My main hope is that your kids survive you, as a caretaker. 
5. Not only is physically assaulting a child abuse, but acting like 'punishment' is a valid thing that an adult can appropriately do to a child or another adult is _inherently abusive_. 

this is all hard for me, as it puts me on the wrong side of a lot of people. My immediate family all is full of physically abusive people. The family I was married into, ditto. Same with the extended family I was born into. And because all these people also believe that _punishment_ is valid, the emotional distance grows all the more. 

So, I'm going to take a few turns at shitting on evangelicalism, because it deserves it, and it's mountain of victims deserve it, AND I'm going to shit on american-ness, and "The West", because all of these concepts hinge on the concept of 'obedience', and that if someone doesn't 'obey', they 'should' be 'punished'. [^ethnic-cleansing]

[^ethnic-cleansing]: most society-wide regimes of punishment are 'just' to accomplish regimes of social control and ethnic cleansing. European American supremacists showed up on Turtle Island in the 1600s and used the printing press + mass delusions of 'political authority' to justify their regimes of military violence, economic violence, against literally every people group existing in Turtle Island when they got there. They of course also enslaved populations of people from Africa, and needed a bunch more 'laws' to justify the enslavement regimes. The first american police departments were created by giving badges to the _existing slave patrols_

This language is all minimizing what really happens, which is:

> If you do something I don't like, I or someone acting on my behalf will hurt you, torture you, coerce you into doing whatever it is I wanted you to do. And I'll say it's an expression of love. 

Critically, _there are alternatives to punishment_ and your only hope of existing non-abusively with children in your life is if you _and they_ know that you do not see "punishment" as part of your problem solving toolkit. 

I continue to be unsure how to channel my own anger over this. I am _livid_ at Miriam and Donald Thompson, the people who contributed to my physical and emotional existance, for many reasons, and I have no intent or desire of ever 'forgiving' them. They both physically, sexually, emotionally abused and neglected me, and had abundent opportunities to do better, or differently, at any moment in their lives.

Not only could they have refrained from beating me as, like, a three year old, but they displayed courdice and head-in-the-sand isolation, when I brought these issues up, they alternated between ignoring me, or saying _I_ was the problem, and then we've currently settled on them blocking me in whatsapp. 

I'll possibly still email them a link to this blog post. I told them both, basically, "You deserve the peace that you think an abuser of children deserves." and "I'm honoring both of you by using the abundant experiences you've both provided to me, then and now, to warn others of some things."

It seems worth mentioning that the level of emotional dissociation required to beat someone else into submission is profound, and correlates with an overall inability to ever form an emotional connection. I never-not-once had a good-enough relationship with my parents. my dad left the house when I was 16, and he and I never voluntarily spoke again. My mom was mad at me that the day before I went to college I was spending time with my girlfriend ("pre-marital sex, oh no!!!!") and we basically never again had a close conversation. As I play back the last 35 years of our experience, I can tell clearly that they resented me, had contempt for me, from literally my third birthday, until now. Nothing I said or did ever impacted them, they viewed me as 'a strong willed child' (more on that later) and thus viewed my will as something to be broken, and when I kept my sense of self, despite their abuse, every evidence of my distinctiveness, my willfulness, confirmed in their mind that I was "rebellious". 

ðŸ™„. 

I despise them, because there were so many times I wanted a hug, kindness, healthy maternal or paternal energies, and they shat the bed. Over and over and over. But part of the harm is that as a kid, I _knew_ what sort of attitudes were supposed to exist between parents and kids, so I kept trying to pretend we had a real relationship. Once I became an adult, it eventually became screamingly obvious no relationship existed, and I would never be friends with people like them. I wish I could prevent my own child from ever meeting them, but alas, her mother is still part of the family system, so they get to meet eden.

They got _extremely_ offended, when I told them:

> Please confirm to me that you will never hit Eden, or make jokes about hitting children in her presence. 

To make a point about the association between discipline and punishment and rules, I said "if I find that you ever hit her, after having heard this unambiguous statement to the contrary, I will arrange a meeting between us, and I will 'give' you a spanking, for your disobedience."

I think they correctly heard the obvious threat, but rather than saying "hm, I can see why spanking energy is indeed unhealthy" they blocked me on whatsapp. I don't think they'll ever try to hit Eden, and if they did, the psychological damage to her would be much less than it would be to me.

My mom hit me many times, always saying "this is because you disobeyed me, and thus God, and the wages of sin is death, so be thankful i'm only causing you a little death, instead of a big death". 

Eden knows:

> Anyone who loves someone else would never hit them, and if an adult ever hits a child, they certainly do not love that child, probably never did, and are possibly incapable of experiencing real love.

So, she knows I view my father as dangerous, and that he hits kids, and has sexually assaulted children in the past, and then lies to kids about why he does it. She knows it's insanely hurtful to be willingly tortured by someone else, so if for whatever reason one of my parents or anyone else decided to assault her, she could experience it as simple assault, and not as a perverted expression of love. 

All the way up until I was at least 31 or 32, I would have said I thought my parents loved me, even though I also knew hitting children was wildly inappropriate. I was willing to 'give them a pass', just because I wanted to believe I had a family. Oops. 

## A quick map of what I want to cover

it's easy for me to end up on tangents, but also I want to explain things well-enough. I suspect this particular post will end up turning into several posts.

Here's what I want to make sure I touch on, unordered
- [ ] reframing 'christ suffering for sins' to 'self-justifying intellectual dressings for the nobility of feudal europe, which is when it was invented'. (Anselm of Canterbury "invented" the modern motive/meme of 'substitutionary/satisfaction atonement', which is the pivot around which all of evangelicalism turns)
- [ ] I no longer view the concept of 'sin' as having any validity. No more so than 'spanking'. 
- [ ] demonstrate a coherent reframe of "suffering", transforming it from "something maybe good" to "something certainly bad and simply to be avoided"
- [ ] demonstrate that the motif of "suffering is good" is how parents dissociate from the painful experiences they are causing, directly, to their children.
- [ ] a reframe of "Jesus significance was in His death" (what evangelicals say is the central tenant of evangelicalism) to "_if_ he mattered at all, it was because of what he did and said, OBVIOUSLY. (Yes, I am accusing Christians of having absolutely nothing to do with the teachings of Jesus Christ)


Lastly, I write in the spirit of [write things now]({{ site.baseurl  }}{% link _posts/2021-10-05-write-it-now.md %}) (rather than, for instance, never). I'll also be giving a nod to the concept of 'frame control'. _todo, write https://josh.works/frame-control, which is what evangelicals/protestants do when they discuss things like 'spanking'_. 

Lets talk about 

there was perhaps a time that jesus' teachings were tightly bound to the literal concept 'do not murder'. This particular injunction, simple enough for a child to plainly understand, is still bandied about. However, any churchy institution you or I have interacted now declares the issue "complicated". They say:

"Jesus still says to not murder, but what he failed to specify was that sometimes killing someone is not murder, thus not bad. play close attention... "

circa 1100, 600 or 700 years after a man named Constantine made "christianity" the "religion of the state",  in order to keep the support of the state, "church authorities" needed to help raise armies for their nobles. Raising armies was tricky when the peasents they decided they could "pre-forgive" en-mass, the peasants who were being dragged into armies and taken off to fight a war. The peasants once could avoid the draft by saying "jesus says to not kill, and war is obviously killing, so i don't have to participate in the states wars because I am also obligated to the church". 

That was, as I said, inconvenient to those trying to raise an army, so the church did them a solid and said "hey, cannon fodder, i just said magic words that i've decided makes it cool for you to kill on someone elses behalf, have fun in the army, bye!!!!" To "make it permissible", they said they would not issue fines or punishments for murder anymore, and might even incentivize it with first dibs on loot and plunder and such. 

It's _this_ easy to go from "murder is bad" to "if it is desired by the right person (an _authority_, the pope or the king or the president), it isn't murder, or if it _is_ murder, it isn't bad, or even if it _is_ murder, and it _is_ bad, it's not as bad as not committing murder". 

Keep that in mind around this hitting/"spanking" conversation. 

Hitting is bad, we all agree, but to permit someone to utter or hold the term _spanking_, one accepts (sort of) the statement: "It isn't hitting, if the right person pre-determined that you should be hit. It magically becomes 'discipline', 'punishment', a 'spanking', and therefore, _obviously_ an acceptable or laudable thing. 

So, this isn't a diatribe just on the concept of "spanking", or "adults hitting children and then convincing the child it is an act of love". I also contend that to assume the validity of the idea of spanking is already a disaster, because this perversion already drags behind it further perversions, usually floating around the idea called 'discipline' or 'punishment'. To accept the validity of discipline or punishment, one is casting their lot in with child abusers and (literally) Nazis. It couldn't be me.

I hold rage in me, and feel indignant, that I am going to say some of what I'm about to say. I've spoken on this topic with a number of people, including those who abused me when I was a child. They said "well, nothing else was working, so we _had_ to abuse you". I wanted to scream in their face that perhaps _their obvious needful desire to assault a child ought to have been evidence enough that something was obviously already going very wrong_. 

The framing becomes clear as soon as you reverse some of the players:

> well, if my aged parents do not instantly obey me, how will I extract future obedience from them if I do not physically, emotionally, and sexually assault them to break their will?

> my wife did not give me instant and unflinching obedience, so I hit her hard a few times, until she's I can tell by the change in tone of her crying that she no longer is resisting me, then I tell her I love her. I wouldn't have to hit her if she didn't make me.

Obviously we'd say "you are a domestic abusers and intimates should be kept far away from you. You're not safe to have around vulnerable populations."

never not once have I felt inclined to hit a child, _especially my own child_, and I'd like to help you find an easier way of being than your current pro-abuse stance.

There is obviously a lot to be said about how one can foster a loving and trusting relationship with a small/young person that isn't based in violence and terrorism, but when my brain is in the mode of "writing against child abuse" I do not find it easy or pleasent to drop into a mode of answering the question of "well, if I am not going to abuse a child, how else should I engage with them?". Another blog post will perhaps talk about that. For now, go read https://takingchildrenseriously.com/ for a primer. 

-------------------

In the year of 2024, I've talked with people who have built into their sense of self the "rightness" of adults hitting children, while at the same time rejecting the possible rightness of children hitting adults. 

- part 1: The frame control baked into the language of "spanking", hitting, a few changes of circumstances that show it certainly isn't loving
- part 2: Why abusers need to coerce you into thinking that their definition of love is more important to you than _your_ definition of love, and why abusers create intellectual justifications for their abuse
- part 3: so, you were physically assulted repeatedly by people who then claimed it was love. What to do?
- part 4: So, you physically assaulted small people in your care, and further assaulted them by claiming that it was loving, they should be thankful, and you see this as problemeatic. what to do?

Might tie in themes of supremacy. I use 'supremacy', 'entitlement/obligation', 'abuse', and 'emotional immaturity + exploitable power dynamic' throughout. 

I've recently been engaging with people who have built into their sense of self the "rightness" of adults hitting children, while at the same time (theoretically) rejecting the possible rightness of children hitting adults. 

If anyone "makes" it permissable to exploit a power dynamic to cause pain to someone else, it stinks for them and the person they are hurting. It's _terrifying_ to have these sorts of people in society, because if it's okay a little bit, to them, it needs to be okay in big ways, to them. 

Settler colonialism is obviously built on the idea that it's okay to do a litte murder and violence somewhere, as long as the "benefits" are "worth more" than the costs. 

The root attitude, one that is clearly visible over and over and over again when interacting with these people, is one of _entitlement_ and _obligation_.

The man whout contributed semen to the pregnancy that led to the birth of someone we now know as "Josh" (me), his name is Donald, is _obsessed_ with the concept of authority. He perceives it to benefit him today, and its a primary organizing principle for the world around him. He is military, a doctor, and has an 'advanced degree' from the educational institution most affiliated with the southern baptists. He's obsessed with authority, believes it's real, and thinks he has TONS of it. [^authority]

[^authority]: Consider a read of the short book [The Most Dangerous Superstition](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10836816-the-most-dangerous-superstition). It goes: "The primary threat to freedom and justice is not greed, or hatred, or any of the other emotions or human flaws usually blamed for such things. Instead, it is one ubiquitous superstition which infects the minds of people of all races, religions and nationalities, which deceives decent, well-intentioned people into supporting and advocating violence and oppression. Even without making human beings one bit more wise or virtuous, removing that one superstition would remove the vast majority of injustice and suffering from the world." The book is about _authority_. Certainly do not pair it with [The Problem of Political Authority: An Examination of the Right to Coerce and the Duty to Obey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15794037-the-problem-of-political-authority)

Here's a quote from a book I'll talk about more soon:

> When black men and women of their own initiative joined evangelical churches in numbers that far surpassed white evangelicals' expectations, white evangelicals realized the irrelevance of the Old Testament model of slavery and searched for new ways to understand a master-slave relationship in which both parties belonged to the community of faithful.

That quote is given without context. it comes from a book titled _The Origins of Pro-Slavery Christianity: Black and White Evangelicals in Antebellum Virginia_. [Read other quotes from it here](https://www.goodreads.com/notes/8236315-the-origins-of-proslavery-christianity/27372191-josh-thompson?ref=abp). 

the whole book is a slow, piece by piece demonstration of how slaveholders strenuously exerted themselves to maintain not just the institution of slavery, but a sense of innocense and righteousness about it all. Some slavers claimed that an authoriety external to the slaver demanded this treatment of those they enslaved.

"a god ordered the world for slavery, I'm _just_ doing what he wants me to". 

When I found the title of this book, the first time, I _instantly_ purchased it for my kindle and began reading it. Generally, when talking about it with christian people, I get met with a fascinating look of passive non-engagement. Like, they'll willingly order their entire lives around this thing (christianity), they will _claim_ it's the most pro-freedom way of being imaginable, they'll allocate dozens and hundreds of hours of time to the regime, and then claim _they don't have time_ to read a book about it.

I think it's actually because they _clearly_ see the book, even from the title, in the _exact_ same way I did, and know that it is far too dangerous to read. To read it and appreciate it would end their way of life. 

When I read this book, I remember saying "I don't know if I'll ever attend another church again". At that point in time, holding to the premis of [Exit, Voice, and Loyalty: Responses to Decline in Firms, Organizations, and States](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/149033.Exit_Voice_and_Loyalty), I was using the "voice" option, excitedly sharing what I was learning with others around me. I'd send this book to church people, I talked about it with a pastor, I told my friends, and I remember gaining such insight from their responses.

Some of my friends heard it, appreciated it, and have largely left the church. this book wasn't the only reason, but the concepts inside of it did for them what it did for me.

I struggle to give my full reasoning for why this book is so powerful.

I might be code switching repeatedly throughout this writing. I'll exlain it through the lense of 'frame control'. Frame control is a rhetorical tactic by which someone in the conversation keeps forcing the conversation to be had through a certain frame.

> I refuse to talk to you unless you use the language of {x}

is a form of frame control. I link this piece regularly: [Frame Control](https://knowingless.com/2021/11/27/frame-control/). It's an excellent piece written by an interesting person, I think it's worth the read.

As part of something of an experiment/attempt to improve the state of things even as I expected it to not work, I became "pushy" with my parents, about decisions they made raising me that previously we never discussed. (Like their decisions to hit me until I gave them what they wanted, and to use other forms of emotional coercion, terrorism)

To the degree we never discussed things they _proudly_ did to me, they kept a sense of comfort about themselves (perhaps) when thinking/interacting with me. I didn't ever discuss what I wasn't supposed to, because I was terrified of my father during and after I lived in his house, because he would _terrorize_ me into compliance with whatever he wanted. 

I'd learned to get safety by making him feel good about himself, and ignored the parts of how he treated me that was dehumanizing, and mostly didn't have a relationship with him, though he liked to claim everything was good. (We have hardly spoken since I was 16 years old, I'm now 35). A few years ago, at the beginning of this little pro-slavery christianity journey I was on, when he started realizing fractures were growing, he said "I have not changed in the last few years, I have no idea why you're pulling away."

This ignored  that I was _telling_ him, and that the environment was littered with clues about why things had shifted. His need for plausible ignorance wasn't a good look. But, since I wasn't using one of "his" frames, he could claim to not understand it.

Miriam does this too. If you speak to her from outside one of her perferred frames, you will not be heard. She is not distrubed by not understanding, she'll just let everything slide off until it lines up with her patriarchal, slave-holding christianity view of the world. It's maddening

As I was appreciating that miriam and donald's right to comfort didn't equal my need to self-abandon, and because they are occasionally seeing/interacting with Eden, and because I wanted the relationship to be clarified. They claimed to love me, I claim they hated me, lets just bring it back up and see what shakes out. This post is part of that story, and it contains excerpts of conversations (spoken, text) I've had with them, that explains a way that some people today cling to ideas that cause incredible harm and suffering. 





I now have a toddler, *and* witness constantly the oppression and coercion and dehumanization that is pointed towards children in the USA today. At her day care, I've heard adults barking orders at groups of children, being mean, being aggressive, being dissociated from the kids. I _always_ tell Eden:

> oof, can you hear the way that adult is speaking? That's not appropriate. I hope you never experience someone speaking to you like that. That's mean, and demanding. If anyone does speak to you like that, they are being mean and cruel, and if you cannot avoid a person like this, I hope you can find a way to be safe from them. 





This reveals the existance of a concept called 'retributive violence' or 'retributive justice'. Also known as 'discipline'. 

I spend a bunch of time below talking about what sucks about dealing with people who think using violence on _you_ is a noble and good thing that you should thank them for, but I want to also speak about the alternative.

The alternative to using violence on your children is _not_ trying to do all the same stuff _without violence_, it's to adress and appreciate the root issue that makes it 'feel right' to hurt someone else. 

That root issue of 'violence feeling right' is _entitlement_. The few times I've spoken to the people who gave birth to me, and listened to them justify their own violence against me, I can hear their words _dripping_ with entitlement. I was labelled 'rebellious' in high school, and my parents cannot imagine that I perhaps disliked being controlled and disrespected, continuously. 

Evangelicals point the techniques of settler colonialism at the personalities of their own children. 

When someone is entitled, they think others are _obligated_ to give them whatever they're entitled to. 

American society is _drenched_ with entitlement and obligation. Thus, American socity

I am, broadly, addressing evangelicals. Obviously there are people who beat their children who are _not_ evangelicals, but there's something particularly insideous about the beatings that evangelical parents dispense, because along with the beatings is also heavy psychological mistreatment and coercion. 

Most concisely, the modern sense of entitlement and obligation, emobied by the treatment of parents towards "their" children, is _firmly_ rooted in the sense of entitlement and obligation that european americans exhibited towards people kidnapped from Africa and enslaved in America, _or_ who's ancestors were kidnapped from Africa.

This book utterly ended my ability to exist within evangelical circles: [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2507760.The_Origins_of_Proslavery_Christianity#](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2507760.The_Origins_of_Proslavery_Christianity)

I now view existing within or parallel to evangelicalism in silence as being complicit with supremacists. I cannot utter with my mouth the kinds of words that flowed from the pens of american evangelical slaveholders (pardon the redundancy). 

[Here are a few highlighted sections from the above book](https://www.goodreads.com/notes/8236315-the-origins-of-proslavery-christianity/27372191-josh-thompson?ref=abp)

> If the command to love one's neighbor made Lumpkin realize in 1915 that segregation was wrong, why did so few white southerners realize that race-based slavery was wrong? By all accounts, white southerners in the nineteenth century were among the most devoted Christians in the Western world, but their faith seems only to have strengthened their determination to hold another people in bondage. This book represents my attempt to understand this staggering moral failure-to understand why the parable of the Good Samaritan fell on deaf ears for so many generations.

> As long as the vast majority of slaves had "lived and died strangers to Christianity" in colonial days, keeping the occasional convert enslaved had not caused white evangelicals many scruples. When tens of thousands of people of African descent were clamoring for admission to evangelical churches following the Revolution, however, and were starting their own churches when whites were too slow or unwilling to facilitate the admission of blacks to white congregations, it became impossible for whites to maintain the illusion that religious commitment provided a meaningful distinction between them and their slaves.

> He justified slavery as one of many hierarchical relationships approved by God in a 1757 sermon, _The Duty of Masters to Their Servants_. In what would become the most important plank of the proslavery argument, he taught that *"the appointments of Providence, and the order of the world, not only admit, but require, that there should be civil distinctions among mankind; that some should rule, and some be subject; that some should be Masters, and some Servants.* [^rulers-and-subjects]

[^rulers-and-subjects]: Supremacists use this justification for their supremacy all the time. Not "I want to be dominant over you" but "someone else, long ago, wanted people like me to be dominant over people like you". My father sometimes is in the company of my child, regrettably, so I once got on the phone with him to confirm that he knew i extended him _zero_ license to ever threaten my child with hitting, or to make jokes about hitting children in her presence. He reacted with indignance, not that he wouldn't hit a child, but that only _parents_ are supposed to hit kids, not grandparents, and he had the _luxury_ of not being required by his god to beat my child. 

This was brought into _hilarious_ and tragic relief for me recently. I was about 31 before ever considering that I'd been raised by emotionally abusive people. I believed the spoken narrative, that it was 'love', and I'd accepted that there was no relationship between me and my parents. When my dad left the house when I was 16 to conduct colonialism in the middle east on behalf of the American empire, we hardly ever spoke again. That was, for the record, 19 years ago. 

It never struck me as odd that I had no relationship with my mother. Never once in my life did it cross my mind that I could obtain nurturance or emotional comfort from her, or a sense of attunement. It wasn't until I started watching other adults having nice relationships with _their_ parents that I realized something had been wrong in my own childhood.

I still couldn't place it. I noticed having a confidence that my parents hated me, but they enjoyed having me around IF I was playing the role of 'successful, subservient son', so they could take credit for it. If I stop playing that role, I'm treated with either withdrawal and shunning, or open opposition coupled with intimidation and manipulation.

For some context setting, my parents read and embodied the ideologies of a man (of course) named James Dobson, who was a eugenicist, and taught that parents, if they suitably controlled the behaviors and thoughts of their children, could 'raise' them to be good members of a civil society, defined as "participating in european american settler colonialism with a certain ideological bent."

Settler colonialists use ethnic cleansing as a primary tool for accomplishing their goals, because it works well ,_obviously_. 

So, the kinds of people that would support population confinement and displacement and genocide, on the concept of 'race', make for interesting parents. Settler colonialists use violence and coercion to get what they want. Violence is expensive and risky, so sometimes other, 'gentler' forms of coercion can be made effective. Economic coercion, for instance, might seem gentler than knocking someone's house over with a bulldozer, but it's all on the same spectrum.

The bulldozer shows up only if the other methods are deemed to have failed. Abusers say they _usually_ don't have to assault their children, but it is still all full of violence because they and their kids know that if certain compliance isn't had, the violence emerges. 

This is the core, fundamental dangerous attitude of all people who concede the correctness of the concept of 'spanking'. It's an extension of the concepts of 'punishment' and 'discipline'. 

_Both_ of my parents, when I've recently pressed them on them openly using physical violence on their children, said "i tried other methods and they were not working, so I did what I had to do."

I suggested to them:

> If I told you you disobeyed me, and then dragged you somewhere else, forced you into a bent-over position, RIPPED YOUR PANTS DOWN, and then hit you repeatedly, I would be correctly charged with sexual assault. If I didn't rip your pants off first but simply hit your butt repeatedly, that would _simply_ be assault. Can you tell that it certainly wouldn't be _loving_?


His response wasn't "I would never assault a child", it was "oh, God says it is PARENTS who are supposed to beat children, not grandparents, so rest assured i wont hit her, because that is _your_ job, to hit her."

I've written and deleted several sentences, trying to capture the depth of my disgust at everything about him and his way of being. 

--------------------

I have many notes (typed, written) floating around on why spanking is abuse. I could quote James Dobson's books if I wanted to, but I don't need to. Here's how spanking works in evangelical circles:

> If your kid does something that you decide justifies you beating them, you're not supposed to just reach out and hit them in the moment. You are supposed to ritualize it a bit. Take them somewhere else. Show them you're calm, and doing the hitting from a place of reason and love. Shame them for a bit, then make them disrobe, or walk over to you and bend over. (Do they do this willingly, or do you force it on them? Oh, the nuances of child abuse!)

> Then as you hit them, you're not supposed to use your hand, that might cause them to flinch away from your hand in public, which would be awkward. Maybe use a spoon or a thin stick. It might not leave as many marks as something that would lacerate or bruise. Anyway, hit them until you feel better, or until you feel anything at all, and then (here's the kicker) tell them _you love them_, and that _god loves them_ and that next time if they obey you/god better, you might not beat them. Tell them that you're hitting them because _they made you hit them_ and that you're hitting them _for their own benefit_. 

I recently read a few stories the woman who considers herself my mother wrote (about me) that revolved around 'spanking' three year old me for the 'sin' of not doing _exactly what she commanded me to do_ in a timely manner. (as her written notes go, on my third birthday, I didn't put a train set away to her liking. So she beat me, and blamed god/me for the beating. The next time I put the train set away, I did it, through tears, in the exact way she wanted. I wonder if this has anything to do with why I dislike to celebrate my own birthday, even 30+ years later.)

The issue for her wasn't that I didn't put the train set away. the issue was I didn't _comply with her demands_. She viewed her 'authority' over me as an extension of her fantasy of how God controls her, or how God controls a husband who controls her. Regardless, that whole chain of control is diminished if she doesn't get the same level of control over the kids in her charge. 

So, because the bible says 'the wages of sin is death', christians think 'as long as I don't kill someone, I can hurt them all I ~want~ deem necessary to ensure compliance'.

## The concepts of punishment & discipline is abusive

*deep breath*

When I talk with evangelicals today, they can tell quickly how I feel about adults assaulting children. They backpedal and say:

> yeah, that form of violence is bad, I would not endorse adults assaulting children either. Of course, adults need to _discipline_ children sometimes.

So lets talk about "discipline" and "punishment". These are propagandist terms for something better called "retributive vengeance" or "retributive violence".

Retribution is "punishment inflicted on someone as vengeance for a wrong or criminal act."

It goes like this:

> If I tell my child to do something, or to not do something, and they do not do it, or do it, unless I cause them pain and suffering, they will think it is acceptable to continue to disregard the injunction. 

So 'discipline' and 'punishment' means an adult arbitrarily increases the suffering and pain in a childs life, to try to ensure compliance later on. 

Discipline and punishment are inherently supremacist. Usually when someone says "discipline", they mean "punishment", and "punishment" is shorthand for 'retributive violence'. The theory (as it works in patriarchal/authoritative/supremacist families) is simple:

1. if a "bad" thing happens, someone or something is offended, completely independent of the simple effects of that thing. 

If I ask you to take out the trash, and you say no, the 'bad thing' is that the trash is still in the trash can. 

If I tell you to "stop walking ahead" and you keep walking ahead, an evil act is done, the honor of the noble is offended, and retributive violence must be meted out. To evangelicals, it's never actually about the wrong act, it's that a presumed authority figure (a parent, sky daddy) is displeased because the subservient person has treated the authority as an equal, and like any good noble from the middle ages, it is time to hurt someone. 

The real concern is that the honor of the patriarch has been offended, because the property/possession of the patriarch has presumed a state of equality with the patriarch. To fix the offended honor of the patriarch, a further harm needs to be obtained - pain must be extracted from the willful individual, to enforce the concept of supremacy: "There is a hierarchy here, and you damned well better understand where you sit."'[^jokes]

[^jokes]: It was said in the family in which I grew up: "I could kill you and make another one just like you." Mmm, thanks for affirming the inherent dignity of a person. I was so desirous of a modicum of affection from the man considering himself my father that I'd pretend it was funny.

'retributive justice' (revengeful violence) is propaganda justifying all sorts of the worst parts of human behavior. It underpins war, colonialism, ethnic cleansing, child abuse. 

Yes, I am condemning the settler colonialist regime of social control some call 'the american criminal justice system'. For all the money wasted on that system, everyone could be housed and fed and given safety and security _without coercion_. Even the people who find themselves working the system as the oppressor. (Yes, I propose housing, food, dignity, even to the people currently complicit in perpetuating the evils of that system. even deputized slave patrollers ('police') deserve shelter and food, because they are sentient.)

## Common objections

> But Josh, if I don't keep my children afraid of me with threats of violence, how will I force them to...

Stop. I won't dedignify myself by considering you to be an advocate for your own children if you presume your chief role in their life is to bully and abuse them. I hope your children, for their own good, realize that they might not be under your control their entire life and they might someday be able to save themselves from you.

> But Josh, it would be dangerous for my child to run into the road and get killed by a car, how will I prevent them from doing so without assaulting them?

Great fucking question. Does it matter to you that my own child has _excellent_ road safety awareness, and I've never threatened her with anything?

In America, traffic violence is accepted by many levels of society. I keep my kid safe in the road without ever blaming her for the potential violence she might experience. I tell her "in this country, most people drive very dangerously and would murder you without hesitation.". The greatest source of fear I feel for her is that in this abomination of a country, 40,000 people die every year on roads, and globablly, it's like 1.2 million people die. She is intimidated by roads, as I am also intimidated by roads. 

My dad, when I pressed him on assaulting me as a child, used the classic evasion "if the stove is hot and can hurt a child, who reaches for the stove, to keep them safe, I would have to punish them for reaching for a stove". 

This is the cry of a person who has no imagination. If I want to teach Eden about heat, I give her things to put in the frying pan to see how heat works. I help her hold her hand near it to test for how hot it is. I see if I can touch it for a split second to feel the heat, and let her do the same. I scaffold her skills so she can learn to accomplish whatever it is she wants, with the skills to do so safely.

It's ludicrously easy to navigate the world with a child without violence. It boggles my mind how invested parents are in reigning down violence and terror on their kids. I also happen to remember clearly how it felt to be terrorized by my parents, and the many ways I rejected every aspect of their need for control over me, and continue to reject every authority that meets me with an energy of "I believe I am entitled to coerce you, and you're obligated to obey me". 

If you want to get along with your kids, read and internalize some messages about the fantasy of authority, then share these with your kids:

- [The Most Dangerous Superstition](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10836816-the-most-dangerous-superstition)
- [The Problem of Political Authority: An Examination of the Right to Coerce and the Obligation To Obey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15794037-the-problem-of-political-authority?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=DrpkRVYchM&rank=1)
- [The Verbally Abusive Relationship: How to Recognize it and How to Respond](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/402366.The_Verbally_Abusive_Relationship?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_20)

> gee, josh, I'm not interested or willing to read books that might help me not abuse my child, or help me stand as an advocate for other children who are being abused by adults.

get the fuck off my website then. Close the tab. Never come back.

It's difficult to express the contempt I feel for this kind of thinking. Read the book(s), or at least recognize that your resistance to reading the books is rooted in the same part of your soul that wants to abuse children. You could reject that part of you, even as you extend a gracious acceptence to the rest of the parts of you that do not want to abuse children. 

If you are your own child's first abuser, and habituate them to think it is love, you are crippling them, destroying their ability to navigate the world safely, because abusive people and institutions abound, hungry for more bodies to consume. 

Which kid do you think will be safer around other kids and adults?

1. The child who is occasionally humiliated and assaulted by a parent hitting them, who then tells them it is an act of love?
2. The child who is told, in complete seriousness and confidence: "It is never acceptable for an adult to hit you, ever, and if anyone tries to do this to you, I hope you can evade, escape, or resist, and if you are able to communicate it to me, I'll expend every resource I have to protect you from that adult."

And an adult who no longer hits the kid, but still controls and coerces them with emotional and verbal assaults, is no better than one who hits children. An adult who coerces and threatens a child is fundamentally unsafe. An adult who coerces and threatens another adult is fundamentally unsafe. An adult 

To the kids of parents who assaulted them: 

Good god, how distressing it is to have been terrorized by someone who then also convinced you that they loved you. It really causes the brain to break, and the psyche to attack itself (in some ways) and to dissociate from reality (in some ways) and to project/displace shame and anger towards oneself or others. 

It's virtually guaranteed you have something like "Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder". Please do not waste your time reading _The Body Keeps the Score_, instead read Pete Walker's books [Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20556323-complex-ptsd) and [The Tao of Fully Feeling](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1136530.The_Tao_of_Fully_Feeling)

## What gets unlocked if punishment and coercion are dropped

Parents who believe children exist to serve their ego and obey them issue admonitions to children nearly continuously. The entire tone of the relationship is dominated by the parental willingness to inflict violence. The parent is unable to "see" the child. 



The first place one encounters punishment energy is the many admonitions "though shalt not exist <here>"

I HATE to see in America at large, and Denver, in particular, when the state spends resources to lock people out of otherwise inhabitable spaces. So, all state land would become eligible for camping/"slum" construction. I'm sad to see anyone living aside a highway, but it's obvious that they're there because it's the least-bad option. So, by default, all state highway land, underpasses, parking structures, whatever, would become eligible for people to build _permanant_ structures, and they would be places where the police would never be sent.

Most countries that don't allocate such resources to population control (the USA 'needed' to control both native people AND slave populations, so it's *really* good at population control) have 'slums', which is a pejorative term for 'unofficial housing, permenant' or 'unlicensed housing, permanent'. 

That's all. So, embrace slummy energy, and make the government policy:

> if you find yourself in need of housing and can sort it out, you can build unofficial housing and generally know you will not be disturbed, on 'public' land. A hammock around a tree is as permissable as a structure built out of wood or brick and corrugated tin. 

if it's not "pretty enough" to satisfy european american preferences, offer at _minimum_ paint, paintbrushes. giveaways from a nursury. 



This is so beyond the pale in America that to utter it already makes _most_ european american people look at me crosseyed. I'd love to point them towards regimes where _all_ building construction is unlicensed, but not without norms, and works perfectly adequately, with many less harms than the american system. 

Next, supplies of clean water and at least one meal a day would be provided wherever makes sense to get to those people. The deputized slave patrols sometimes called 'police' would be banned from existing in/around those spaces. Boom. Insta-secure. Clean water could be just a spigot run from a city supply via underground pipe, to the place where the encampment exists. 

The one-free-meal would be something like a catering service that drops off a hot lunch to a covered, shaded structure, somewhere in the vicinity. Companies around the world use this service every day to feed groups of employees when they don't have in-house cooking, which is (shocker) most companies. To act like this is not a commonly done act is insane. One meal a day, plus people taking some left overs for a dinner or whatever, completely eliminates hunger.

I dislike portapotties and septic systems, but obviously humanure needs to be dealt with. Wherever there are people, I say drop off the following supplies, and let the people sort it out:

1. The book [the humanure handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Humanure-Handbook-Guide-Composting-Manure/dp/0964425831)
2. at least 4-8 pallets
3. a few bales of hay
4. a bunch of 5 gallon buckets
5. a few cubic yards of sawdust (dumped on the ground, it can/should be allowed to get wet/weathered)

those supplies will let someone set up a lovely humanure composting system, without need for connection to city sewers or portapotties. As long as there is a water supply, and one can rinse out the buckets as they use them, now, everyone can have a bathroom wherever they want. 



I will never beat eden, because I don't view our relationship as one where I am entitled to control her behavior. I seek her wellness, eagerly, and view myself as someone who can help her accomplish and do whatever she wants to accomplish and do, because I have different skills and capacities than she does. She communicates with me in a straightforward, reasonable way, because she hasn't had to learn the art of manipulating adults to try to get love and kindness from them. 

When things _have_ to happen, that she doesn't like, it's justifiably upsetting, and I ride through the grief with her. Tons of things happen all the time that are bad, that negatively affect us. There's genocide happening in the world, there are dangerous streets and loud engines and a coercive school system's demands to comply and limitations and lack. All of these things are worth railing against. 

I will never see intentionally terrorizing her as a 'useful tool' to coercively extract compliance from her. 

Would you believe that we have an extremely peaceful way of being, and interactwith mutuality, consideration? I am considerate towards her, but she is also very considerate to me. In ways that my parents would never be able to witness or appreciate, because they so willingly polute the intimate space of a relationship with coercion and violence. 

no problem solving is achievable if one of the parties knows the other one will hurt them if they become suitably displeased. 

This is abuse. 

--------------------------

## Oops, I've "spanked" (abused) a child of mine in the past

what to do?

OK, so, starting point is... my goal isn't necessarily to be gentle with _your_ ego. A fair approach is to first attend to the experience of the victims. Lets first concede the power of language. it's not 'spanking' it's 'hitting and then creating intellectual or moral justification'. 

The impulse to hit is tightly linked to settler colonialism, so the repair of myth of the correctness of spanking is closely linked to walking out of a supremacy culture.

For starters, never utter 'spanking' seriously again. Use 'adults hitting children and then self-justifying'. 

I am interested in not being complicit with people who abuse children or anyone else.

So:

> Hi, [child], there were times in the past that I thought it was okay to use my size and role in your life to hurt and scare you, either with my hands or extensions of my hands, _and_ my words and tone and emotions. I convinced myself that it was appropriate for me to overpower you in in these ways, to force you to experience me as overwhelming, terrifying, hurtful. That alone is pretty bad, but then I also further assaulted your sense of self, by trying to convince you that all the rage and hurt you felt at how I treated you was innapropriate, because I tried to convince you that this mistreatment of you was _love_. 
>
> It is, in fact, hateful to intentionally hurt someone, for any reason, even in response to a 'perceived wrong'. 
>
> As a starting point, I am practicing the concept of [taking children seriously](https://takingchildrenseriously.com/), and am trying to bring mutuality and co-creation into my way of being. I cannot fully insulate us from capitalism, and supremacy, and patriarchy, which means we sometimes have to work, or I am sometimes unavailable to spend time with you, or we cannot have and do the things we want to have and do, but I will no longer make threats to extract compliance from you. 
>
> Things might be strange around here as we adjust to this new state of affairs, I'm pleased for newness. 

## On "Sin"

Usually evangelical parents won't say "i beat my child whenever I feel like it" they'll say "when {child} _sins_, I must discipline them". 

So strange, to believe in sin, now. There's bad things that people do, to themselves, each other, or to non-people (concentrated agricultureal feeding operations jump to mind), and those things need to be addressed, but the concept of sin isn't needed to fix those harms.

I'll tell you what I told Eden, when she was quoting me things she hears at 'camp' (a school run by a 'lutheran church')

She says "God keeps us safe", and I tell her "well, really, _you_ keep yourself safe. And people around you. But mostly you."

It's not "thank god for keeping me safe" it's "thank Eden for keeping Eden safe". (She's attentive with her movements, her bike, roads. She is, literally, very responsible for her own safety. I obviously stay nearby when she's with me, I work with effort to maintain her safety too)

but then she said "jesus fixed my sins" or something like that.

I said "Eden, did you know there are some people who think someone like you is _fundamentally bad?_ How could that be? Isn't that sad? You're delightful in every way. There's nothing wrong with you, there's only so many things that are interesting and distinctive and fun and cool about you. None of them are bad. So funny, that some people try to convince other people that everyone is bad and needs to do things about it."

She says "God is so big" and I say "Yep. So is that vehicle. it's sooo big! And look at that tree, and that mountain. wow. so much is so big." 

So, I fundamentally _vomit from my mouth_ the concept of sin. If you're coming at me about someone elses sin, I'm just clocking you as a perpetrator or victim (or both) of settler colonialism and the intellectual self-justifications they spun around themselves. 


## Additional Reading/Resources

- [The Politics of Jesus](https://josh.works/the-politics-of-jesus-notes-quotes) If you want to keep the person of Jesus central in your life, _and_ you want to move away from european american supremacy, the ideas in this book are a good place to start. If, along the way, you end up also dropping the person of Jesus from your life as a central organizing principle, this book is _still_ a good place to start.
- [The Origins of Pro-Slavery Christianity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2507760.The_Origins_of_Proslavery_Christianity#) This book points to the origins of 'paternalism', which is the underlying intellectual support for the sense of 'duty' some adults feel around hitting children, and the obligation they think their kids have to receive their physical abuse without protest. It started as the 'duty' masters had towards their slaves to be 'good masters', and the obligation they felt their slaves had towards them to be 'good slaves'. [here's some of my highlights from the book](https://www.goodreads.com/notes/8236315-the-origins-of-proslavery-christianity/27372191-josh-thompson?ref=abp)
- [They Were Her Property: White Women as Slave Owners in the American South](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43803602-they-were-her-property) This book is relevant to the concept of 'discipline', because it's _full_ of accounts of white female slaveowners 'disciplining' the slaves around them, or showing shocking degrees of entitlement to the very personhood of someone else. That these people _wouldn't_ beat and abuse their own children defies reason. [here's some highlights of mine](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43803602-they-were-her-property)

In reading this book, one's imagination for problem:solution relationships might be increased, after reading about legal systems far beyond what is normalized within the USA. my stance on violence is that not only is it inherently abusive, it's also unbelievably lacking in imagination, compared to creation

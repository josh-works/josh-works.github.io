I recently got access to a delightful amenity, based on where I live. I've been sharing it with others as quickly as possible, because they too have access to it. 

From here on out, when I reference "botanic gardens" or "the gardens", I'm referencing the Denver Botanic Gardens, next to Cheesman park.

The purchases are for a year, so it works out to $100/year. Botanic gardens as a thing have colonialist origins, so there's some total downsides to these particular gardens and what they represent. Also, they were built on a mass grave, and have generally been reserved as a privilege for economic elites. If you end up getting a key fob let me know and we'll go on a walk and I'll rant more about it _then_.  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

I'm happy to get this great tool/amenity into the hands of the everyperson in Denver. I've shared this info with others I live near, but manually cutting/pasting links via SMS isn't super efficient. Now this page serves as a reference for all.

Here's where the gate is, some spots to sit when the weather is nice/not as nice:

The lines are where I've ridden my scooter/walked while running Strava. Long story, here's a starting point: [https://joshs-mobility-data-54dab943ebba.herokuapp.com/?zoom=18&latlng=39.740677,%20-104.968804](https://joshs-mobility-data-54dab943ebba.herokuapp.com/?zoom=18&latlng=39.740677,%20-104.968804)



## How I use them

I can take about 3 minutes on my scooter to ride from where I live to where I park my scooter right next to the gate into the gardens from Cheesman. I can easily walk and often do, or bring Eden - it's far enough that a stroller or jogger is best for everyone, too far for her to walk unaided, and lots of the walking is crossing dangerous streets, unfortunately.

_but once you're close enough to the gardens, it's lovely_

In the winter, there's a 'conservatory' that stays warm and humid. In the summer, there's cool spaces. 

Lots of people walk to them, or ride their bike. It's not super accessible via car, so I reserve my strongest endorsement for this plan only if you don't plan on ever driving.

I go here by my self, with friends, with my daughter, all the time. Sometimes I bring a frisbee and toss for a few minutes outside the gardens, if I'm there with friends. I might bring a kindle and laptop and pack a lunch and buy a $1.80 espresso at a cafe and work for a bit.

I'm writing and publishing this post from the gardens, before my laptop battery dies.

# "Key Fob" Access via the Cheesman Park Gate to the Botanic Gardens

It's a two-step process to get the full experience. An online purchase, then an in-person purchase.

## Step 1: Become 'digital member' of the gardens

If you 'become a member' of the Denver Botanic Gardens:

Go to [https://www.botanicgardens.org/join-give/membership](https://www.botanicgardens.org/join-give/membership), and select/pay for the `$75 Individual Plus` membership. 

Buy online and it's $10 less, so really $65. Renewals are less.

## Step 2: In person, purchase the key fob membership upgrade

It's hard to find on the website, but go read here:

[https://www.botanicgardens.org/membership-faq#fob-faq](https://www.botanicgardens.org/membership-faq#fob-faq)

There's a service counter near the front of the gardens, tucked sort of 'behind' the Copper Door coffee shop. Go there, ask for the key fob, pay $35 for the fob, it's supposedly $15 to renew subsequent years.

You'll get a little plastic key fob. Congratulations, have a wonderful time. Most days the gardens are open 8a to 8p, and that key fob seems to open the door from Cheesman even as late as 7:45p, which I didn't expect. YMMV.


Questions? Let me know. I'll update this post as makes sense.

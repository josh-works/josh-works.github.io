<p><a href="http://joshkaufman.net/">Josh Kaufman</a> wrote an excellent book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591845556/"><em>The First 20 Hours</em></a>.
In it, he carefully plots out a handful of experiments to acquire a reasonable amount of skill in a new thing in twenty hours.</p>
<p>He studied yoga, windsurfing, programming, <a href="http://colemak.com/">Colemak</a> typing, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28game%29">a form of Chinese chess called Go</a>, and the ukulele. He spent just twenty hours on each of these subjects, and got to a reasonable level of proficiency.</p>
<p>I was inspired to try this method, and attempted to learn to type in <a href="http://colemak.com/">Colemak</a>. (It's an alternative keyboard layout). I got in a few hours of practice, got my words-per-minute to just above ten (yes. Ten words per minute) and then got distracted and gave up.</p>
<p>So - I'm going to try again, but I'm going to see how much I can accomplish in five hours of practice. These hours will certainly not be consecutive. I will practice in short intervals spread over a few days, and I'll report back my practice.</p>
<p>Before I start I'll define success, very carefully. More on that later. One of my metrics of success will be to write a 100-word post using Colemac in less than five minutes. Phew.</p>

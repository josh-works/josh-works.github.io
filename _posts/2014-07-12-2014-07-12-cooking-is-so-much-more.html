<p>I've long wanted to get better at cooking. I eat a lot of food, and would like to enjoy it. I've gotten to a point where I am comfortable following a recipe, and I bet you normally are fine following a recipe too.
To follow a recipe, you must have two things. These two things have always surprised me in their difficulty.</p>
<ol>
<li>Decide what recipe to follow</li>
<li>Have the proper ingredients on hand</li>
</ol>
<p>There's a lot of planning that goes into eating. I don't love running to the grocery store. We go once a week. This means we have to plan out what meals we will eat, in advance. If I want to eat better, <em>and </em>cook outside my comfort zone, this means we have to figure out what meals we want to eat, which hopefully uses the items we have on hand. For example, if a meal requires a tablespoon of molasses, and you don't have any, you need a whole jar of molasses. BUT! Once you have that jar, you can use it in many meals before going to the store again.</p>
<p>This grows complex when you have a bunch of partially used ingredients lying around. I'm still trying to figure out what a "core" list of ingredients and supplies we need. It's this list of background knowledge that will make cooking easier. Right now, when I see a list of fifteen required ingredients, I barely know if we have any on hand, or if we don't, if we have any substitutions. This means fifteen ingredients presents fifteen little puzzles.</p>
<p>With time, and skill, fifteen ingredients will present only two or three unfamiliar ingredients, and picking recipes will be easy. Then, grocery shopping won't be so stressful.</p>
<p>In summary - if you want to be a better cook, know your pantry better.</p>

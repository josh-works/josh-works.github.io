<p>The first thing I did when making this post is I set it to be published tomorrow.</p>
<p>Then, I left the room for a bit. I didn't have anything to say. Or, I didn't think I did.</p>
<p>Yet, all over my computer, and in various list trackers and note-taking apps, I've got dozens of ideas to write about stashed away. I've got 25 potential posts in various states of done-ness.</p>
<p>All these words, with little pressure to write, but endless reason to refine a little longer.</p>
<p>In other words, a perfect recipe for procrastination.</p>
<p>I miss the habit of the mind of writing. Once I've "cleared the deck" of past things I <em>have</em> written, I've got to come up with new things to write. Which means I need to be cognizant of ideas that pass through my head, and I need to flesh them out to something that can be expressed.</p>
<p>Heck, I don't even need to just <em>notice</em> ideas, I need to <em>have</em> ideas, and then execute on them.</p>
<p>So, here we are, a little after setting this post to be published, with nothing to say.</p>
<p>To my pleasant surprise, it seems I may have said something.</p>

<p>I'm cleaning up some notes I wanted to jot down over the last few weeks</p>

<p>Nassim Taleb, in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083DJWGO/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">Antifragile</a></em>, says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The great economist Ariel Rubinstein gets the green lumber fallacy - it requires a great deal of intellect and honesty to see things that way.
  Rubinstein refuses to claim that his knowledge of theoretical matters can be transalted - by him - into anything directly practical. To him, economics is like a fable - a fable writer is there to stimulate ideas, indirectly inspire practice perhaps, but certainly not to direct or determine practice. </p>

  <p>Theory should stay independent from practice and vice versa.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rubinstein's injunction that <em>theory should stay independent from practice</em> has two implications:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>It is easy to confuse theory <em>about</em> an outcome and the <em>practice</em> that led to that outcome. We're all guilty of building narratives around events in our lives, both good and bad. Sometimes our narratives match reality, and sometime they don't.</p>

<p>It's important to realize that it is difficult to distinguish the two. Nassim referenced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile#Green_Lumber_Fallacy">the green lumber fallacy</a> in which a very successful commodity trader <em>didn't understand what the commodity was that he was trading</em>. (The trader thought that "green lumber" was lumber painted green, when it is actually just freshly cut lumber)</p>
</li>
<li><p>When we dispense feedback, advice, or judgement, we should be acutely aware that <em>we probably don't understand events nearly as well as we think we do.</em> </p></li>
</ol>

<p>If someone asks me how to rock climb better, I'll tell them things that I think have helped me climb better. I could be entirely wrong about what matters. For example, I have tiny little legs. Barely any meat on them. I've got an ideal strength to weight ratio right off the couch. Does it really matter how much time I spend hangboarding? Sure, but probably not as much as I think it does.</p>

<p>If I never displayed an aptitude for rock climbing, I probably would not be a rock climber. The aptitude was helped along by a genetic predisposition to have small legs. I never chose this, and am barely aware of it, so my advice to others should never be blindly trusted. This goes for anything related to jobs, money, hobbies, relationships, etc. I can't imagine how many important components of each of those I'm entirely ignorant of. </p>

<p>What I say is at best a story, a fable. I want to stimulate ideas, and perhapse indirectly inspire practice, but not direct or determine anyone's decisions. </p>

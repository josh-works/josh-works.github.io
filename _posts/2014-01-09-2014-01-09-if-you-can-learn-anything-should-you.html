<h2>Talent is Overrated</h2>
<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Talent-Overrated-Separates-World-Class-Performers/dp/1591842948">Talent is Overrated</a>, the author argues that world-class performers are <em>not</em> genetically gifted. The difference between world-class performers and the rest of us? Lots of <a href="http://lifehacker.com/what-mozart-and-kobe-bryant-can-teach-us-about-delibera-1442488267">deliberate practice</a>. (Read the article.)</p>
<p>I have no interest in becoming Mozart, or Tiger Woods (oh, and that ship has sailed <em>long</em> ago) but it's not to late forÂ <em>anyone</em> to do one of two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Achieve proficiency in a current skill</li>
<li>Learn something completely new<!--more-->
</li>
</ol>
<p>Since no one attempts to master or dominate most things that they do, there is tremendous opportunity for <em>you</em> to separate yourself from your peers. Or make big improvements in something because you want to.</p>
<p>The key to either of this is learning how to apply the concept of deliberate practice to the field.</p>
<h2>The First 20 Hours</h2>
<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-First-20-Hours-Anything/dp/1591845556">The First 20 Hours</a>, the author lays out a framework for achieving proficiency in a new field in twenty hours of deliberate practice.</p>
<p>He lays out a reusable approach to any skill. Learning a skill <em>with skill</em> is extremely appealing to me. Taking the "talent is overrated" approach</p>
<p>Ten practices of rapid skills acquisition:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a lovable project</li>
<li>Focus your energy on one skill at a time</li>
<li>Define your target performance level</li>
<li>Deconstruct the skill into subskills</li>
<li>Obtain critical tools</li>
<li>Eliminate barriers to practice</li>
<li>Make dedicated time for practice</li>
<li>Create fast feedback loops</li>
<li>Practice by the clock in short bursts</li>
<li>Emphasize quality and speed</li>
</ol>
<p>He covers a lot in the book, but it is a quick read.</p>
<p>I'm eager to apply these methods to some projects soon. My first project? Programming. I've been messing around with programming for a while, but I'd like to make a small but dedicated push on it.</p>
<p>My first task is getting an environment set up on my computer where I can do the things required to create and publish anything I create, no matter how simple. It's <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">not the easiest to install</a>.</p>
<p>More soon!</p>

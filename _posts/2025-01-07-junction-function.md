## Introduction

Junctions have functions, and users. 

Here's a photo of several junctions:

here's the three "main" junctions, though there are many smaller junctions as well:

The one on the right is a "signalized" or "controlled" intersection, the other two is "unsignalized" and "uncontrolled".

Right off the bat, I can see so many things that make me sad in this picture. The obvious result of "parking minumums" mean most of the built environment is covered with asphalt, and is space very opposed to any sort of people. 

I propose these junctions can be made to function much better, more safely, and with fewer hassles and impositions and pollution. 

I also propose that these junctions         are best fixed with something like traffic cones. 

## Killed By A Traffic Engineer

The book [Killed by a Traffic Engineer: Shattering the Delusion that Science Underlies our Transportation System](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/201978334-killed-by-a-traffic-engineer) is a necessary pre-condition to what you are about to read.

You certainly do not need to read the book to appreciate what is to come, but you must not be labouring under the delusion the book references - there is nothing about "science" or "responsiveness" that underlies the American transportation system.[^mutcd]

[^mutcd]: [The Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices](https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/kno_11th_Edition.htm) is the document that undergirds literally every piece of asphalt and concrete, nearly every sign placed along a road way. It's is an entirely junk document. _YOU_ probably have not flipped through it, but if you open up that web document,

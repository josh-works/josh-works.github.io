<p> You can't, but that won't stop you and me from trying, at least a little.</p>
<p>We (Humans, americans, at least "other people like me") like to buy <em>things</em>. But we should do more than just buy <em>things</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Experiences</em> can have a much bigger impact on people’s happiness than things, and a big part of that happiness lies in looking forward to the experience that you are going to have.</p></blockquote>
<p>This article is long,<a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/114031/money-happiness-and-new-science-smarter-spending#"> but it is worth a read.</a></p>
<p>If you have $100 to spend on something, schedule something you will look forward to for a week or a month. Looking forward to something <em>is as important as enjoying the thing itself. </em></p>
<p>If you want to have 4x the fun, invite someone along. </p>

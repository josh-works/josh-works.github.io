> The more things change, the more they stay the same.

Or something like that. Sometimes change is for the better, and sometimes its for the worse. I don't know if there's always a difference.

Recently, Kristi and I have seen lots of change; I'd say its for the better, but it's not without difficulties. We've both gotten new jobs, and moved to Colorado. Each of those could take up a few thousand words a piece, but I consider it sufficient to say "things have changed".

And in other ways, things have not changed. We are part of a wonderful community that is not tied to a specific location. We have our family, and good friends. The Gospel continues to be true.

<p>I've spent months wondering about how to best blog. I've thought about schedules for releasing content, how I should decide what to write about, and whether or not I should edit my ideas before hitting the "Publish" button.
I thought so much about how to blog I never got around to blogging.</p>
<p>I've begun blogging, with this post. My target audience is currently undefined, as is the subject matter of this blog.</p>
<p>I love learning, business, climbing, my wife, books, food, and doing hard things. Cognitive psychology has a lot to offer, as does an attitude of humility. Most of what I write will touch one one of these things.</p>
<p>Expect more to come, and soon.</p>

# My first-ever time hearing the word

'tongue tie' was something I'd heard discussed (the little bit of fiber under a tongue) as the child we now know as Eden was incubating inside of Kristi's womb. I didn't think much of it then.

Cut forward to 5 days post Eden's birth, we get our first at-home lactation consultant visit, from a lactation consultat affiliated with [The Mamahood](). She was amazing. Eden was at the minimum threshold for how much weight is normal for babies to lose after being born. 

I didn't know until then that whatever weight a baby is born at, it'll lose 10% as it's diet and nutrition and metabolism cut over from 'being fed via umbilical cord from mom' to 'being ved via milk and digesting and eliminating waste'. It's fascinating, but I totally get why weight would be lost but it's not good to lose too much.

The hospital lactation consultant had checked in on Kristi and Eden and pronounced all as fine. The at-home lactation consultant said:

> I'm technically not allowed to make a formal diagnoses, but by my estimate, Eden has a severe tongue tie, and probably a lip tie, and it's interfering with her ability to generate suction, which means Kristi's milk isn't going to come in, because her body doesn't know anyone's requesting milk.

That's something of an emergency state, as you could imagine. Kristi and Eden began "triple feedings", where:

1. Eden and Kristi, nursing as usual
2. After eden would finish a defined few minutes of nursing, I'd feed her breast milk from other mothers with extra milk, obtained via friend networks and online mothers-supporting-mothers groups
3. Kristi's milk needed the stimulus of nursing to come in, so using a electric pump, she'd pump. We'd freeze it to later give to Eden.

We tracked everything to the nearest 5 or 10 ml, at the very beginning. After a weekend of this, and a weigh-in at the pediatrician's office, we could see that she was gaining weight, and we all collectively breathed a sigh of relief. It was exhausting.

I said something about the proposed tongue tie to the pediatrician, he said:

> Yeah, maybe, no biggie either way. As long as her weight is going up, all good. If not, she'll need to go on formula. We'll re-weigh her in a week.

## Extra Resources

### Bodywork from Daniel Lopez

[Daniel Lopez, DO](inspireosteopathydenver.com) very useful bodywork, bc turns out the tongue/hyoid bone/top of the spine all can be incorrectly bound together, and when the tongue is released, there's so much new movement potential. Dr. Lopez did grand work on me, from the cranium through the sternum (and even worked on a back injury that is now dramatically better, bc my head sits on my spine differently, so i don't have to compensate/over-compensate elsewhere in the spinal column)

I did my first appointment ($300) the day after my release. I kept having nearly tears in my eyese as I could feel the 'unclenching' of various portions of my body and musculature, in the days following the release.

### Nasal Breathing

A big part of a tongue tie is it's contribution to things like sleep apnea. A big part of sleep apnea is snoring. It's 'super unhealthy' to breath through the nose exlcusively, or majority, or much at all. Oops, RIP my entire childhood. Tongue ties also relate to teeth grinding, which I did, so I wore a mouth guard, which pushed my mouth open even more, so I was 100% mouth breathing when I slept, even though when awake I'm aware of how dry the air in denver is and would close my mouth.

Fixed it all with tape. A little strip of athletic tape, across the lips, and I instantly was sleeping better, waking up with the inside of my mouth feeling rested instead of dried out. 

Consider reading [Breath](by William Patel) or whatever.

<p>I've promised myself that I won't add any more books to my Kindle, either by purchasing them from Amazon, or downloading them online, or renting them from a Library.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I've let reading about doing things stand in the way of doing the things. No amount of educational literature is as good as a few days or weeks struggling with a task.</p>
<p>I'm letting myself finish what I've already got on my Kindle, though. I've got 46 unread books, so this should last me through the end of 2016.</p>
<p>Some of them are quite short (anything by Seth Godin) and others are quite long (John Keegan, First World War, Second World War). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For right now, no more book purchases or downloads. That's my rule. </p>
<p>Want to read along, or at least know what I've finished reading most recently?</p>
<p>I keep my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/27372191?shelf=read&amp;sort=date_added">Goodreads profile</a> current-ish with what I've finished reading, and at least right now, what I'm currently reading.</p>

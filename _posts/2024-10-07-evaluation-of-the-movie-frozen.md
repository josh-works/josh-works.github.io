I have a distinct way of being with kids, especially my kid, partially as a result of my own upbringing. Duh. 

I love to watch movies with her. We've watched and enjoyed primarily the movies of [Studio Ghibli](https://josh.works/recommended-reading#studio-ghibli).

We've seen _Ponyo_ many times, and enjoyed it's dignifying view of the environment, people, children, and more. 

More recently, Eden began to get socialized into American media, because (unfortunately) we happen to live in America, and kids references to Paw Patrol and movies like Frozen are _ubiquitous_, and those shows unfairly weaponize kids interests and attention spans into something that can begins _grooming_ them to be preyed upon by dangerous people later in their life, and it's despicable, and anyone involved ought to feel shame for their role in the creation of the piece of media.

> Strong words Josh, can you back that up?

Oh yes. Try to keep up.

I've got a media review of paw patrol coming up. For a preview, it's worth noting that the concept of 'policing' in america first began when supremacists in the american south printed out badges and handed them to the people who were _already providing slave patrol 'services'_, and called them 'police'. 

Regarding _Frozen_, I wrote this blog post via paper, as I watched the movie with Eden. She likes to 'process' media, usually some of the interestingness she experiences is around knowing what's coming next, so she gets a lot of enjoyment from re-watching movies. Without further adeui, here's the notes, with light editing, as I captured them across multiple re-watches of _Frozen_. 

I'll sometimes quote dialogue or a song, and add my reactions to it.

--------------------------

Anna, at the begining, showing that her entire existance revolves around getting _chosen_ by a person to become that persons... property?

> ðŸŽ¶ Maybe I'll be noticed, maybe I'll find romance? ðŸŽ¶

Both children (they are _children_ after all) experienced first emotional abuse and neglect at the hands of their parents, then the parents died, and the kids were raised by... no one? for a few years? Then Anna and Elsa just reunite in advance of a coronation ball? Is a nation really choosing a traumatized child to become their symbolic head? 

[...]

The beauty norms, so painful. sexualizes children, explicitely, as the movie starts with the depiction of these two female protagonists as children, maybe 5, and ends with them supposedly 'adult', where it becomes appropriate to see these people as sexualizable objects, but the look is the same, and there is little distinction between how a _five year old_ is being depicted, and an adult. 

the 'big, innocent doe eyes' gives helpless, shows matching the idealized male gaze of femininity. The skinny arms, impossible waists, over-exaggerated breasts, the belt that profiles hips, butt, and pubic region. Please read [Fearing The Black Body: The Racial Origins of Fat Phobia](https://www.goodreads.com/notes/43459593-fearing-the-black-body/27372191-josh-thompson?ref=abp)

[...]

> This movie normalizes emotional neglect and abuse. 

The dad (before his death) repeats over and over "suppress your emotions, conceal yourself, don't show things" to Elsa, and then _coercively destroys her and anna's memories to hide their own past from themselves". Identical to how supremacists 'cleanse' the history of their victims, to hide from the victims the extent of their own abuse. 

In _literally_ every single interaction between Elsa and Anna, for much of the movie, Elsa ends a conversation with violence. Anna keeps saying "She wont' hurt me, we're family", normalizing the idea that not only is it acceptable to overlook clear harms and mistreatment from someone because they are family, that it's in fact _good_ to end up dying as a result of their misdeeds. (Elsa attempts to murder Anna via proxy by creating a vicious snow monster that, among other things, throws Anna off of a cliff. As soon as the snow monster lept into frame, Eden's whole body stiffened up and she said "i don't like that", and we skipped the scene. In all the watchings and re-watchings of this movie, we've skipped that scene every time. 

The "we are family" admonishment is particularly painful to see, because much of the harm that people experience _is at the hands of their family members_. Parents abusing children, spouses abusing spouses, neglect all around. [^family]

[^family]: My own father, who proudly celebrates the notion of adults assaulting children, continues to think that the concept of family makes it not just appropriate, but _necessary_ for adults to sexually assault their own children. I am still working on my blog post around 'spanking', but spanking is the ritualized hitting and sexual humiliation of children, served up with a big dose of emotional abuse because the victim is told not just that _they are causing their own victimization_, but that the assault is an act of love between the adult and the child. 

    I tell Eden _regularly_ that anyone who hits children _does not love that child_ and is in fact not capable of love. I tell her that adults hit children only if the adult _wants_ to hit the child, and they sometimes tell the strangest stories to explain that away. 

    An adult who hurts a child and doesn't recoil in horror at what happened and take extensive efforts to prevent it from happening again _is not well_. I've another blog post about how the concept of 'punishment' or 'discipline'  and even 'obedience' are in themselves abusive. Stay tuned. 

Jesus, I'm three entries into this, and I'm so angry at supremacists, evangelicals, the family system in which I was raised, in which my child's mother was raised, and the long, long legacy of chattel slavery + the ethnic cleansing of the natives/nations, all by european americans. 

> _Frozen_ normalizes centering the lives of aristocracy, for no reason. It's dedignifying to children and young adults. 

This entire movie _could_ be about two people who are, in fact, not members of the nobility or aristocracy. I tell eden "believe in kings and queens and this 'ruler' stuff is a mental affliction experienced by some people who live in this country right now". 

[...]

The 'simple' townsfolk are depicted as experiencing a naive giddy joy about the castle 'opening its gates' and a party. I am not interested in watching the self-aggrandizing fantasies of the ruling class. ðŸ¤¢

The townsfolk: "It's corination day!" or "The castle gates are open!!!"

Studio Ghibli, every single one of it's movies, are infinitely more dignifying, and comprehendable to children.

I feel ANGRY that the seemingly nice person Anna meets after her first song (who also commits an act of traffic violence, running her over with his horse) actually is a con man who goes on to almost kill Anna at the end of the movie!!!!! OUT OF SPITE! I get to explain to my three year old what 'willfull betrayal' is, and why this person who _seemed_ good is in fact now being 'bad'. 

[...]

More family BS:

Frozen pushes a message:

> Family would never hurt you, family is more important than everything, thus accept mistreatment'

Frozen reinforces a colonizers mindset: No one indicates awareness of the subject class.

Anna displays helplessness, self-abandonment, needs saving because of something inherent in her femininity, not  because her key support structures hurt her and abandoned her when she was a young child. 

Cristof is written to be obsessed with who posseses her. "You got engaged???" or "She's engaged!" as the only distinctive things he can note about her. Her status vis-a-vis another male. It's _painful_ to behold the dehumanization. 

In _Frozen_, nearly every interaction between two people who presumably have penises is an interaction mediated by dominance. It is inherent to being a man, to try to dominate someone else, and if you don't dominate them, you're getting dominated. Yes, this is a movie intended for _children_. But it's also being watched by their parents. Every message this movie purports to send about the experience of being human makes the world a worse place.

[...]

Anna, upon meeting a new and novel, sentient, non-threatning being _pretends to surprise to justify kicking off its head_, anna and cristof written to be disgusted by Olaf's injured state, saying things like "eeeewwwww its head" or "eeeewwwwww it's body". When Anna puts Olaf's head back on Olaf's body, it first goes on wrong, then she flips it over, and Olaf _thanks her_.

Talk about supremacist fantasy. That's what a supremacist would love - devestate an indigenous people, then, when _slightly_ repairing the harm caused by that supremacist, they want to be earnestly thanked by the victim. 

_supremacists expect to be thanked by their victims for the abuse they meted out_. [^abusers]

[^abusers]: Don Thompson, when I pressed him about his abuse of me as a child, eventually exited the conversation with "I did what I did, you are welcome.". _LITERALLY_. Those were his words, he was trying SO HARD to make me play the role he wanted me to play - adulating child. He emotinoally kicked my head off, over and over, but because he thinks it was an expression of love, his self-concept needs me to say "thanks, don, I think you were a great parent."

_Frozen_ plays ethnic tropes regularly, as supporters of colonialsm. Non-state people as backwards, un-understandable, fractal variations of the 'magical negro' trope. 

[...]

Cristof is depicted as being seen by the trolls as an obviously superior being. #supremacy

The whol movie is obsessed with _romance_ take away romance between the protagonist and 'love interests' and there is hardly a plot move remaining. Obviously fails the betchel test. 

The entire movie is settler colonialist propaganda.

Normalizes women as property, belonging exclusively to someone else, never to themselves.

Troll song about Cristof is :vomit:, 'shipping' him and anna, without anyone's consent. When he says "BUT SHE IS SOMEONE ELSES PROPERTY, THATS WHY SHE CANNOT BE MY PROPERTY" the trolls say "Eh, that claim of property is weak, you can _totally_ own her.". Agriculturalism, state-supporting. 'true love' :vomit:

_side-note, as I'm writing this blog post a while after writing the original paper notes. got bored of the movie quickly. We would rewatch it, skipping more and more of the movie, and now when we put on Frozen we may only watch the two main songs. the opening song sung by Anna, and _Let It Go_, of course._

_Frozen_ makes white people look like royalty, or makes royalty look like white people. 

_Frozen_ depicts _impalement_ as a joke. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUUUUUUUUCK. Someone wrote a scene with Olaf getting _impaled_, indirectly, by Elsa, and it's supposed to be read as a joke, not a reference to a horrific act of violence. 

I talk with eden through these movies. Sometimes extensively. She'll initiate conversation or I will. She appreciates my help skipping the scenes she doesn't like (vicious wolves, violent snow creatures attacking others, soldiers fighting and trying to kill each other with blades and arrows)

We discuss themes of adults controlling kids, neglecting kids, coercion, support of the state, the myth of 'true love'. 

Settler colonialists suppress the sexuality they 'allow' themselves to express, and obviously suppress/exploit the sexuality of the 'other', and then do strenuous mental gymnastics to justify the whole thing. Please see [The Origins of Pro-Slavery Christianity: White and Black Evangelicals in Antebellum Virginia]()

The troll song about Cristof says "He's a bit of a fixer upper". This normalizes 'weaponized incompetence' and enmeshment and self-abandonment. I wonder which of the creators of _Frozen_ are being horrific partners to their partners, and expecting the other partner to just keep accepting bad behavior.

Cristof says 'but shes engaged to someone else', normalizing marriage, monogamy, 'possessive' love', 'true love'

_Frozen_ has incredible violence, casual malevolence, and betrayal. 

Anna is so unwise, high conflict, needlessly provocative. (Throws a snowball at the snow creature created by Elsa, after being violently thrown out of Elsa's ice palace, and the snow creature _throws her off a cliff_)

... I will write something dedicated about Suzume, the movie, soon. It's the perfect drop-in replacement for Frozen. Just watch Suzeme, never watch frozen. I watched parts of it with Eden, while she was in her _Frozen_ era, and wept with it's beauty. I'd love to do a bunch of screenshots, or snippets of scenes, to help illustrate a point. There's obviously things challenging to convey _about a musical_ through the written word, especially if you've not seen the movie(s) in question, or recently. My notes contain 'call outs' to parallel/comparing/contrasting themes between Frozen that really shows the intellectual/emotional un-self-concious poverty of the people involved with _Frozen_. 

The city-scape differences of _Frozen_ and _Paw Patrol_ and the cities/towns/landscapes of Ghibli. You, and I, would be right to anger about the built environment in the world today, and it's parallels in the landscapes of _Frozen_. Enough people in the USA have forgotten there ever was a good streetcar network in every town, so they forgot the kinds of trips and adventures and _places_ enabled by those infrastructures. 

Multiple acts of traffic violence, and car propaganda. Phrases like "Oh noooo, I just paid it off" (a sled), comments about treating it in a certain stereotypical way that mimics propaganda about cars, the fact that a sled _explodes_ after _falling off a cliff_ after _being chased by wolves_, all because this random helpless white woman threw political weight and threats of violence at someone, demanding that they head into the dangerous, cold night, causing catastrophe after catastrophe, because she felt _obligated_ to _other people's obedience_. 

[...]

"you should wait out here", she's so pushy to Olaf and Cristof and Sven, who have supported her well through difficult times, as she heads into the _demonstrably dangerous territory_ of interacting with her sister. Abandon your friends who show support of you, to receive more hurt from a family member? 

elsa _is_ dangerous, over and over, to anna. So dangerous. To rely on family binds makes all this worse.

the sexualization _of children_. Cristof says something, she makes a breathy "I like it fast!", seeming to make a nod to aggressive sex? Again, _this is horrifying_. Big breasts, the eyes, eyebrows, lips. 

Cristof, looking at elsa's ice palace, he is an ice professional, says "its so beautiful I could cry" and Anna says, derisively, "Go ahead... i won't judge". Which directly _gives judgement for the sentiment_, how did this make it into the script. 

Ghibli is full of reasonable moments of people displaying nice rapt attention to _mundane yet still beautiful_ nature, of _course_ to WITNESS AN ICE PALACE WOULD MOVE ONE TO TEARS and Disney literally attacks someone who displayed an emotional response to beauty. I wish the entire concept had been cut, OR she had given a non-abusive response to his exclamation. 

Elsa's power was just 'mishandled' by her caretakers. She obviously has tons of creative potential, it's a powerful tool, she just was shamed and attacked and tortured from a young age to think she had no power. 

She could have done useful things for her community, or made things of beauty, and ease, like parks, sculptures, slides, maybe some sort of perpetual motion machine to unburden the townspeople of some labor. 

Or cared for children, because they found her entertaining. blah blah blah, to believe that _erasing someone's memories of their own power_ is reasonable enough to model in a movie is disrespectful to children. 

Elsa creates a sentient snow monster that almost kills the other party. whole movie should be her doing cool stuff for the entire town, as an inventor/creator/artist/advocate/engineer

troll meme is offensive, based on a bunch of supremacist stereotypes about undomesticated people groups. 

Olof, about cristof: "He is crazy", jokes about taking off clothes, then being written to push agricultural marriage norms. to anna: "why are you holding back from such a man". 

In suzume, the young female protagonist travels around japan in an attempt to achieve her goals (just like elsa/anna) and has _normal_ interactions with the people she encounters along the way. 

Producer/writers trying to hide their own misdeeds? Are we seeing deep into their subconcious?

ðŸŽ¼ people do bad things when scared or tired or stressed... but throw a little love their way... [and you can maybe influence them to not harm you, themselves, or others JFC!!!]

I'll link to that song. This is _the normalization of abuse_. It could have been:

"People get stressed and tired and scared, but if they use that to justify violence or intimidation of you, you can call them at least in your own mind on the bullshit"

I skip all the overt violence, and its still so violent, prison-based, arrows, implied death, violent and intimate at the same time. In one scene anna is lying her entire body down on the person who _she just met_ and _later betrays her_, and this moment of uncomfortable closeness she experiences becomes a joke and justification for later pushy behavior. 

"true love" meme makes me hurt each time it's mentioned. so de-dignifying. 

To eden, I ask "Did that surprise you?" often enough. She will say yes or no, and sometimes why, often enough. 

It's a very rich and active experience, to watch movies with her. It's not turning a show on and tuning out of the experience. We often-enough have it going in the background, too, as other things happen, the normal movements of life. I don't put a special magical power around "watching TV", and I help her have a good, curated, enjoyable experience of the media. My own childhood was filled with this strange magical gatekeeping around screens, plus shame, plus never actually being interested in the stuff I found interesting. 

I take children seriously. Sometimes people witness it, and are _obviously stunned_ by the kinds of cool interactions they witness. I'll ask Eden _very specific, detailed questions_, they obviously think she's incapable of hearing it or giving a thoughtful response, or of offering her own spontaneous thoughts, and they're shocked sometimes. It's always entertaining. 

## Suzume notes

_OK, these are all written out on yellow legal pad, I'm gonna draft the suzume stuff here, it might get its own post later, I wrote all these notes over the last.... at least a few weeks, I really want to get it written and done_

[...] 

<insert link to wikipedia, trailer, song>

strong (like, actually strong) female lead, really a non-sexualized child. her childness is far more often a factor than her feminine-ness. 

coming of age trip, with strong built tension. there are even scenes comprable to 'violence' and 'aggression' but are not the absolute idiotic drivel that is frozen. 

Helps if you've seen/are able to appreciate studio Ghibli

creators love/understand citiues. a downstairs shop owner helps provide access to souta's apartment. Jane jacobs, this is what american-style ethnic cleansing stole from us.

Eden extremely activated sometimes by fear. Scrambles into my lap, shamelessly, and keeps watching. I check in if scared, or she wants to skip this part, she says 'no' fully credibly, so we continue. Crawls back out of my lap when the scene ends, back and forth, this goes away as she gets familiar with a movie. 

I don't like the english dubs a lot, vs. original audio + subtitles, this is the first time I've seen it with the english dubs. 

beautiful, _beautiful_ depictions of indoors and outdoors places. 

I think Eden 'processes' a movie across re-watches, and deasily departs the movie or skips it, once it's no longer interesting or novel to her, in a reasonable way. 

I value these kinds of time, even though other people criticize it. I so actively protect us from unwanted pressure, trips, rushing, restraining, limiting. I want to see her practice feeling seen as fundamentally good and trustworthy.

She will confidently and enjoyably watch something, then, when done, herself close the laptop and move on to the next thing. Sometimes we have real grieving that happens over what happens when we cannot watch something _right now_, and again, I take that grief (and the opportunity to witness it and hold her in it) seriously. 

She enjoys naming when some part is coming. it's a form of readying herself for scary parts, sometimes. I see it through a lense of helping her build inner resources to deal with the _tricks_ that adults will sometimes play in moves to get a certain response from you, with or without your permission. (jump scares, certain bits of dialogue)

# Paw Patrol

oof, more notes

statist, arrogant, high-modernist drivel. "police are helpful" the world _and nature_ desperately need A WHITE MAN TO TELL EVERYONE WHAT TO DO!!!!!

each pup has a magic packpack that has a machine, claw, gun, shovel, whatever, that because it's a machine, solves a problem.

ryder, white male, gives 100% orders for nearly every line of dialogue, is never given orders or direction, never shares/models sharing power or control. 

childlike love of military vehicles portrayed throughout, by the shows creators

v22 osprey, some ocean lander/transport thing, tanks

# bluey

season 3, episode 38, cubby.

I'm trying to articulate why I don't actually like bluey, even though so many people say it's touching. I say it normalizes patriarchy, belief in authority, abuse. 

dad: "The TV is too small, it's only 50 inches wide" OMFG, he's 'watching the game' and dissociating from the family.

agriculturalism, settled/domestication, marriage = the state, patriarchy = entitlement/obligation. 'i'll play this role, you MUST play this other role'

they're building a play/space/fort out of blankets, a cubby. 

Dad shows exaspiration, annoyence with them. dad plays obvious trope of bumbling, clueless male-figure

the fort they built is SO COOL!!!! he didnt say this once. how did he dissociate from their whole life/project? 

## next episode, 43, 'dragon'

dad diminishes mom and her skills at drawing BECAUSE SHE'S BETTER THAN HIM AT DRAWING!!!

he could have said "mom's so good at drawing, I love to see the things she draws."

Jesus fuck. it's literally abuse to hack away at someone's skills, it undermines them/their confidence/independence. this is horrifying to see. 

that does it, my notes. might get this published finally!

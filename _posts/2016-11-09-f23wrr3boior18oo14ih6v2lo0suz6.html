<h1>November 2016 Goals</h1>
<p><em>Note to the reader: The words that follow are all about me. Very naval-gaze-ish. I feel I owe you this warning.</em></p>
<p>My November goals are an extension of my <a href="https://josh.works/blog/october-2016-goals">October goals</a>.</p>
<p>October was good (<a href="https://josh.works/blog/october-2016-review">October review</a>) - I made progress on two of three projects, and one of those projects need to conclude to make space for the third. (I want to wrap up a course from <a href="http://www.climbersguide.co">www.climbersguide.co</a>, and once that hits a stable finish state, I'll switch to prep for Turing School.)</p>
<h2>Deepen my knowledge of front-end web development</h2>
<p>Same goal as last year - finish up the current tutorial, and then sketch out small next steps and start studying. <a target="_blank" href="http://exercism.io/">exercism.io</a> is a good place to work on little problems and practice a bit.</p>
<h2>Climb 5.13</h2>
<p>Last month I sent my first 5.12d outside. A few days later I sent my first 5.13a in the gym. I can do all the moves on another 5.13a, all but one move on a 13c, and almost all of them on a 13d. Due to the inflation of indoor grades compared with outdoor grades, I'm thinking the indoor 13d might be a real 5.13a in difficulty.</p>
<p>Basically, I'm breaking into solid indoor 5.13 territory, in part because I'm getting better at remembering my sequences.</p>
<p>I'm still trying to figure out what my weaknesses are, in order to train my weakness instead of my strength. I've historically enjoyed training contact strength, but I believe I'm a bit short on movement strength, and absolutely terrible with technique. So, I am trying to train my technique.</p>
<h2>Get "The Climber's Guide" rolling</h2>
<p>I'm building out an email drip campaign that concludes with a <em>hard sale </em>(after delivering amazingly valuable guides), pointing people to a sales page (er, I need to write that, too), for the course.</p>
<p>I've worked with some lead climbers in person, working through the basics of the program, and I've gotten great feedback. Things like " life changing" and "my climbing will not be the same".</p>
<p>I'm working on working with a larger group of people, and I'd like to get some video from them doing the exercises, so others can follow along on their own, but it's <em>really encouraging</em>, the kind of feedback I'm getting.</p>
<p>I'm gonna launch with just the course + video at $67, with perhaps a more expensive offer at ~$197 including lots of my dedicated time, 1:1. (I could see doing face-time sessions or something, while the climber/belayer are doing the exercises). That will be partially to take advantage of the price anchoring effect, partially because some people will know they want the high-touch version, and $200 is nothing in comparison to what they'll get in return.</p>
<h2>Misc</h2>
<p>Random self-reflections.</p>
<h3>Phone Usage</h3>
<p>I've disabled my Twitter account. I changed the password to a random string, and then <a href="http://lettertomyfutureself.net/">wrote an email to my future self</a> with the password enclosed. Delivery date is sometime in August 2017. I know I could force a password reset, but knowing the password is coming, and introducing friction to the system makes me pay way less attention to the app.</p>
<p>I deleted Instagram as well.</p>
<p>Both of these changes have helped me spend a LOT less time on my phone every day.</p>

<h3>Reading</h3>
<p>I'm building in even more reading time to my schedule every day too. It's stupid, but I sorta-accidentally set a goal of reading 100 books this year. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27372191-josh-thompson">I'm at 62 books</a> and no where close to hitting the goal of 100, (I had a three-month period where I read very little, for some reason) but I think I'm aiming to clear 75 books by end-of-year. I read about 50 last year, and plan on reading many fewer next year.</p>
<p>My effort to read 100 has made me read books that I would otherwise not have read. If it's short, and I get 30% of the way through and decide I don't want to finish, instead of stopping reading it (like I would normally do) I sometimes find myself trying to finish it. This is a bad use of time, but... oh well.</p>

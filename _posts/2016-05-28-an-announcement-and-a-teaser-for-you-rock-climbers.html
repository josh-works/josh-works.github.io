<p>Here's a clip from a video I shot today. </p>
<p>Can you guess what's coming?</p>
<p>(This is all going to happen on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.climbersguide.co/conquer-fear-course/">The Climber's Guide</a>)</p>

<p>In case you didn't guess, or you guessed wrong...<br><br>I'm shooting tons of video for a course. It's going to be awesome. It's a work-in-progress, so read along <a target="_blank" href="http://www.climbersguide.co/conquer-fear-course/">HERE</a> to follow along.</p>
<p>If you rock climb, and you ever feel anxious while leading, <em>you can resolve this anxiety completely, and unleash your inner crusher. </em>This will make both of us really happy.</p>

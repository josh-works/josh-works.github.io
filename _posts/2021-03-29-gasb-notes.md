Here's a *very* important one-hour video that is highly relevant to GASB:

If you were to watch the first ten minutes, you'd have most of the knowledge.

If you watched the first twenty minutes (at 2x speed, of course) you'll be more knowledgeable about arcane government finance machinations than 99% of the lay population of the USA. 

## Josh Thompson's Testimony

I submitted a letter (per the above presentation, which I watched live and took a lot of notes from).

Want to watch? It's surprisingly tricky, not just a public zoom room. You'll have to sign up in advance here:

If you want to get access to the presentation itself, head to https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CNJ3JD7 and check all boxes related to March 30th.

Watch the live testimony here. You might even see my funny-looking face at 12:45p: https://www.gasb.org/cs/ContentServer?c=Page&cid=1176163491510&d=&pagename=GASB%2FPage%2FGASB%2FSectionPage

## Finance-related things

Keep in mind that I'm a software developer, and only occasionally read financial statements. (That said, I do occasionally read financial statements, which I imagine is unusual for non-finance/accounting people).

I live in Golden, Colorado, and plan on living here for the next 60 years or so, until I (hopefully) die peacefully in my sleep. 

The financial well-being of my family, my children, grand-children, and neighbors is necessarily associated with the financial well-being of the City of Golden.

If you'd like to read their annual financial reports, you may find them towards the bottom of the page here:

Data-Z's gives Denver's [financial state a grade of "D"](https://www.data-z.org/state_data_and_comparisons/city/denver), summarizing the challenges as (paraphrased):

> Denver so over-spends that each taxpayer would have to be taxed an extra $5,800 to simply cover its expenses. 

## Proposed Concept Statement

Here's the [proposed statement (pdf)](https://www.gasb.org/cs/Satellite?c=Document_C&cid=1176174822546&pagename=GASB%2FDocument_C%2FDocumentPage)

On page 10, you see the following: 

> *Short-Term Financial Resources Measurement Focus and Accrual Basis of Accounting*

A former GASB board member has said:

> 

Sheila Weinberg, Founder & CEO in [Truth in Accounting](https://www.truthinaccounting.org/):

> One of the GASB members highlighted that because the governmental fund financial statements of the general fund exclude long-term obligations and related expenses, these statements “obfuscate the government’s true financial condition” and “conceal costs and obligations incurred in a current period.”
> 
> Some people have objected to the use of the word “obfuscate” suggesting it is a strong word indicating confusion and bewilderment. I think it is the CORRECT word.
> 
> It is confusing and bewildering to have a balance sheet of governmental funds that does not include the pension and OPEB liabilities even though those funds will be used to pay them. States report positive fund balances while collectively they have accumulated more than $855 billion in unfunded pension liabilities and $617 billion of retiree health care liabilities. Most of the 75 most populated cities also report positive fund balances while they have collectively accumulated more than $179 billion in unfunded pension liabilities and $160 billion of retiree health care liabilities.

## Introduction

Often when I say "scooter", especially in the united states, the person thinks of something different than what I mean. Here's Denver's [Sportique Scooters](https://www.instagram.com/sportiquescooters), here's one of their recent posts:

So _that_ is the kind of vehicle I'm talking about when I say "scooter". 

I once had a vehicle just like that. I note that I wore a different helmet, vastly safer - I always ride with a full motorcycle helmet. Head injuries are no joke. 

It's my primary vehicle, and my only vehicle. In America, nearly every situation is improved by having the option of riding one of those vehicles around.

## Collections of writings about scooters


See, it's not really about scooters, per se. It's the verb of the thing. Scooters are different than cars, but the only reason it matters at all is because scooter-ing is vastly different than car-ing. 

And some of you might say "oh, I have a bicycle, and so..."

Scootering is also different than bicycle-ing.

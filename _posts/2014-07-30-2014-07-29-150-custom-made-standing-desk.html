<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_108719"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_desk">Standing desks</a> are <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/houzz/2012/08/01/a-healthier-way-to-work-stand-up-desks/">all</a> the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5879536/how-sitting-all-day-is-damaging-your-body-and-how-you-can-counteract-it">rage</a>. (I'm still waiting for <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/03/why-every-office-should-switch-to-walking-desks/">walking desks to catch up</a>.)
</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_108733">Kristi and I outfitted our space with reclaimed furniture from Craigslist (also known as "cheap"), so we wanted to keep it going with a desk. My setup at our kitchen table was less than ideal, and we'd been wanting a desk for me for a while. We saw that <a href="http://www.ourfreakingbudget.com/150-dollar-custom-made-desk/">others have commissioned desks</a> with great success, so we gave it a shot.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_108739">A few emails and $150 later, I've got a standing desk. There are <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5919778/build-your-own-sturdy-good-looking-standing-desk-for-less-than-25">guides for building $25 standing desks,</a> but since my work station is a part of our living room, we wanted something that looked OK.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_108745">One Craigslist add later, we had a desk. We paid Drew Morris $150 for the desk, and are thrilled. (If you're in the Denver area, and want a standing desk, reach out to Drew.Morris82( )yahoo.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_108748">I've been using the desk for only half a day, so I don't have much to say, other than I really like it so far. More information to come soon!</p>

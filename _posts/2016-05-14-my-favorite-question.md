I met two people yesterday from Colorado, while in Spain. We climbed together yesterday and today, and Kristi and I had dinner with them.



Half way through the meal, I asked my all-time favorite question:


>If you could go back to twenty five year old you, and tell yourself anything, knowing it was coming from future you, what would you say? (And where were you living/what were you doing as a twenty five year old.)



I've asked this of probably a hundred people, and 
always get an interesting answer.



Want to know why I'm asking?



I'm 27. Having 100 people reflect on what they'd tell a younger version of themselves is a pretty good way to learn things.



Now, I don't recall many specific answers. Usually it segways into a larger conversation. Few people have concise, ready answers.



But if I did have a ready-made list of answers that were really insightful and a little irrelevant, I think it would look a lot like this list: 
[40 things about life I wish I could travel back in time and tell myself](https://medium.com/life-learning/40-things-about-life-i-wish-i-could-travel-back-in-time-and-tell-myself-e52f2effa3ab#.vm6s6w33h)



How about you?



If you could tell your twenty five year old self anything, what would it be? (If you're younger than twenty eight, the question changes to "if you could tell your twenty 
one year old self anything...")


## You should ask this question of those around you



This is a weighty question. Usually, when I ask someone, they say "hm. That's a good question..." and then they're quiet for a moment. They think, a lot. And their answer paves the way to great conversation, in addition to being useful in its own right.



Sometimes they thank me for the question. It's a good way to show someone that you're listening to them, and interested in them. These are good things.

A long time ago, years, I wrote a short post every day. For a month. It was lovely. I theoretically could make each of these a different post, but I'm choosing to smash 30 days of writing together into a single document. Newest stuff is on the bottom.

Here we go:

## 2022-10-28 Increasing Agency

Here's some thoughts around agency, and children, and relatedly adults:

Article 1: [Cultivating agency (Nadia Eghbal)](https://nadia.xyz/agency)

> My sense is that those with a strong sense of personal agency don’t always realize that not everyone shares this position. Instead of responding to antinatalist arguments with thinly-cloaked shaming and appeals to the “natural” self, I think it’d be more effective to respond by teaching people a sense of personal agency. If more people believe they can control their environment and be the change they want to see in the world, I hope they’d be inspired to raise the next generation: not as victims, but as the heroes of our future.

> “[A]n imperfect struggle to live well and love a world badly in need of repair is better than staying still because things are terrible.”

Article 2: [The Most Precious Resource is Agency (Simon Sarris)](https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency)

> The act of creation causes imagination, not the other way around. To understand this is to understand the ecology that fosters the unique. Agency is precious because the lucidities that purposeful work and responsibility bring are the real education. The secret of the world is that it is a very malleable place, we must be sure that people learn this, and never forget the order: Learning is naturally the consequence of doing.

Additionally, I would recommend Ivan Illych's [Deschooling Society](https://www.amazon.com/Deschooling-Society-Open-Forum-S/dp/0714508799)

# 2022-10-29 Ken Burn's _Holocaust_ Documentary

Today, I spoke with someone about [The U.S. and the Holocaust](https://www.amazon.com/Episode-Three-Homeless-Tempest-Tossed/dp/B0B6HDYBRL/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=ken+burns+holocaust+documentary&qid=1666997977&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIxLjUxIiwicXNhIjoiMS42NSIsInFzcCI6IjAuNjIifQ%3D%3D&s=instant-video&sprefix=ken+burns+h%2Cinstant-video%2C183&sr=1-1) by Ken Burns.

I really like Ken Burn's stuff, and am slowly working through his entire anthology. I'm also working through Studio Ghibli's anthology, very different vibe, more on that another time.

I keep coming around to how dangerous and harmful the association of "white people" is. "Whiteness", and protecting white, protestant America, the American way of life, patriotism, nationalism.

I no longer call myself white, I call myself "white-passing", beacuse I am. My mom's parents are paraguayan, so I'm half south american, by blood. But her dad is indiginous indian ([Guaranì](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaran%C3%AD_people)), and her mom's family hails from Rosés, Spain, in the Catalan region.

The documentary is potent. Hitler was really impressed with how the federal government of the USA conducted regimes of ethnic cleansing against the original populations of the region (native populations), and he was impressed with the government's regime of social control for black people.

He considered expelling the jews from the region between germany and modern-day russia to be similar to how the US government "conquored the west".

White people who hated black people [invented Euclidean zoning in the 1920s]({% link _posts/2020-08-17-1922-atlanta-zoning-plan-with-comments.md %}). Euclidean zoning is a cute term for a regime of social control implemented at the municipal code level, mediated through permits and applications.

Ford (Henry Ford, you know him) was a HUUUUGE fan of Hitler. Ford and GM (the companies, you know them) were some of the biggest advocates of certain regimes of social control outlined in [The Slaughter of Cities: Urban Renewal as Ethnic Cleansing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2023854.The_Slaughter_of_Cities)

# 2022-10-30 Banned Books

America has it's own version of the Holocaust. It involved the jews, and Black people, people of Asian decent, and Native populations.

When you're done with the next few paragraphs, if I am successful, you'll have an embodied sense that the federal government of the USA, and it's supporters, _went to war with ethnic minority populations in America, throughout the 20th century_. I'd argue this history is intentionally lost and hidden from view today.

I've always been attracted to things that at least some people think are bad for me. My parents could regale you with stories about this, probably. Highschool me was a piece of work, and a handful.

Anyway, anytime I find a book that's been banned, at some point, I want to read it.

I read [Maus I & Maus II](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15196.Maus_I?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=pc7VBbc5YT&rank=1) recently after learning that they got banned by some [random schoolboard](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=maus+banned).

I hope to some day create a free little library, full of books that have been banned at some point.

It's my little anarchest, provacative attempt at changing the world. I'd put a sign on the outside that says "be careful! These books have been banned!" and I'd add a little explainer inside of each book about who banned it, when, and why _you, dear reader, are making the world a better place by reading it_.

I'm annoying.

I've read some books that I think _would_ be banned, if institutions today still could ban books, or maybe they _wish_ they could ban a book but are not dumb enough to forget about the [Streisand effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect).

For example, if I could get every Christian bookstore to stock [The Origins of Proslavery Christianity: White and Black Evangelicals in Colonial and Antebellum Virginia](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/2507760), I'd die a happy man.

This book, given to a moderately attentive highschooler, would permanetly change the trajectory of their life. I read it for the first tine in 2017, because in _reading the title_ I knew I would have to read the whole book.

This book would be banned, but it's currently low-profile enough it doesn't need to be banned - it's better for modern religious institutions to just act like it doesn't exist.

Anyway, I found the modern-day equivalent of a banned book. It's banned from Amazon! (I emailed the company, asked why I wasn't able to purchase it from Amazon, then said "Amazon de-listed our books!")

### [The Slaughter of Cities: Urban Renewal as Ethnic Cleansing](https://www.fidelitypress.org/slaughter-of-cities)

It's riveting, albeit challenging to wade through. It's huge, almost 700 pages, and isn't organized in a 'traditional' way.

I'll grab quotes from it at some point, but this book is _banging_. If you want a take-down of western culture, and a book that pulls the covers back on the evil things done in the world under the name of helping others, this is the book for you!

Do you know a lot about [Urban Renewal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_renewal)? From Wikipedia:

> Urban renewal (also called urban regeneration in the United Kingdom and urban redevelopment in the United States[1]) is a program of land redevelopment often used to address urban decay in cities. Urban renewal involves the clearing out of blighted areas in inner cities to clear out slums and create opportunities for higher class housing, businesses, and other developments.
>
> A primary purpose of urban renewal is to restore economic viability to a given area by attracting external private and public investment and by encouraging business start-ups and survival.[2] It is controversial for its eventual displacement and destabilization of low-income residents, including African Americans and other marginalized groups.

Plenty of cities in America still have active urban renewal authorities. I live in Golden. Here's some links. I include the URLs, because URLs tell a lot. These are all institutions formally associated with municipal governments:

Here's a prototypical example of "urban renewal" meets "highway planning":

A long time ago, years, I wrote a short post every day. For a month. It was lovely. I theoretically could make each of these a different post, but I'm choosing to smash 30 days of writing together into a single document. Newest stuff is on the bottom.

Here we go:

## 2022-10-28 Increasing Agency

Here's some thoughts around agency, and children, and relatedly adults:

Article 1: [Cultivating agency (Nadia Eghbal)](https://nadia.xyz/agency)

> My sense is that those with a strong sense of personal agency don’t always realize that not everyone shares this position. Instead of responding to antinatalist arguments with thinly-cloaked shaming and appeals to the “natural” self, I think it’d be more effective to respond by teaching people a sense of personal agency. If more people believe they can control their environment and be the change they want to see in the world, I hope they’d be inspired to raise the next generation: not as victims, but as the heroes of our future.

> “[A]n imperfect struggle to live well and love a world badly in need of repair is better than staying still because things are terrible.”

Article 2: [The Most Precious Resource is Agency (Simon Sarris)](https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency)

> The act of creation causes imagination, not the other way around. To understand this is to understand the ecology that fosters the unique. Agency is precious because the lucidities that purposeful work and responsibility bring are the real education. The secret of the world is that it is a very malleable place, we must be sure that people learn this, and never forget the order: Learning is naturally the consequence of doing.

Additionally, I would recommend Ivan Illych's [Deschooling Society](https://www.amazon.com/Deschooling-Society-Open-Forum-S/dp/0714508799)

# 2022-10-29 Ken Burn's _Holocaust_ Documentary

Today, I spoke with someone about [The U.S. and the Holocaust](https://www.amazon.com/Episode-Three-Homeless-Tempest-Tossed/dp/B0B6HDYBRL/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=ken+burns+holocaust+documentary&qid=1666997977&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIxLjUxIiwicXNhIjoiMS42NSIsInFzcCI6IjAuNjIifQ%3D%3D&s=instant-video&sprefix=ken+burns+h%2Cinstant-video%2C183&sr=1-1) by Ken Burns.

I really like Ken Burn's stuff, and am slowly working through his entire anthology. I'm also working through Studio Ghibli's anthology, very different vibe, more on that another time.

I keep coming around to how dangerous and harmful the association of "white people" is. "Whiteness", and protecting white, protestant America, the American way of life, patriotism, nationalism.

I no longer call myself white, I call myself "white-passing", beacuse I am. My mom's parents are paraguayan, so I'm half south american, by blood. But her dad is indiginous indian ([Guaranì](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaran%C3%AD_people)), and her mom's family hails from Rosés, Spain, in the Catalan region.

The documentary is potent. Hitler was really impressed with how the federal government of the USA conducted regimes of ethnic cleansing against the original populations of the region (native populations), and he was impressed with the government's regime of social control for black people.

He considered expelling the jews from the region between germany and modern-day russia to be similar to how the US government "conquored the west".

White people who hated black people [invented Euclidean zoning in the 1920s]({% link _posts/2020-08-17-1922-atlanta-zoning-plan-with-comments.md %}). Euclidean zoning is a cute term for a regime of social control implemented at the municipal code level, mediated through permits and applications.

Ford (Henry Ford, you know him) was a HUUUUGE fan of Hitler. Ford and GM (the companies, you know them) were some of the biggest advocates of certain regimes of social control outlined in [The Slaughter of Cities: Urban Renewal as Ethnic Cleansing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2023854.The_Slaughter_of_Cities)

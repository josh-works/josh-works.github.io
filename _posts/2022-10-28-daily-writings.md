A long time ago, years, I wrote a short post every day. For a month. It was lovely.

Here we go:

## 2022-10-28 Increasing Agency

Here's some thoughts around agency, and children, and relatedly adults:

Article 1: [Cultivating agency (Nadia Eghbal)](https://nadia.xyz/agency)

> My sense is that those with a strong sense of personal agency don’t always realize that not everyone shares this position. Instead of responding to antinatalist arguments with thinly-cloaked shaming and appeals to the “natural” self, I think it’d be more effective to respond by teaching people a sense of personal agency. If more people believe they can control their environment and be the change they want to see in the world, I hope they’d be inspired to raise the next generation: not as victims, but as the heroes of our future.

> “[A]n imperfect struggle to live well and love a world badly in need of repair is better than staying still because things are terrible.”

Article 2: [The Most Precious Resource is Agency (Simon Sarris)](https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency)

> The act of creation causes imagination, not the other way around. To understand this is to understand the ecology that fosters the unique. Agency is precious because the lucidities that purposeful work and responsibility bring are the real education. The secret of the world is that it is a very malleable place, we must be sure that people learn this, and never forget the order: Learning is naturally the consequence of doing.

Additionally, I would recommend Ivan Illych's [Deschooling Society](https://www.amazon.com/Deschooling-Society-Open-Forum-S/dp/0714508799)

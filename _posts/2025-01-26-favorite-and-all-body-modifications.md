## Introduction

In the range of the human experience, there's a lot of possible body modifications one can purchase for oneself. Over the years, I've purchased three.

# LASIK Vision Correction, ~2016

When I was pretty young, my then-employer placed like $5000/yr into an HSA account for me. When they first rolled it out, I wasn't doing much 'health related' spending, so it was just sitting there, but HSAs also count as some sort of investment vehicle, so I was pleased to put money into it, and leave it, etc. 

It wasn't free money, but it also wasn't not.

Anyway, for about $3500, I got LASIK, and I often told people "It's the best thing I've ever purchased". I used to take contacts out of my eyes in tents, then wake up and try to get contacts back in my eyes. Driving in the morning into the rising sun, wishing I had sunglasses, but preferring the comfort of my glasses. At night, not being able to see clearly while moving around my room until I put my glasses on. Issues with helmets, hair. I didn't actually dislike my glasses much, but it wasn't until I was fully free of them, post surgury, that I could feel in my bones all the ways I was accommodating my need for HEFTY vision correction. I'm pleased that I had a great, normal-ideal outcome from the surgury.

# Tongue Tie "Revision"/Repair

Eden was born in 2021 with a severe tongue tie that was causing her to not be able to breastfeed! We were lucky and fortunate to get it fixed when she was five or six days old, but at that point it had been missed by many medical professionals. She'd been losing weight, basically starving, because her mouth couldn't generate suction. Her mom's milk wasn't coming in. For the mom's body to make milk, the baby needs to be 'requesting' it, and if the tongue and lips are not free to move in the right way, there is no good requesting going on. 

After that, I didn't think about a tongue tie again for years. "It's heritable" they say. eventually, it bubbled up in my brain a few times.

I explain more, much more, in the blog post about this thing, this "tongue tie fix". It was ithin the last year of today, early 2025. 

[i got my tongue tie fixed, and it rocked my world]({{ site.baseurl  }}{% link _posts/2024-05-12-tongue-tie.md%}). 

That was cheaper than the lasik, overall, between the actual proceedure, and the functional therapy before and after. Tongue tie's correlate to things (that I was actively experiencing) like: all sorts of mouth problems, sleep-apnea-like symptoms, sometimes sounding like I'm choking while sleeping, but I didn't snore. 

I had some of the best sleep of my life after the tongue tie revision. 

I had teeth grinding issues - when one's tongue falls across ones airways, the brain fixes the problem/free the tongue by telling the jaw to wiggle. dang. I didn't appreciate how free the structures SHOULD be, between the tongue, throat, sternum, and the top of the spine. After mine was fixed, my head sat in a slightly different tilt/orientation, and there's less/zero forward lean and there's less strain on my lower back. I could say much more, I suggest reading the blog post, doing your own at-home functional asessments, and going from there. If you do have a tongue tie and get it fixed and do myofunctional therapy, you're gonna get to know all the structures related to your tongue _very_ well.

# Vasectomy, permanent birth control

Also last year I realized that even though I had one kid and certainly didn't want more, I'd not actually yet done the thing to accomplish that for myself. 

I'm a fan of condoms, and if everyone has a clean and recent STI panel, the only remaining reason for a condom is the REALLY CRITICAL ISSUE of not getting pregnant. I have a friend who has a friend who's then partner lied to him about taking birth control, and intentionally, without his permission, became pregnant by him. Horrifying. There's lots of good ways of not getting pregnant, and most of them seem fully, unfairly, on the shoulders of the person who has the uterus. 

Virtually all forms of birth control available to the people who can get pregant are heavy duty. IUD or the pill, both are a hassle, and IUD placements are often enough very, very bad experiences.

I don't want to have more kids. 

I have a lot of thoughts about the obligation of not getting anyone pregnant. Things went poorly with my kid's mom, I wouldn't have tried to do parenthood in the exact way I'm doing it now, and EVEN IF things had gone great with Eden and her mom, _I still would want a vasectomy for myself_.

It's easy to be generous as a parent with time when there is one child. It's easy to be generous with emotional energy. It's easy(er) to be unpressured in schedule, location needs, etc. Multiple kids seems gnarly, all-consuming. 

American culture is individualistic, so there's no natural community for raising multiple kids. For this reason alone I think it's fairest to everyone, including any already-born children, to not take from their resource pool what would be needed by another child in the mix. 

Anyway, the vasectomy was the "right" kind. There's lots of shady work to be had in Denver, I was thrilled to discover [Chris Tonozzi](https://govasectomy.com/), who does no scalpel vasectomy With no needle anesthesia. Super chill, quick, he's got spots around colorado, I took the flatiron flyer bus from Denver to a few blocks from his office in Boulder, caught a later bus back, and was good to go. No more kids for me.

I really struggle to find the right tone to talk about some of these things. 

I've spoken about vasectomies now with a few different friends. I heard from one of them of a basically older person, with multiple kids, WHO DOES NOT WANT MORE KIDS, who does not want a vasectomy and wants his partner to continue to use birth control to not get pregnant!!!!! 

This was wild to me, and I was like "why are these people still together?"

that's maybe a bit strong, but... the risk profile is not the same. It's wildly risky to become pregant! people plan for and hope to have kids all the time, and are anxious throughout the process, because it's risky.

Acting like one doesn't want a pregancy doesn't change that it's still risky territory. one of my friends who is a man and has sex with other men says "a lot was crappy about growing up gay in texas, but not worrying about getting anyone pregant was nice."

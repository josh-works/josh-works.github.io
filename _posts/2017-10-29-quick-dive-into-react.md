_As usual, this is a work in progress. At a high level, I'm familiarizing myself with Phoenix/Elixir, and need to sharpen my React knowledge along the way._

After [working through part 1](_posts/2017-10-28-elixir-phoenix-part-deux.md) of a [slack clone in Elixir/Phoenix tutorial](https://medium.com/@benhansen/lets-build-a-slack-clone-with-elixir-phoenix-and-react-part-1-project-setup-3252ae780a1), I ran into some errors getting the React app up and running.

I expect errors, but don't have enough familiarity with React to effectively debug, so I'm going to take a quick spin through the tool, see what I can quickly learn, and then debug the errors I saw.

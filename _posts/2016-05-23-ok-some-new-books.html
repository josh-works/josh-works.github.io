<p>Yesterday, I proclaimed "<a href="http://josh.works/blog/no-new-books">No new books</a>". I spent a lot of time today thinking about that proclamation.</p>
<p>Do I really want to limit myself to just the books that I've already picked for myself?</p>
<p>Yes. Maybe.</p>
<p>There's a kind of book I don't want to read any more of. That's the "get started with a project" kind of book, or the general productivity stuff that's floating around.</p>
<p>Nate Eliason wrote <a href="http://www.nateliason.com/infomania/"><em>Fighting Infomania: Why 80% of Your Reading is a Waste of Time</em></a>, and I wholeheartedly agree.</p>
<p>So, I'm trying to reduce the consumption of tactical knowledge when it's not helpful, or when I cannot act on it. I want to dwell on substantial, helpful literature, and maybe even find a few books I'd like to read twice.</p>
<p>I don't read TONS of fiction, so I don't see that as a habit I should try to give up.</p>
<p>So, in short, I'm trying to reduce books that are:</p>
<ul>
<li>written recently</li>
<li>non-fiction</li>
<li>business related</li>
</ul>
<p>Nate <a href="http://www.nateliason.com/infomania/">summarized</a> better than I can:</p>
<blockquote>[Don't read it...] if it doesn’t answer a specific question you’re currently asking, cover philosophical knowledge, or entertain you, then don’t read it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Words to live by.</blockquote>
<p>PS This was prompted by my friend Alex making a sci-fi book recommendation. His recommendations are always excellent, so I felt like my priorities had to be wrong if I banned myself from following up on his suggestions.</p>

I speak with many persons who are _considering_ becoming software developers (usually by way of a program like the [Flatiron School](https://www.coursereport.com/schools/flatiron-school) or the [Turing School](https://www.coursereport.com/schools/turing#/reviews)).

I'm a graduate of the Turing School, and have written a lot about the program, like: 
- [My reflections on Turing]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/turing.md %})
- [an 8-part guide to take you from _slightly_ prepared to ridiculously prepared for the back-end program]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-05-09-turing_prework_01_intro.md %})
- a bespoke [Turing prep for parents]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/2020-04-10-turing-parent-prep.md %})
- [job-hunting advice for Turing grads (and anyone else)]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-02-26-turing_remote_resources.md %})

I recommend _strongly_ the following books and articles _all the time_. They are broadly helpful no matter where you are in your career (or if you don't have one! A "career" is a luxury, a "job" puts a roof over your head.)

This is a copy/paste from a recent conversation. I'm going to stop copy/pasting these four links to people all the dang time, and instead send them to this page you're reading right now:

other person:

Me: 
> Read these two books, and these two articles. The books are available at your local library in any format you'd want. The articles are long, give them appropriate attention:

<p>My most recent <a href="/blog/2013/09/18/persistence">blog</a> <a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/5586fe4be4b0278244ce9f01/5586fe9ee4b0278244ceab74/1434910366292/?format=original">posts</a> were a pile of steaming something. I was trying to get something published that week, because I committed myself to doing just that.
And then I felt terrible - all I did was waste people's time. I had wasted my own time, and now I was multiplying the damage many times, by wasting other's time as well.</p>
<p>Never again will I post something that wastes your time. Those of you subscribed via email, or who come in via twitter, I value you. I apologize for pushing out crappy content.</p>
<p>I read a great article called "<a href="http://thinktraffic.net/write-epic-shit">Write Epic S**t!</a>". The premise is simple. If you want to have a blog that people read, produce things worth reading.</p>
<p>To that end, I am evaluating every article I post on if I think it will produce value for those who read it. If I don't think it will, I won't post. I'd rather have zero content for three weeks than six junky articles that help no one.</p>
<p><strong> Today's value producing nugget:</strong></p>
<p>Sweet potatoes. Of the mashed variety.</p>
<p>I <i>love</i>Â sweet potatoes, but cooking them is a pain. I don't like running my oven in the summer because it heats up our entire apartment, and I don't like chopping and handling every single stick of sweet potato. I want something mass-produced, that scales well.</p>
<p>And I found it. I've had it before, but had never made it myself. Mashed sweet potatoes.</p>
<p>The recipe is easy, and the product is delicious. If you never cook for yourself, this is still worth doing. The recipe calls for three pounds of sweet potatoes - that's one bag worth. This allows you to create a LOT of food with very little effort.</p>
<p>Here's the recipe: <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/rachael-ray/mashed-sweet-potatoes-recipe/index.html">Mashed Sweet Potatoes</a></p>
<p>Use chicken broth if you can and brown sugar if you can. Even if you skip everything else, it will be amazing.</p>
<p>Go forth and be changed.</p>

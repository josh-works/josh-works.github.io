<p>Dr. BJ Fogg runs <a href="http://tinyhabits.com/">Tiny Habits</a>, a one-week course on building new habits.
Since most of what we do is governed by habits, it is reasonable to study how to build new ones, or replace bad ones.</p>
<p>I <a href="/blog/2013/01/21/tiny-habits" title="Tiny Habits">have done his course before</a>, and had success. I have been reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Free-Spending-Your-Money-Matters/dp/0830836497">Free </a>with Kristi and some good friends of ours, and want to work more small but substantive things into my life. I am starting small, with the recommended item of flossing being Tiny Habit #1. I want to learn the methodology before trying too many habits of my own.</p>
<p>Habit #2 is "Mindful Breathing", a la Google Employee Chade Meng Tan's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Search-Inside-Yourself-Unexpected-Achieving/dp/0062116924">Search Inside Yourself</a>. He writes about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_intelligence">Emotional Intelligence</a>. Worth the read.</p>

Dr. BJ Fogg runs 
[Tiny Habits](http://tinyhabits.com/), a one-week course on building new habits.
Since most of what we do is governed by habits, it is reasonable to study how to build new ones, or replace bad ones.



I 
[have done his course before](/blog/2013/01/21/tiny-habits), and had success. I have been reading 
[Free](http://www.amazon.com/Free-Spending-Your-Money-Matters/dp/0830836497)with Kristi and some good friends of ours, and want to work more small but substantive things into my life. I am starting small, with the recommended item of flossing being Tiny Habit #1. I want to learn the methodology before trying too many habits of my own.



Habit #2 is "Mindful Breathing", a la Google Employee Chade Meng Tan's book 
[Search Inside Yourself](http://www.amazon.com/Search-Inside-Yourself-Unexpected-Achieving/dp/0062116924). He writes about 
[Emotional Intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_intelligence). Worth the read.

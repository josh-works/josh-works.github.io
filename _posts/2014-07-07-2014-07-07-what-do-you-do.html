<p>I enjoy meeting new people. Usually, one of the first questions I'll ask them is "What to you do?"
They usually respond with their occupation, or their status in school. My follow-up question is "When you're not doing that, what do you do?"</p>
<p>Sometimes this is a conversational dead-end. Sometimes they really light up. This is always exciting. We're not our jobs, but we are some component of what we do. So do something that's exciting, and be excited about it. Do you like knitting? Then knit up a storm. If you like video games, well... maybe that's exciting. Some folks have monetized their video-game playing. That's exciting. Do exciting things. Then come tell me about 'em. I want to hear.</p>

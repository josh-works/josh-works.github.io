There are lots of dead people that we look up to. But people that are alive, and not world-wide famous are a bit more knowable. Some of them will even reply to tweets you send them!



So, here are a few people that I follow and have received TONS of amazing wisdom from. (I recommend getting on all of their email lists.)



They deal with money, jobs, and doing good work:


* [Ramit Sethi](http://twitter.com/ramit), 
[I Will Teach](http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/)


* [Brennan Dunn](https://twitter.com/brennandunn), 
[Double Your Freelancing](https://doubleyourfreelancing.com/), which applies not just to freelancers but anyone trying to do good work.


* [Amy Hoy](https://twitter.com/amyhoy), who's "
[year of hustle](http://yearofhustle.com/)" calendar is a great place to start.


* [Patrick McKenzie](https://twitter.com/patio11), famous around the world for tons of 
[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=patio11) comments. A great recent starting point is 
[the Daenerys Targaryen test](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11743920). After that, read 
[his blog](http://www.kalzumeus.com/greatest-hits/).


These have been the people I share with anyone when job-related discussions pop up. Jobs 
technically don't define us, but that's sure hard to tell. If you don't like your job, read the above resources. If you like your job, read the above resources.

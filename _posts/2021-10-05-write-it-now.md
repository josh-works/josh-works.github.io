## The original post

_note from October 5, 2021: This was typed up/published in about 20 minutes, took 2x as long as I wish it had. I could make it 10x better with another hour of work, but I only have 20 minutes._


I'm a fan of "conceptual frameworks"

This concept has been important to me:

![write-it-now](/images/2020-07-21-write-it-now.jpg)

I've referenced it, almost apologetically, in a few other things I've written recently.

Usually I've just slapped it into an email or linked from another blog post, as a bit of an "i'm sorry" for how much work I might demand from the reader, or how unpleasant or confusing what I'm writing might be.

I feel like I often self-censure in an attempt to make something "better" than it is, and in doing so, fall off the back of this curve. (or I let vague concerns about quality/execution/time delay me from writing anything, ever)

I will reference this page regularly, in some ways to act as a defense against some very obvious criticisms. IMO, I'd rather throw 10 things as the wall quickly in a week, instead of 1 thing every other week.

If I propose something that sparks "controversy", however that is defined, I'll gladly cross that bridge (or burn it, if need be) when I get there.

If you're a software developer, and use Github, you are welcome to leave a comment below (the link takes you to a comment on a dedicated Github Issue page: [https://github.com/josh-works/josh-works.github.io/issues/49](https://github.com/josh-works/josh-works.github.io/issues/49)), or on any page around here with this link. I added this comments thing only recently, and still have not scripted an API call to auto-generate a new github issue when I write a new post. So... I just don't bother, at least some of the time.

Here's other things I've written along this vein:

- [My own thinking is severely limited]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2015-11-05-limitations-of-my-own-thinking.md %})
- [Driven by Compression Progress: A Simple Principle Explains Essential Aspects of Subjective Beauty, Novelty, Surprise, Interestingness, Attention, Curiosity, Creativity, Art, Science, Music, Jokes]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2021-02-18-driven-by-compression-progress.md %})

[^noteworthy]: There were some very lovely comments in the hackernews thread. Here's a portion of [this comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31760857):

    > It's hard because it probably won't change the world, but it becomes much harder when shouting.
    >
    > It's entirely OK to sit and write without fanfare, we're not wizards or witches any longer, just plain people with the same plain obligation towards the mind as towards the body: tend, feed, and regularly empty out.
    >
    > If today you really gotta go write, go ahead, knock yourself out.
    >
    > If tomorrow you just scribble in the margins of empty pages but nothing comes, have a bath or a nap or both, and sit again the day after.
    >
    > I also find it very helpful to remember that I'm not addressing others when writing, I'm not in a possibly empty auditorium talking into the void, instead I'm reaching across time and continue a discussion I started with myself earlier, and may pick up again later.


## Updates to this post

### 2022-06-15

I periodically re-visit and update things I've written in the past. This post is one of them. Sometimes I modify my writing substantially - it's simply text files in a git repository, therefore all of what you see around here could be considered in some various form of draft. 

I've considered adding links to every page on my website that say "click here to see prior versions of this file". I perceive a feeling of some obligation to the reader to note every time there's been an edit, or at least _some_ of the time when I might edit things. But obviously fixing typos doesn't need to be called out in detail. 

Additionally, it's sometimes fun to bury hot takes in walls of text. For example, does the following text seem sort of dry, and academic to you? It's intentional, if it does:

> In [The Slaughter of Cities](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2023854.The_Slaughter_of_Cities), the author tells a compelling tale of how one ethnic group sucessfully perpetuated ethnic cleansing upon other ethnic groups.

It's passive voice, it's just a link to a goodreads page for a book. It doesn't sound as provocative as it otherwise could. So if it does/does not get the intended result, one could turn it up or down a bit. For example, how does this phrasing compare?

> In [The Slaughter of Cities: Urban Renewal as Ethnic Cleansing](https://www.fidelitypress.org/book-products/the-slaughter-of-cities) we read the many ways American urban renewal programs in the 1950s and 60's were run to create ghettos and perpetuate acts of ethnic cleansing. Those people attacked essentially every non-white ethnic group they encountered, and the relevence of all this is very much in the room with us right now, in most ways that matter.'

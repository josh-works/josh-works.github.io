It's useful to know when to write about something. I feel like I often self-censure in an attempt to make something better than it should be, and in doing so, fall off the back of this curve.

I will reference this page regularly, in some ways to act as a defense against some very obvious criticisms. IMO, I'd rather throw 10 things as the wall quickly in a week, instead of 1 thing every other week. 

If I propose something that sparks "controversy", however that is defined, I'll gladly cross that bridge (or burn it, if need be) when I get there.

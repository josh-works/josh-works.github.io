<p>A few days ago I started writing a list, and it very quickly became very long. All it was was a list of things I would like to do. Most of the things would fit neatly into categories labeled <em>self-improvement, job/income, </em>or <em>relationships.</em>
Within those categories, I'm usually trying to develop either competence or freedom.</p>
<p>As I look through the list (I'll publish it here soon) I'm struck by how much willpower and effort could be expended, completing even half the items on that list. While few things on the list are objectively difficult, as a whole, it's a very daunting concept.</p>
<p>So, rather than attacking items head on, I want to be strategic. I don't want to get good at doing hard things. I want to get good at making hard things easy.</p>

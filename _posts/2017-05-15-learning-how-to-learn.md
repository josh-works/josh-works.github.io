I've recently been thinking about learning how to learn, specifically in the context of software development.

I am a bit hyperactive when it comes to trying to learn new things, so over the last few years, I've done a lot of _inneffective_ learning, and at least a little bit of _effective_ learning.

I'm defining "learning" or "learning a topic" as _able to rearrange or reorganize or reuse the idea in new ways to resolve unstructured problems you face_.

This "rearranging/reorganizing" and "unstructured problems" explicitly excludes the kind of learning most of us have done when we were young, where we just tried to have the right answer for fill-in-the-blank questions like "In _____(year) Christopher Columbus sailed the ocean blue"

If you have to learn things that you don't know now, read on.

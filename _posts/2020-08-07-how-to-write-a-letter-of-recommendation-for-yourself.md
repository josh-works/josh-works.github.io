I meet regularly with early-career software developers. A few recurring meetings, 1x/week, plus ad-hoc calls as needed with others.

A question came up recently:

> My three-month internship is close to wrapping up. The Co-founder/CEO/lead developer of the consulting company I'm at likes me, said he wishes he could hire me but cannot, because they don't have enough work in the pipeline.
>
> He said he'd write me a letter of recommendation, and asked me to draft it for him.
>
> How do I write my own letter of recommendation, for my first real software development job?

I explained a few concepts that we wanted to "speak to" in the letter. I'll explain.

The software developer that I meet with mentioned that the CEO's advice on the next job included "be able to speak to low liability".

I wanted to dig into this "liability" piece.

## How much does a bad hire cost?

What's the biggest risk in hiring?

It's _the risk of a bad hire_.

How much does it cost to make a bad hire?

I would conservatively estimate that it costs $100,000 and nine months of your life:

1. 1 month and 10 hours of labor at $75/hr to find/interview the candidate (the hiring manager would prefer to be doing _literally anything else but hiring_)
2. Extend an offer, wait two or three more weeks (the team is currently short-staffed, and has been for a long time. That's why they're hiring you.)
3. Start date! Start paying $150,000/yr or $3000/week for your shiny new employee. 
4. Pay $12,000 for the first month of them working, figuring out your dev environment, ticket management, who knows what parts of the codebase, and a few easy bug fixes
5. Start getting nervous. Employee not batting it out of the park like you'd hoped. Maybe still onboarding, give it another month (and $12,000).
6. OK. Three months in and $36,000 in payroll later, you're pretty sure there's a problem.
7. Start the pre-Performance Improvement Plan work. Talk to their team, their manager, them. Why is it not working? Why is the team _working slower_ with this new team member, instead of working faster? _Not only are you wasting five figures of payroll, the rest of your expensive dev team is producing less as well!_
8. Pre-PIP work is over. Another $5k in payroll gone forever. Now it's time to give the formal PIP, which everyone knows is "beginning the firing process"
9. Two more months and $24,000 in payroll later, you fire the employee. 
10. You feel relief with having gotten rid of the bad employee. You're thrilled that you can get back to normal work.

Add up the time/expense:

1. 1 month trying to find a candidate
2. 7-8 months (and $84K-$96k) to hire, trial them, try to help them be successful, give up on that plan, and fire them
3. Many hours spent thinking about this specific problem, talking with others about it

there's nine months of your life. That's 9 months of time, sure, but it's also 9 months of _opportunity cost_. What if you'd hired a great candidate? they'd be rapidly approaching their first year on the job, and everyone would be happy about it. 

Here's the really scary part. To large organizations, _wasting $100k is meaningless_. The entire organization would be most annoyed at having _lost the time of a productive software developer_. They don't care that they may as well have burnt a pile of money, _they're annoyed that their competitor is getting new features out the door and gaining marketshare and the future of their $x,000,000 company hangs in the balance_. 

Oh, and the good managers, not only do they want to be wise with money and build features/gain market-share...

They want to see their team flourish. 

Being fired is a life-defining moment. (I speak from experience)

If you're a kind and empathetic person, _it's particularly unpleasent to fire someone and it feels like a personal failure_. 

You want to work for a kind and empathetic manager. (They're not common, but they're not impossible to find.)

So, tailor your letter to speak to the concerns of a kind and empathetic manager. This manager would:

- Want to see you do well
- Want to see you developer your skills and competencies
- Want you to make meaningful contributions to the product
- Want a healthy team dynamic
- Want you to voice concerns and observations as relevant

And much more

## A Primary-goal for an early-career software developer: Telegraph Low Liability

First, when I say `telegraph low liability` I mean it in the [sports definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphing_(sports)):

> In sporting terminology, to **telegraph** is to unintentionally alert an opponent to one's immediate situation or intentions. The sporting use of the term _telegraph_ draws a direct comparison with the communication device of the same name. "Telegraphing" always refers to a reflexive physical action rather than a protracted or intellectual give-away. For example, a boxer rotating his shoulders to throw a hook would be telegraphing.

You should aim to "telegraph" that you're a low-liability hire _without ever saying it so explicitely_. It's a subtle thing, best communicated incidentally, not directly.

Five years ago, I wrote [So you want to work remotely...]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2015-09-21-so-you-want-to-work-remotely.md %})

Quoting myself:

> First, there’s the matter of framing how you go about working remotely. Obviously you want to work remotely, but put yourself in the shoes of a prospective employer. They don’t care if you work remotely or not - they want you to do great work for them and make them an effective, profitable organization. 
> 
> Companies that hire remotely tend to be younger, agile-er, and smaller. So every employee matters. Making a bad hire can be catastrophic in terms of money and [opportunity cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost). Your job is to make it very, very obvious that hiring YOU is a great decision. In fact, you want to be so good at what you do that passing up on you is a terrible decision. 
>
> [...]
> 
> When you can walk someone down the path from “Hire me” to “I’ll help you make $$$,$$$/year more than you would otherwise”, if the the amount you'll make them is 3x your annual salary, you’re in a pretty good place. 

To bring it full circle, here's how I would go about _drafting_ a CEO's Letter of Recommendation _for me_. If you find this idea uncomfortable, don't worry about it. That's a sign of psychological health, that you don't love putting flattering words _about yourself_ into other people's mouths. 

## Six Steps To Draft A Self-Promotional Letter Of Recommendation That A Friendly Boss Requested

Normally, that's a good aversion to have. For this particular situation, you'll have to bite the bullet and move on. I'm not going to give you the actual words (how could I?) but I'll explain my process. I'll include comments throughout:

### 1. Draft the opening/closing

```
Hi there,         # I find it easier to strike a natural tone when thinking relatively informally. 
                  # So, I draft documents, even if they'll end up being formal, informally. 
             
             
Sincerely,        # Yes, I write the closing right after the opening.
- Boss's name, Title, Company
```

### 2. Provide 1 general introduction/context sentance

```
Hi there,

# Establish the relationship. This helps readers contextualize what comes next
I met {person I am recommending} {n months ago} because {internship|coffee meeting|event|etc }.

Sincerely,
- Boss's name, Title, Company
```

### 3. Say a complementary thing about yourself.

This is the first uncomfortable sentance you'll have to write:

```
Hi there,

I met {Josh} {a few months ago} because {he and I crossed paths at a local Ruby meetup}.

# No gushing required. A claim of "I would hire this person if I could" is plenty strong social signaling. 

I wish I could hire him myself, but don't have the budget and work lined up to utilize him to his full potential. 

Sincerely,
- Boss's name, Title, Company
```

### 4. Share an anecdote that touches on the potential you show

This can be hard to think of an anecdote. It might take a few attempts to feel good about the one you've chosen and how you speak of it. Just write something down, see how you feel, delete it, write something else down, etc. 

```
Hi there,

I met {Josh} {a few months ago} because {he and I crossed paths at a local Ruby meetup}.

I wish I could hire him myself, but don't have the budget and work lined up to utilize him to his full potential. 

# add a punchy positive story
When he started at {company}, one of the first things he did was make many updates to our onboarding documentation. 

It was rather out-of-date, and the team hadn't had new hires in a while. 

Any time he ran into friction or trouble, he would hunt down the answer, and immediately update the documentation so the next person would have a smoother process.

Sure enough, the next hire spent half the time he did getting up and running.

# If possible, generalize from that story to a stable attribute that informs your work:
He brings a similar attention to detail and thoughtfullness about "the next person" to all of the work that he does. 

Sincerely,
- Boss's name, Title, Company
```

### 5. Add a sentance offering to speak further about you:



```

I met {Josh} {a few months ago} because {he and I crossed paths at a local Ruby meetup}.

He brings a similar attention to detail and thoughtfullness about "the next person" to all of the work that he does. 

# An offer to provide evidence is functionally the same as evidence, so:
I'd be happy to answer any follow-up questions you might have about Josh. Feel free to email me at `email`

Sincerely,
- Boss's name, Title, Company
```

## Give this letter to your boss for them to edit it to their liking

It may be intimidating to hand something like this to your boss.

> Would they really have said such kind things about me? Won't it be awkward if they read it, and say "eh, you're not this great, lets tone it down a bit."

It would be awkward, but they won't do that.

Instead, they'll be thankful that you did all this work for them. You know what feels terrible?

_really wanting to say a nice thing about someone, but good stories/examples of why they're great don't come to mind. You KNOW there are good stories and examples, but you don't remember them all._

You're solving a big problem for your boss, in writing this letter. **That is why they asked you to draft your own letter of recommendation for them.**

Done! 

If you've been tasked wit writing your own letter of recommendation and it's super intimidating, get in touch and I'll help you out. Writing the first one is the hardest, it gets easier as you go.

<p>There is tension between being content with what you have, and striving for more.
We have all heard the “serenity prayer”:</p>
<blockquote><p>God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
The courage to change the things I can,
And wisdom to know the difference.</p></blockquote>
<p>This prayer is supposedly common in Alcohol Anonymous and other 12 Step programs. A little farther down in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_Prayer">Wikipedia article</a>, however, the whole prayer (attributed to American theologian <a title="Reinhold Niebuhr" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhold_Niebuhr">Reinhold Niebuhr</a>) is printed, and it is different:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>God, give me grace to accept with serenity
The things that cannot be changed,
Courage to change the things
Which <strong>should</strong> be changed,
And the Wisdom to distinguish
The one from the other.</p>
<p>Living one day at a time,
Enjoying one moment at a time,
Accepting hardship as a pathway to peace,
Taking, as Jesus did,
This sinful world as it is,
Not as I would have it,
Trusting that You will make all things right,
If I surrender to Your will,
So that I may be reasonably happy in this life,
And supremely happy with You forever in the next.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there is the original. The difference between the original and the shortened version is <strong>deciding what to change</strong>.</p>
<p>If you sat around and changed <em>only</em> the things you could, you’d change easy things, and insignificant things, because changing hard things and meaningful things is hard. It is hard to change things that <em>should</em> be changed, but those are the only changes worth making. And, the original prayer says nothing about changing what you <strong></strong><em>can.</em> It talks about changing what you <em>should.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action is empowering, and it leads to taking more action.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Action implies making things happen.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Making things happen will eventually lead to failure.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There is great hope in taking action, and there are great lessons to be found in failure. You know how every motivational poster ever to be seen in a school talks about how “You have what it takes” and “You are a beautiful and unique snowflake”?</p>
<p>In addition to being so stupid it hurts, these are wrong. They <em>should</em> say:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Get Shit Done – it will make you feel better about yourself.”</li>
<li>“You are not unique. Millions before you have wrestled with your problems. Some have surpassed you, some have fallen far behind. Until you are dead, there is hope for you.”</li>
<li>Take action. Keep going until you fail. Then try again.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not sure where I am going with all this. But please, go do something meaningful. It is the <em>only</em> thing that matters. Money, your job, your hobby, your friends – none of these matter without something meaningful being done with it or through it.</p>
<p>The good news is you can define what is meaningful. Then you have to do it.</p>

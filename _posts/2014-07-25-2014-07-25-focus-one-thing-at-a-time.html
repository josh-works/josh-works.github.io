<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_117267">The pressure to be working on more than one thing at a time is enormous. This pressure comes from no one but me. And before I dismiss this tendency as "proof that I work too hard", I must take another tact. It comes from a need to satisfy my ego. It is much easier to say "I did not finish that because I got distracted by another project" than "I did not finish because I gave up" or "it was too hard."
My enthusiasm carries me through the opening stages of any project, but quickly wanes. Now is what separates the men from the boys.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_117270">There is a lot on <a href="https://josh-thompson-f385.squarespace.com/epic-quest">The List</a>. Nothing of substance will be accomplished without focus.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_117276">Along the lines of focus: this post was written in Colemak. I did not time it, but it was much less frustrating than yesterday.</p>

> Humans make choices

> Humans are creatures of habit

Both these statements are true, but there is subtle tension between them.

How about a third:

> Humans can choose their habits

Now we're getting somewhere.

Enter B. J. Fogg, owner, operator, and resident scientist of [tinyhabits.com](http://tinyhabits.com/).

I went through his free, one-week experiment in December. I loved it. He tells you about the psychology of habits, and in exchange for this information, you apply it to yourself. He recommends starting small. Very small. Smaller than you think is small. For example, floss one tooth. Do two push ups. Relax for ten seconds.

I am signed up for the (free) session that starts January 21\. Who's joining me?

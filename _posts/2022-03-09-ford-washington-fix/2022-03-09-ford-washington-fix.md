## Do all of these, in the right order/way/buy-in:

1. Install car-friendly roundabouts targeting ~20 mph throughput throughout the city. Please see [about roundabouts]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2022-03-05-about-roundabouts/2022-03-05-about-roundabouts.md %})
1. Block off Washington over the bridge and through downtown, completely. (people can drive along those fancy highways we have, rt 6 and 58)

That's it!

The green line would be made easy for cars to move along.

The yellow lines would indicate where "people first" road design would be used, ultimately, though it'll take a variety of treatments to get it all safe/pleasant/usable in all conditions.

It's not that big of a change, to the cars. This won't fix all the bad traffic, but it will help.

Critically, if you can naturally keep cars (and other vehicles) moving in a close-to-free-flow way, now you can loop streetcars back into the picture, because they can keep up with traffic and such

Do all of these, in the right order/way/buy-in. _btw, i'm pretending it's easy. it's not trivial, but it is doable_:

## Step 1: Install car-friendly roundabouts targeting a ~20 mph throughput speed throughout the city

Please see [about roundabouts]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2022-03-05-about-roundabouts/2022-03-05-about-roundabouts.md %}). 

You'll know it's working when vehicles, with very minimal signage, comfortably and casually move through the city at a speed of about 20 miles per hour, _even on short trips_. 

## Step 2: increase friction to drivers trying to cut through Golden

Here's how google maps "views" the primary roads through some of Golden:

And here's Ford, which you can see very clearly is also many other _big_ roads:

## Step 4: Fix the average throughput problem on rt 6

1. Block off Washington over the bridge and through downtown, completely. (people can drive along those fancy highways we have, rt 6 and 58)

That's it!

The green line would be made easy for cars to move along.

The yellow lines would indicate where "people first" road design would be used, ultimately, though it'll take a variety of treatments to get it all safe/pleasant/usable in all conditions.

It's not that big of a change, to the cars. This won't fix all the bad traffic, but it will help.

Critically, if you can naturally keep cars (and other vehicles) moving in a close-to-free-flow way, now you can loop streetcars back into the picture, because they can keep up with traffic and such

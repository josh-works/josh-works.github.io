<p>It's tempting to track results, when trying to accomplish something.</p>

<p>If you're working on any project of sufficient size, the results will come
slowly, fitfully, and sometimes not at all.</p>

<p>So, don't track results, track your efforts. (Yes, how very American of me.
I don't believe in participation awards, or helicopter parenting, etc. Bear
with me.)</p>

<p>Time box your efforts (one month is a nice period of time) and then do your
"input" for one month. At the end of the month, step back and look for the
results.</p>

<p>But don't do the thing a few times, and expect results quickly. That's an
easy way to get frustrated.</p>

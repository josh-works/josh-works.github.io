<p>I don't do New Years resolutions, but I like to think back on the last year.</p>
<p>I'll touch on two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The most important thing I've learned this year: Tactical Silence</li>
<li>Most dangerous books of 2016</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="tactical-silence">Tactical Silence</h1>
<p>I suspect that a year from now, I'm going to look back and say "Man, I really dropped the ball on a lot of conversations and relationships up through 2016".</p>
<p><em>Old Josh</em> thought discussions went somewhere, and that I could change minds with words, in conversations directly about the thing I wanted to change.</p>
<p>Hah. A helpful-but-reluctant read through <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1303.The_48_Laws_of_Power?ac=1&amp;from_search=true">48 Laws of Power</a>, couples with reading through <em>Life Together</em>, and a few other sources, convinced me that direct discussion about most things where I'm trying to convince someone of something is more "entertaining-though-possibly-damaging pastime" than "productive effort". This holds true in the work and private domains.</p>
<p><em>New Josh</em> is significantly more cynical, and in most situations much less inflamatory. I don't stand to gain anything from debates, and neither does the person I'm debating with. </p>
<p>What DOES matter is action. No one really cares what I <em>think</em> about anything, but as soon as I take <em>action</em> on something, any potential conversation is dramatically shifted.</p>
<p>Conversations go from hypothetical:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if x happens</p>
<p>If that thing is true, than it might mean this other thing is false!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to historical:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, you did X, and it seems like Y and Z happened, so I guess going forward we'll do...</p>
<p>I know I said X in the past, but it looks like we're seeing Y results, and IMPORTANT_PERSON suggests Z response.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, now, when someone says something that is (to me) catastrophically untrue, about either myself or anything else, I just smile and nod. Even if I need to do something about it, it's rare that addressing it right then will drive any useful change.</p>
<p>"Tactical Silence" is still new to me, so I imagine in another month I'll have much more coherent and consistent thoughts on it, but by then I'll probably not want to talk about it. </p>
<p>(I don't even know where the term came from. I feel better keeping my mouth shut when it's a <em>tactical</em> decision, instead of <em>backing down from conflict</em>)</p>
<h1 id="dangerous-books">Dangerous books</h1>
<p>I read a lot last year. More than I plan on reading for a while, and along the way, I read many books that I wouldn't really recommend to others, and a few that I would.</p>
<p>A <em>dangerous</em> book is one that did one of two two things, against my will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forced behavioral change in my daily or weekly routine</li>
<li>Forced my thinking to change on a specific topic or domain</li>
</ul>
<p>These books are dangerous because they're driving changes in how I behave and/or how I think. I am able to exert precious little control over both of these things, and am therefore exceedingly wary in letting outside influences in. So, when something <em>forces</em> me to behave or think differently, I must admit temporary defeat, even though I'm inevitably improved in the process.</p>
<p>I don't <em>endorse</em> any of these, though there's lots of potential value in all of them.</p>
<p>Here's the books that I label as <em>dangerous</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10266902-selfish-reasons-to-have-more-kids">Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/998062.The_Market_for_Liberty">The Market for Liberty</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work">Deep Work</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174845.Life_Together">Life Together</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33229792-80-000-hours">80,000 Hours</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>If your curiosity is even remotely piqued on any of these books, check out reviews on Amazon or GoodReads.</em></p>
<h3 id="selfish-reasons-to-have-more-kids">Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids</h3>
<p>This easily pushed me over the edge from "I don't look forward at all to the burdens of parenthood" to "it'll be hard, but I think the reward will fairly quickly outpace the effort, and the long-term gains certainly outweigh the short-term sacrifice."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Josh, that's a terrible reason to have kids. You think the long-term gains outweigh the short-term sacrifice? What about love, and your own flesh-and-blood? Doesn't that matter?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not to me, right now. I imagine it will eventually. Also, this is a small picture into my decision-making about many things. Imagine what it's like for Kristi, putting up with this all day long...</p>

<h3 id="the-market-for-liberty">The Market for Liberty</h3>
<p>Sigh. Here marks my transition "Libertarian" to "certified tin-foil-hat-wearing anarchist". I didn't even like the book, but there was one key point in the book that I couldn't shake.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A laissez-faire society is not a Utopia in which the initiation of violence is impossible. Rather, it is a society which does not <em>institutionalize</em> the initiation of force and in which there are means for dealing with aggression justly when it does occur.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, what system has a monopoly on the lawful initiation of force, and which also institutionalizes bad actors inside that system?</p>
<p>The government.</p>
<p>This ties into some other themes that have been growing in my head for a few years. Tinkering around the edges of a system that institutionalizes the initiation of force, and is able to coerce it's own survival on the backs of those who serve it... is a luxury, since it's steamrolling over the lives of many others.</p>
<p>Related: the last book that made me cry while reading it: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17834926-negroes-and-the-gun?ac=1&amp;from_search=true">Negroes and the Gun: The Black Tradition of Arms</a>. Spoiler: The government simultaneously claimed to act in the interests of it's citizens as it hunted down and destroyed innocent-but-marginalized people.</p>

<h3 id="deep-work">Deep Work</h3>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://josh.works/i-quit">I quit</a> after reading <em>Deep Work</em>. I started wearing a wrist-watch, and I now work in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoros</a>. As I track how much work I do, I mostly just track how many Pomororo's I've accomplished in a given day.</p>
<p>I'm still slowly remaking how I work and my daily routine in response to <em>Deep Work</em>.</p>
<p>No other book that I've read this year has impacted my day to day as <em>Deep Work</em> by Cal Newport.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted-ebook/dp/B00X47ZVXM/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1484174924&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=deep+work">Deep Work on Amazon</a></p>
<h3 id="life-together">Life Together</h3>
<p>Life Together is about Christians living in community. This exact topic has been plaguing me for the better part of two years, and <em>Life Together</em> brought a lot of hope and clarity to me.</p>
<p>I've struggled with the notion of "Christian community" because I get so frustrated by much of what happens in churches, or is done on my behalf by "the church" (as defined by old white conservatives from America).</p>
<p>I struggle to sit under the biblical authority of people who's politics seem decidedly anti-christ-like. The temptation is to just walk away and try to carve out some little "church of Thompson", and pretend like that is sufficient and Christ-honoring, but it isn't.</p>
<p><em>Life Together</em> was convicting, and is driving change in my daily routines. I'm going to re-read it soon and make another "wave" of changes, but the most encouraging thing was how much Bohhoeffer celebrates the virtue of keeping one's mouth shut:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bonhoeffer's Decisive Rule of Christian Fellowship: Every individual is prohibited from saying much of what occurs to him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, I can celebrate the minor victories of keeping my mouth shut, most of the time.</p>
<p>More on this topic another time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Life-Together-Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-ebook/dp/B005MJ2RPK/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1484175478&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=life+together">Amazon: Life Together</a></p>
<h3 id="80-000-hours">80,000 Hours</h3>
<p>40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year, 40 years. That's about 80,000 hours of work. How are you going to spend it?</p>
<p>This book <em>isn't</em> driving change in my life right now, but it meshes perfectly with my already-heretical notions about what it means to "do good work for others".</p>
<p>I.E. Do you want to have a big impact on the world? Don't become a doctor, at least if you plan on working in America. The marginal societal return of an additional doctor is tiny compared to that same doctor in a poor country, or compared to plenty of other career paths available to someone today.</p>
<p>Don't go work for a non-profit, either.</p>
<p>The theme is "effective altruism", and they handle job/career advice better than most. FWIW, they're big fans of Cal Newport's <em>Deep Work</em> philosophy.</p>

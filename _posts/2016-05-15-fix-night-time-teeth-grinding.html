<p>A few years ago, I found out I grind me teeth at night.</p>
<p>Kristi says it sounds like I'm chewing marbles.</p>
<p>Others who grind their teeth give themselves headaches, or wake themselves up at night.</p>
<p>You can't really stop yourself from grinding your teeth, since you're asleep.</p>
<p>You <em>can</em> stop chewing gum, and try to be less stressed, but the go-too solution for teeth-grinders is a mouth guard.</p>
<p>Custom mouth guards are expensive and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Over the counter mouth guards fall into two categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bulky mouth guards that you soak in boiling water and then fit to your teeth. I tried two of these, and found them to not be that comfortable, AND I bit through BOTH of them after a week or two. Whoa.</li>
<li>Low profile mouth guards that are basically like magic. I use the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Plackers-Mouth-Guard-Grind-Night/dp/B004TD23W2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8">Plackers Mouth Guard Grind No More</a>* exclusively now. Supposedly they are disposable, but I use them for a few months at a time. They have very little texture, so they're easy to clean/don't get smelly, and they're small and flexible, so they take up very little space in a toiletry kit.Â </li>
</ol>
<p>And, as a bonus, they are comfortable, and don't impede my talking.</p>
<p>They're cheap as dirt (you can buy them one-at-a-time in a pharmacy, for $1.20 or so), and if you try them and <em>don't</em> like them, you've lost nothing.</p>

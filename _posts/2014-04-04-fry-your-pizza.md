Here's a problem many of us first-worlders have: cold pizza.

There are two options. Microwave it, or throw it in the toaster oven or regular oven. A microwave makes it soggy, and a regular oven takes forever to heat it up.

(If you're willing to eat it cold, may god have mercy on your soul.)

Well, there's a solution to this problem. Here's how it works.

* Before you get your pizza out of the microwave, throw your skillet on the burner, medium heat.
* Microwave your pizza for 45 seconds or so, until it's warm.

### This is the important part

* Place your pizza on the skillet
* Cook it until it's crispy on the bottom

This process is very quick. If you're lucky enough to have a gas range, it will add about two minutes to your 45 seconds of microwave time. If you're forced to work with a regular electric oven, it'll take a while to get the skillet hot. Sorry.

Guess what I had for dinner?

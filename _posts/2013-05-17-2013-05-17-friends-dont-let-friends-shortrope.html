<p><em>The first in a series about how to <a href="/blog/2013/05/12/how-to-be-an-awesome-belayer" title="How to be an awesomeÂ belayer">be a better belayer.</a></em>
<strong>Short rope</strong> [shawrt-rohp] <em>verb<strong>: </strong></em>The act of not giving sufficient rope to your climber.</p>
<p>Getting short roped is bad. It's not necessarily dangerous, nor does it cause you to take a whip (it can, of course) but the real reason it's bad is because it convinces your subconscious that you're climbing with an untrustworthy belayer. The reasoning is simple - if you're getting short roped, your belayer is either not paying attention, or not technically proficient. It's not just annoying, it's counter-productive.<!--more--></p>
<p>It would be unwise to push yourself when climbing with an inattentive or unskilled belayer.</p>
<p>The good news is this: if your belayer actually <em>wants</em> to stop short roping you, there is an easy fix. (If your belayer doesn't care about short roping you, stop climbing with them. Seriously.)</p>
<p>First, when the climber is clipping, <strong>the belayer should step in towards the first bolt as they feed out slack</strong>. This simple action resolves most instances of short roping.</p>
<p>Second, when the climber is clipping, <strong>the belayer needs to feed out a full arm length of slack without coming out of the break position.
</strong></p>
<p>I tried to explain both of these concepts in-depth using words, and kept coming up short, so I am going to make a short video demonstrating both, and why they make such a big difference in safety and convenience for your climber. I tried filming with the camera on my laptop, but it was all fuzzy. Stay tuned!</p>
<p><em>I would <strong>love</strong> feedback and questions. Seriously. I love answering questions.</em></p>

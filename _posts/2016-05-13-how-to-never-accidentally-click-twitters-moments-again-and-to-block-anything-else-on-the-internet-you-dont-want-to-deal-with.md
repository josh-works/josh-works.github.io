Do you use Twitter's "Moments" tool, or do you just find it really annoying?



Most people find it annoying. Here's how to get rid of Twitter's "Moments" forever:



**0. Be won over to using an ad blocker on the internet.**

They don't block just ads, but malicious scripts and bandwidth-hogging junk. I'm a huge fan, 
[so is Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/5649025/why-you-should-use-adblock-plus-even-if-you-dont-block-ads). 
[Others are not](http://thisinterestsme.com/adblock-bad-thing-people-use-selfish/) 



**1. Install uBlock Origin.**

Here's links for 
[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm/reviews?hl=en), 
[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/), and... the jury is still out for a good ad blocker for Safari.


Already using AdBlock Plus? "uBlock is lighter/quicker than ABP" - 
[Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/ublock-is-a-fast-and-lightweight-alternative-to-adblock-1625246461)

(There's a big kerfuffle about uBlock vs. uBlock Origin. I just 
[trust the internet](https://www.reddit.com/r/ublock/comments/32mos6/ublock_vs_ublock_origin/) and went with uBlock Origin.)


**2. Click the uBlock icon, and click the eye dropper tool.**

The tool label is "Enter Element picker mode"



**3.**
**Move the element picker to the 
entire "Moments" section.**

(Not just the text or the icon)



**4. Click it (or any section of the page you want to hide)**

You know you want to. You won't break anything. Once you click it - the thing you clicked? It's GONE!



**5. On the tooltip that pops up in the bottom right of your screen, mouse over it, and click "create"**



Here's a gif of using uBlock:

If you make a mistake, no sweat. Right click on the uBlock icon>options>my filters>delete the rule you don't want>apply changes

Done! Never get frustrated clicking into "Moments" again!



You can use it elsewhere, too.



For example, email "subscribe now" popups can get annoying.



I've subscribed to a newsletter (
[Kopywriting Kourse](http://kopywritingkourse.com/blog/), if you must know), and when I click a link in the emails I receive, I get more popups asking me to join the newsletter! So, I use uBlock to permanently hide the popup:

That's all. Hopefully this is useful!



PS: The controversy about ad blockers makes me think about advertising as a huge mis-allocation of resources for modern man. I'll expand on this some day.

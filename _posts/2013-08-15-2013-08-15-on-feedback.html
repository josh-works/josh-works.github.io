<p>Most of what makes us who we are is based on some sort of feedback obtained earlier in our life.
By my best estimation, there are two types of feedback:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Explicit feedback</strong>, which comes in a little box labeled "this is feedback", and is hard to miss.</li>
<li>
<strong>Implicit feedback</strong>, which is unlabeled, and but for your attention to it, goes unnoticed.</li>
</ol>
<p>By my age (mid-20s) most of my life has been guided by explicit feedback. As a baby, I was rewarded for doing things like crawling and disciplined when I tried to lick power outlets; as a young child I was rewarded for doing what I was told to do, and disciplined when I didn't. As a student, I was rewarded with good grades when I did what I was told ("Learn this material in such a fashion that you can regurgitate it on a test with unique but similarly structured questions.") or when I synthesized old ideas in old ways ("Make an assertion, defend it using intelligible thought and a passing understanding of the English language. No less than twelve pages.")</p>
<p><strong>Jobs come laden with explicit feedback.</strong> Being given a job usually comes with explicit feedback: "we are happy to bring you on board because of X, Y, and Z, and we think you're a good fit for the role." Ditto with raises, promotions, and "employee of the month" awards. More explicit feedback is available in the form of reprimands, and of course, being fired.</p>
<p><strong>Relationships have explicit feedback.</strong> Someone verbally agreeing to be your friend or (in the case of my wife) agreeing to marry me is providing explicit. When they say "I hate it when [x]" or "I love [Y]", this is explicit feedback. They are verbalizing their feelings.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about all this, though, is<strong> </strong>this: <strong>implicit feedback can lead to so much growth.Â </strong>So much more growth than explicit feedback. If you are sensitive to others around you and have a sincere desire to learn, you can figure out how to kick butt at work, or in a relationship, or a lot of other things. Implicit feedback allows you to <em>infer</em> what is going on under the surface.</p>
<p>There are a lot of areas this applies to. Relationships, jobs, friendships, self-monitoring... I've hardly thought of them all.</p>
<p>If you apply this method to all areas of your life, I think the results could be quite interesting. This is an idea that has been rolling around in my head for a few days, and I want to keep fleshing out. There are some specific situations that this applies to me, and I'll talk more about that soon.</p>
<p>Your feedback is welcome! (pah. of course it is.): In what areas do you wish you had more feedback in? In those areas, could you possibly be more attuned to implicit feedback?</p>

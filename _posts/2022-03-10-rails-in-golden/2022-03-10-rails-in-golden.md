I was describing this two or three stage plan to a friend the other day. They _almsot_ understood it, but since they don't live in Golden, and have not spent a lot of their life nerding out on "urban mobility infrastructure", they didn't quite get it.

Since I'm trying to [write things quickly, or at least now]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2021-10-05-write-it-now.md %}), I'm doing a quick little visual of what I wanted to propose to the involved parties.

## The involved parties

I think there are three institutions that, if working together in interesting ways, could build a very interesting piece of infrastructure.

School of Mines could create a streetcar/urban-mobility-infrastructure school, and start getting students involved with (and, as soon as possible, in charge of) planning, designing, building, and operating a growing streetcar network.

The steps:

## Step 1

Coors takes the lead on getting rail line installed, all the way to what will be a train-building/street-car-testing facility on School of Mines campus, and an initial 'transfer equipment to a smaller device' facility will be built at the junction of the existing rail line and the new streetcar line:

## Step 2

Now to start getting the street car network sorta "mixed into" school of mines space:

Here's some ideas of where some new lines might be added:

## Step 3

If step 2 looked impossibly huge to you, and like 10x what seems reasonable, I get it. Lets actually dramatically shrink step 2, and instead get Mines to treat it's entire campus as a bit of a laboratory for this streetcar thing, learning how to operate it, put them up for the night, get them ready for the day, run them, etc.

Maybe Mines will figure out how to make autonomous streetcars, similar to the autonomous busses it drives around. I bet someone there could.

Here's a much smaller version of building some rail. Obviously these are just ideas, but hopefully you can start seeing how this could lead to a growing body of knowledge and understanding.

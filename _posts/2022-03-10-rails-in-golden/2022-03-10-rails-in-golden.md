I was describing this two or three stage plan to a friend the other day. They _almsot_ understood it, but since they don't live in Golden, and have not spent a lot of their life nerding out on "urban mobility infrastructure", they didn't quite get it.

Since I'm trying to [write things quickly, or at least now]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2021-10-05-write-it-now.md %}), I'm doing a quick little visual of what I wanted to propose to the involved parties.

## The involved parties

I think there are three institutions that, if working together in interesting ways, could build a very interesting piece of infrastructure.

School of Mines could create a streetcar/urban-mobility-infrastructure school, and start getting students involved with (and, as soon as possible, in charge of) planning, designing, building, and operating a growing streetcar network.

The steps. None of these are small steps, but are within the capacities of one or two people to manage each of the primary constituent steps, and the on-the-ground-help of no more than a dozen workers at a single time.

## Step 1

Coors takes the lead on getting rail line installed, all the way to what will be a train-building/street-car-testing facility on School of Mines campus, and an initial 'transfer equipment to a smaller device' facility will be built at the junction of the existing rail line and the new streetcar line:

sub-tasks:

- start pricing/buying narrow-guage railway. I have a friend that was the #1 steel-seller in colorado, he'll get us where we need to go

Narrow-guage, because (from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow-gauge_railway)):

> Since narrow-gauge railways are usually built with tighter curves, smaller structure gauges, and lighter rails, they can be less costly to build, equip, and operate than standard- or broad-gauge railways (particularly in mountainous or difficult terrain).[1] Lower-cost narrow-gauge railways are often used in mountainous terrain, where engineering savings can be substantial. Lower-cost narrow-gauge railways are often built to serve industries as well as sparsely populated communities where the traffic potential would not justify the cost of a standard- or broad-gauge line. Narrow-gauge railways have specialised use in mines and other environments where a small structure gauge necessitates a small loading gauge. 

while the steel is shipping, start the streetcar staging depot:

- Build a shed that covers the beginning of the rail, and has space on one side of the track for assembling train parts
- the shed/production facility doesn't need to be very tall, but it needs to be equipped with moveable winches that can move heavy things from the tracks and back


## Step 2

Now to start getting the street car network sorta "mixed into" school of mines space:

Here's some ideas of where some new lines might be added:

## Step 3

If step 2 looked impossibly huge to you, and like 10x what seems reasonable, I get it. Lets actually dramatically shrink step 2, and instead get Mines to treat it's entire campus as a bit of a laboratory for this streetcar thing, learning how to operate it, put them up for the night, get them ready for the day, run them, etc.

Maybe Mines will figure out how to make autonomous streetcars, similar to the autonomous busses it drives around. I bet someone there could.

Here's a much smaller version of building some rail. Obviously these are just ideas, but hopefully you can start seeing how this could lead to a growing body of knowledge and understanding.

# Questions

- what is the correct increment/size of rail line one buys? I imagine it's a certain quantity of steel in a given [track gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow-gauge_railway).
- I imagine

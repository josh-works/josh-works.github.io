## What Is "Jaywalking"

To 'jaywalk' would be to cross into or across a street, outside of a 'signalized intersection', outside of an 'appropriate time'. If you're white-passing, and perceivably not of the lowest economic class, you're vanishingly unlikely to ever hear from a 'law enforcement officer' a breath about 'jaywalking enforcement'.

If you're a person of the global majority, or perceivably poor, you're vastly more likely to have an encounter with violence-dealing coercive thugs. 


"Jaywalking" is a propagandist slur that supports the norms of the oppressor class. It is a slur, castigating both an economic and social norm, created by the auto industry in conjunction with white politically powerful government officials to solve a problem the car industry was facing - their products kept causing people to die, and were at risk of getting banned in cities!

The innovation of jaywalking was a huge step forward for american policing.

Here's how to view "laws" and "claims of authority":

> Laws are threats made by the dominant socioeconomic-ethnic group in a given nation. It's just the promise of violence that's enacted and the police are basically an occupying army.

Because American Police got their start as "deputizing the slave patrols", jaywalking gave another HUGE realm for social control. Now police could justify assaulting someone as 'enforcing jaywalking laws'. 

> In 1991, two police officers stopped Tupac Shakur for jaywalking. He said he was knocked unconscious during his arrest, and sued the city of Oakland for 10 million dollars [he ultimately got a few thousand dollars, a total slap in the face]. His lawyer says many of the police brutality cases he’s worked on started with jaywalking stops.

## What Wikipedia Says Jaywalking Is

Here's how Wikipedia recounts the story:

[Jaywalking (wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaywalking) 

> Jaywalking is the act of pedestrians walking in or crossing a roadway if that act contravenes traffic regulations. The term originated in the United States as a derivation of the phrase jay-drivers (the word jay meaning 'a greenhorn, or rube'), people who drove horse-drawn carriages and automobiles on the wrong side of the road, before taking its current meaning. 
> 
> Jaywalking was coined as the automobile arrived in the street in the context of the conflict between pedestrian and automobiles (also then known as horseless carriages), more specifically the nascent automobile industry.
> 
> Jaywalking laws vary widely by jurisdiction. In many countries such as the United Kingdom, the word is not generally used and, with the exception of certain high-speed roads, there are no laws limiting how pedestrians can use public highways. This has caused confusion among British people visiting countries with less freedom, with the BBC reporting on a case where a man from the UK was arrested in the U.S. city of Atlanta for crossing the road.
> 
> Automobile interests in the US took up the cause of labeling and scorning jaywalkers in the 1910s and early 1920s. In 1912, for instance, _Popular Mechanics_ magazine reported that the term was current in Kansas City: 
>> The city pedestrian who cares not for traffic regulations at street corners, but strays all over the street, crossing in the middle of the block, or attempting to save time by choosing a diagonal route across a street intersection instead of adhering to the regular crossing, is designated as a "jay walker," in Kansas City.
> 
> The earliest citation in the Oxford English Dictionary dates to 1917. The word was promoted by pro-automobile interests in the 1920s, according to historian and alternative transportation advocate Peter D. Norton. Today, in the US, the word is often used synonymously with its current legal definition, crossing the street illegally.
> 
> Originally in the US, the legal rule was that "all persons have an equal right in the highway, and that in exercising the right each shall take due care not to injure other users of the way". In time, however, streets became the province of vehicular traffic, both practically and legally.

American traffic planners, if they had an ethical bone in their body, would see 'jaywalking' as an environmental sign that better infrastructure is needed to meet the needs of a group of people moving about a geography, safely and smoothly. Jaywalking is more akin to [desire paths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path) than a crime, unless you want to maintain social control over certain people with violence.

Roads in America are built as often to accomplish the goal of _walls_ as anything else. So a Jaywalking law says something like the following, to people of the global majority: 

> please respect our intent of placing a wall across this community/neighborhood/junction, and if you don't we'll ruin your life.

Maybe I'll do a follow-up post on how to recognize in the environment that a wall was built for a road, and upgraded repeatedly to better accomplish the goals of severing a community. It's screamingly obvious, once you know what to look for. City engineers cannot be held responsible for the deaths they oversee and bring about, and this is unforgivable. An abuse that deserves open condemnation and ridicule and contempt for as long as it's in place.

## Anarchist Calisthenics as the Antidote to Jaywalking Propaganda

This is a hot take, perhaps. 

'law and order' is the rallying cry of the oppressor class. Remember that quote:

> Laws are threats made by the dominant socioeconomic-ethnic group in a given nation. It's just the promise of violence that's enacted and the police are basically an occupying army.

Next, 'laws' have also been the guise under which some of the worst atrocities known to humans have been committed, so... it would behoove us all to flex the muscles of 'breaking laws', which is just a propagandist phrase anyway.

The solution to jaywalking as an idea is to exercise [anarchist calisthenics](https://harpers.org/archive/2012/12/anarchist-calisthenics/) and jaywalk, yourself, and enlist friends and others in your scheme as often as possible. From Scott's piece:

> Twice, perhaps, in the course of roughly five hours of my observing this scene, did a pedestrian cross against the light, and then always to a chorus of scolding tongues and fingers wagging in disapproval. I, too, became part of the scene. If I had mangled my last exchange in German, sapping my confidence, I stood there with the rest for as long as it took for the light to change, afraid to brave the glares that awaited me if I crossed. If, more rarely, my last exchange in German had gone well and my confidence was high, I would cross against the light, thinking, to buck up my courage, that it was stupid to obey a minor law that, in this case, was so contrary to reason.
> 
> It surprised me how much I had to screw up my courage merely to cross a street against general disapproval. How little my rational convictions seemed to weigh beside their scolding. Striding out boldly into the intersection made a more striking impression, perhaps, but it required more courage than I could normally muster.

An ethical read of streets says they're available to everyone, and just because you're not currently in a car doesn't mean you need to give enormous emotional deference to the presence of a vehicle. 

Please do read [Anarchist Calisthenics](https://harpers.org/archive/2012/12/anarchist-calisthenics/) by James C Scott. It's a short article.

The place you're most likely to be struck (and killed!) by a vehicle, while crossing roads outside of a four-wheeled vehicle, is _while using pedestrian infrastructure_, _while crossing at an 'approved' time_. Car drivers are sometimes not paying close attention, or they drive like supremacists, or the sight lines are atrocious, and it's extremely common for right-turning cars to run over pedestrians who are crossing the road.

The 'pillar' of the windshield is often obstructing the driver's view of where pedestrians might be standing, and when drivers are trying to slide into gaps in traffic, they often do not scan conflict areas with their eyes.

It's vastly safer (in america) to cross a road outside of the established times/places, because you can see/thread gaps in traffic, as needed. If American 'traffic planners' or 'city engineers' or 'municipal planners' were not hell-bent on maintaining oppressive systems set up by actual white supremacists, American roads could be rendered safe in about two weeks.[^bollards]

[^bollards]: A skid steer + well-shaped rocks, serving as [bollards]({{ site.baseurl  }}{% link _posts/2024-04-30-bollards.md %}), large enough for an adult to sit on, obtained for functionally free, could neck down every road that has more than one lane in a given direction into a one-lane-each-way road. For all junctions, a would convert from from lights/stop-signs to roundabouts, shaped by rocks and bollards, with a target max speed in a city of no more than 30mph and a target min speed of 4 mph. everything would be fixed. "but car drivers would be surprised" says every traffic engineer and police officer I've spoken to about it. me: "behold, my field of f*cks, you can see that it is barren!"


## My Jaywalking Exploits

If you and I go on a walk together, we're jaywalking as we're walking around, and I'll explain all of this (again) to you. 

The legal regime of America is 'just' the wet-dream of settler colonialists trying to implement regimes of social control on the colonized populations. Lets not extend dignity or respect to a regime such as this.

Colefax, near Park Ave, in Denver, is atrocious. Cars regularly go 50-60 mph, and vast swaths of it have zero lights or crosswalks or even center signs or cones to separate the lanes going in opposite directions.

There's a donut shop right across from my house, with no pedestrian crossing, so I 'jaywalk' across the street all the time, and when I go to Cheesman Park or the Botanic Gardens. Here's what some of my activity data looks like. This isn't all just walking, most of the activity is technically me on my scooter. Maybe I'll color the trips by type:

The green boxes show where there is zero road-crossing infrastructure:

![park](/images/park.png)

I have open contempt for the kinds of people that exert effort to maintain a bad regime, especially when it's obvious they're simply trying to maintain emotional comfort. I vomit these people out of my mouth, they are not welcome in my home or around those I love. Unfortunately, I have lots of these kinds of people in my direct, immediate family. (I was raised by white supremacists, grew up around a lot of them, I know them intimately)

Yet we live...

A group of armed men who would harrass and emotionally dominate non-whites.

The police go to _great effort_ to make it really clear that _they own no specific duty, to any particular person, to actually protect or to serve that person._ you can see why the marketing is useful, though. If they all said "to abuse and enslave" on the side of their vehicles, that would hit a bit too close to home, even though if you look at how police spend their time, the latter is vastly more common than the former.

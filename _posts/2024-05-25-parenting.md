As many of us are or might be, I "am a parent", or I "have a child", or something like that.

This is complex for me to write and engage with, because something that is _certainly true for all of us_ is that _we_ "have a parent" or we "have been a child". Also the status of 'child' is quite temporary. 

I think the rightest phrase of analysis is "I am responsible for someone who will some day be in many ways a _peer_, who is not yet fully equipped with the same or equivalent sets of tools/skills as I, and I happen to enjoy the company and personality of this peer."

The 'peer' part is not to adultify or parentify a child, but instead to elevate the express the commonality if our shared humanity. 

I am pleased to regularly embody a way-of-being that is quite accommodating to a toddler, and because of the other people who's interactions I now witness, _lots of the natural way of being of adults/western&modern&american adults is quite inhospitable to children._

I'm not quite sure how I'm proceeding through this post, by the way. There will certainly be some book lists and links to articles, as usual. Some of what I want to express is some of the delight that I so regularly experience when sharing time with Eden, partially because _lots of adults act like they actively resent children_, and it is angering and distressing to witness. 

I'm inspired by people like [Robert Heaton](https://robertheaton.com/#parenthood). One of his many posts about his child: [Height: 2ft 10 inches. Occupation: baby](https://robertheaton.com/height-2-10-occupation-baby/).

## Ideas That Play(ed) A Big Role

### Elimination Communication

This was perhaps responsible for _most_ of the early-stage 'this child seems extremely chill' vibes. I'm perhaps trying to cover too much in a single post, sorry.

Western Diaper Culture, esp disposable diapers, is not how it's always been done. Eastern cultures were aware of the rythems of children/infants, built routines of baby-wearing + 'easy' aided waste elimination, so from a young age the person is simply eliminating into the ground or a suitable container _by default_ instead of defaulting into soiled diapers.

This is also the first move of learning to be non-coercive towards children. Observe, study, learn to communicate, use your adult brain/skills to bridge towards their brain and skills. Their skills grow so quickly in healthy environments. 

Baby sign language, and recognizing/helping-into regulated nervous system states. 

### On meeting Eden

Eden loves to meet my friends, and my friends love to meet her. She meets strangers, and interacts with adult, in my company, often. I've seen many different patterns of interactions, and I'd like to speak about some of them.

I barely conceed the use of this language, but it might be legible enough. Often, when a large adult meets her and directs too much emotional energy straight at her, _if she has not interacted with that person or recently or just doesn't feel like it_ she will turn her face away and give the body language of disengagement. I read this as straight-down-the-middle managing someone who's steamrolling her emotionally or socially, and I always help. I'll put myself physically between them, and if I'm holding her I'll turn her away, and I might even also turn away from the speaker, and direct our attention to something else. Not her, not me, but that plant, that person over there, the thing.

#### "Shy" isn't a helpful question or label

Sometimes an adult acts entitled to obtaining a certain reaction from Eden. This is visible to me when they 

Sometimes people ask me "oh, is she shy?", while Eden is with me, pointedly not making eye contact with the question-asker, who perhaps _just_ walked up and has never shared a moment of real interaction with her in the past...

They perhaps think she doesn't understand what they're saying, or isn't able to comprehend our conversation.

I say some version of:

> That framing makes useful conversation less accessible, rather than more. Eden knows that she doesn't 'need' to 'give' anyone any sort of concession, just because someone thinks they're entitled to it, nor does she need to perform for people. It's inappropriate for an adult to demand a certain kind of interaction from a child. 

I usually figure out how to be diplomatic about it, and fortunately 'shy' as a concept is sort of fading out of society, I think.

I'll always add something like:

> And _obviously_ if we don't feel comfortable with someone, we wouldn't just act like they're a highly trusted person because we think it's polite or their feelings won't get hurt. LOL. 

So, sometimes Eden pointedly refuses to even turn her face towards someone. Sometimes the person correctly infers that it's her de-escalating the intensity of the interaction, and they take their own steps to reduce the intensity. Others cannot see it, or refuse to act on it, and instead keep stepping closer and trying to get in her face, to get her to look at them and say hello or something.

I obviously use my adult skills and abilities to advocate on Eden's behalf, and this sort of behavior gets stopped almost immediately, whenever I'm there to witness. 

Eden is also _quite_ happy to stare at a person with what is sometimes called a _withering intensity_ that is so distinctive that complete strangers will comment on it. it's actually the look of someone who's totally focused on what they are looking at, they're not performing 'social softening' of the gaze. She's not learned that she has to, and hopefully she never learns to. 

She's permitted to look at something as hard as she wants, or not at all, and I perceive that some adults are unaccustomed to be looked at in such an evaluator-like, non-apologetic way, by such a young child. And, when she doesn't look at an adult, I can also see some some adults are not sure what to do with it.

I dislike the energy that old white people have, when they insert themselves into me and Eden's day to pronounce that they find her physical form appealing. It's _very_ strange to have grown adults continuously talking about the pleasing physical form of a child. (settler colonialism! Seeing children as possessions!) I can make a gracious 'they are doing the best they can' exoneration, but I don't really feel like it.

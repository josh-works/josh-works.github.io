As many of us are or might be, I "am a parent", or I "have a child", or something like that.

This is complex for me to write and engage with, because something that is _certainly true for all of us_ is that _we_ "have a parent" or we "have been a child". Also the status of 'child' is quite temporary _in society_, and then perhaps less so in different structures.  

I think a helpful frame might be

> I am responsible for someone who will some day be in many ways a _peer_, who is not yet fully equipped with the same or equivalent sets of tools/skills as I, and I happen to enjoy the company and personality of this peer.

The 'peer' part is not to adultify or parentify a child, of course. It's to elevate or express the commonality of some shared humanity, some shared participation in the human experience. 

I am pleased to regularly embody a way-of-being that is quite accommodating and peaceful to a toddler, and because of the other people who's interactions I now witness, and my own lived experience as a child and adult, _lots of the natural way of being of adults/western&modern&american adults is quite inhospitable to children_. 💔❤️‍🩹

I'm not quite sure how I'm proceeding through this post, by the way. There will certainly be some book lists and links to articles, as usual. [Write it now]({{ site.baseurl  }}{% link _posts/2021-10-05-write-it-now.md %}) and such.

I'm inspired by people like [Robert Heaton](https://robertheaton.com/#parenthood). One of his many posts about his child: [Height: 2ft 10 inches. Occupation: baby](https://robertheaton.com/height-2-10-occupation-baby/). Patrick McKenzie's [vibe with his children](https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1788021768084443430), [Simon Sarris](https://x.com/simonsarris/status/1773482070133682496/). [Penelope Trunk](https://blog.penelopetrunk.com/). Certainly many others.


## Books That Have Informed Me

Normal-ish books, but very written from an unselfconscious western perspective. 

[Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids: Why Being a Great Parent Is Less Work and More Fun Than You Think](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/10266902-selfish-reasons-to-have-more-kids): among other things, the author expresses the concept: "the point of kids isn't kids, but to have good relationships with your adult children, because 40 years will pass in that context while maybe 16 will pass in the 'child' context. Mostly kids turn out however they're going to turn out, which is generally fine, so you can take a deep breath, pursue ease, for everyone's benefit." 

Contextualizing some of the idiosyncrasies of living/raising young in/around constraining structures, of which there are many. Even if everything is peaceful and healthy at home, there's a lot to trying to navigate the adult world in a coherent and peaceful way despite pretty obvious intrusive counter-efforts. 

AKA I count these as 'parenting-informing' or 'parenting adjacent' even though they're obviously not a traditional parenting book. 

[Against the Grain: A Deep History of the Earliest States](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34324534-against-the-grain)

A great take on what sort of structures (social and otherwise) existed in the ecosystem as some groups of people were organizing this thing called 'states'. Sorta city-state-ish, in today's parlance. There was a whole lot of acquisition and dependence on behalf of the state, and when the state 'failed' (aka "the person chiseling tables of counts of people, cattle, and grain stopped showing up to work") it mostly looked like the various 'acquired' populations walking out of town back to wherever they'd been acquired from. 

It's a bit of a subversive read. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

[The Secret of Our Success](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25761655-the-secret-of-our-success?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_18)

Hard to summarize myself, so here's [scott alexander's book review](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/04/book-review-the-secret-of-our-success/)

Many western parenting tropes rely quite a bit on coercion and a punishment-informed mindset. When pointed out, a reactionary defense of 'what other options do I have' is sometimes offered up. 

Besides indicating that the speaker has an operating belief in the entitlement to dominate[^entitlement], I earnestly, humbly suggest a self-paced ethno-biographical study of 14 different cultures and legal regimes that operated in specific times and places. One can imagine at least partially enlarging one's array of non-coercive tools for mutuality with others after embarking (willingly) on such a journey.

[^entitlement]: It's worth noting when there's an energy of entitlement operating, because to not name it is to slip into a weaker frame. "What other way do I have of making my child go to school than heaping punishments on them?" belies an _entitlement_. Entitlement sounds like: "it seems appropriate to me to dominate someone in this situation, so I'm simply looking for the easiest-way-for-both-of-us to accomplish that domination. I'm willing to do a light touch if they make it easy enough." 

This book is [Legal Systems Very Different from Ours](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/30066446). [Also available for free, chapter by chapter, on the author's website](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Legal%20Systems/LegalSystemsContents.htm)[^publish].

[^publish]: Would you believe the author uses different 'intellectual property' norms than the american publishing system?



## Ideas That Play(ed) A Big Role

### Tacit knowledge exists

[Why Tacit Knowledge is More Important Than Deliberate Practice](https://commoncog.com/tacit-knowledge-is-a-real-thing/)

I cannot express the various ways these ideas have slipped into my life, the ideas of tacit knowledge, and [Reality has a surprising amount of detail](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail). It makes me usually fun to go on walks with, even at the speed of a toddler. 

I wrote more about it introducing an experimental 'learn-along' series: [intro to a series on an open-source contribution, intermediateruby.com](https://www.intermediateruby.com/make-oss-contributions-part-0-introduction)

I [find interestingness everywhere]({{ site.baseurl  }}{% link _posts/2021-02-18-driven-by-compression-progress.md %}), it's a useful foundation for constructing a 'bridge' towards someone or a place, in empathy or skill. 

### Elimination Communication

This was perhaps responsible for _most_ of the early-stage 'this child seems extremely chill' vibes. I'm perhaps trying to cover too much in a single post, sorry.

Western diaper culture, esp disposable diapers, is not how it's always been done. Eastern cultures were aware of the rythems of children/infants, built routines of baby-wearing + 'easy' aided waste elimination, so from a young age the person is simply eliminating into the ground or a suitable container _by default_ instead of defaulting into soiled diapers.

This is also the first move of learning to be non-coercive towards children. Observe, study, learn to communicate, use your adult brain/skills to bridge towards their brain and skills. Their skills grow so quickly in healthy environments. 

Baby sign language, and recognizing/helping-into regulated nervous system states. 



## On people meeting

Eden loves to meet my friends, in her words, and my friends love to meet her (theirs). She meets strangers, and interacts with adults, in my company, regularly. I've seen many different patterns of interactions, and I'd like to speak about some of them.

I barely concede the use of this language, but it might be legible enough. 

Often, when a large adult meets her and directs too much emotional energy straight at her, _especially if she has not interacted with that person or recently or just doesn't feel like it_ she will turn her face away and give the body language of disengagement. 

It's plainly visible to me, it's easily namable by both of us, before and/or after, and of course I always help. I've got skills and capacities and status that she doesn't, so it's easy-enough for me to manage, even if I resent that I have to 'manage' something like this at all.

I'll put myself physically between them, more than she's already done, and if I'm holding her I'll turn her away, and I might even also turn away from the speaker, and direct our attention to something else. 

Not her, not me, but that plant, that person over there, the thing. A step to the side/away also might happen. At least once or twice, an adult still changes their location, elevation, tone of voice, and content of discussion from what seems conventional, and sort of swoop in again to try to, quite literally, 'get in her face', but with a certain expectant energy. 

To pick from one of several available frames, it's a little bit of a projection of a role onto someone, while that same person steps into their own projection of their own role. 

> This is a child, a girl, who must like girly things and be feminine and childish and incapable and sub-consciousness, and I am used to eliciting a certain reaction, and that makes me feel good/safe/in control/dominant, which i like.

It's usually a pretty namable energy, every/anyone can see it, Eden will name it to me, sometimes before or after. "I didn't like that person", she might say, or other things like it. 

A nice alternative energy is something more akin to:

1. allowing non-demanding emotional engagement to extend in her direction, in an 'opt in' kind of way. 
2. keep most of the energy and focus on whatever is normal, which is usually some mix of whatever you were up to 30 seconds ago, or engaging with me, or participating in the flow of whatever is going on. 


## on scripts

The kinds of people who script social interactions and believe they're entitled to verbal engagement from someone tend to say things like:

- "say please/thank you"
- "say [...]"
- "say i love you"

I've often-enough/too-often informed others of a norm for interacting with eden: 

> we do not put words in edens mouth, or demand her to place our words in her mouth.

To the credit of many, i perceive this norm to have been well received.

## "Shy" isn't a helpful question or label

Sometimes an adult acts entitled to obtaining a certain reaction from Eden. 

Sometimes people ask me "oh, is she shy?", while Eden is with me, pointedly not making eye contact with the question-asker, who perhaps _just_ walked up and has never shared a moment of real interaction with her in the past...

They perhaps think she doesn't understand what they're saying, or isn't able to comprehend our conversation.

I say some version of:

> That framing makes useful conversation less accessible, rather than more. Eden knows that she doesn't 'need' to 'give' anyone any sort of concession, just because someone thinks they're entitled to it, nor does she need to perform for people. It's inappropriate for an adult to demand a certain kind of interaction from a child. 

I usually figure out how to be diplomatic about it, and fortunately 'shy' as a concept is sort of fading out of society, I think.

I'll always add something like:

> And _obviously_ if we don't feel comfortable with someone, we wouldn't try to act like they're a trusted person because they believe in politeness, or their feelings might get hurt. 

So, sometimes Eden pointedly refuses to even turn her face towards someone. Sometimes the person correctly infers that it's her de-escalating the intensity of the interaction, and they take their own steps to reduce the intensity, instantly and perhaps even subconsciously. 

Others cannot see it, or refuse to act on it, and instead keep stepping closer and trying to get in her face, to get her to look at them and say hello or something. Or to say "thank you" as they make an evaluation of some aspect of her physical appearance. 

broadly, it's possibly appropriate to comment on thinking someone made distinctive choices in picking out an item of clothing or displayed prowess in judgment or skill. "sick rainbow shoes.", "that thing you did looked tricky, and skillful." Does anything _need_ to be said.

I obviously use my adult skills and abilities to advocate on Eden's behalf, and this sort of behavior gets stopped almost immediately, whenever I'm there to witness. 

Eden is also _quite_ happy to stare at a something with intense focus. Sometimes it's a dog, or a bug, or a person. If the person is close enough, and notices, and feels self-conscious, they might call it a _withering intensity_. It's distinctive enough that complete strangers often commented on it, even at a really young age. I proffer it's maybe the look of someone who's totally focused on what they are looking at, they're not performing 'social softening' of the gaze. As a toddler, she'll turn her head to look at something as it or she passes by, in a way that is identical to when she was an infant, and I presume is motivated out of a similar-enough inner state.

She's permitted to look at something as hard as she wants, or not at all, and I perceive that some adults are unaccustomed to be looked at in such an evaluator-like, non-apologetic way, by such a young child. And, when she doesn't look at an adult, I can also see some some adults are not sure what to do with it.

## On Beauty

I dislike the energy that old white people have, when they insert themselves into me and Eden's day to pronounce that they find her physical form appealing. It's _very_ strange to have grown adults continuously talking about the pleasing physical form of a child. (settler colonialism! Seeing children as possessions/nationalism) 

Sometimes it's very visible that an interlocutor has an internal values system that is coherent with white/american/western/racialized beauty norms, and that they see in Eden an attribute that seems coherent with their norms, it feels like they're playing a role in supporting those beauty norms. Taking anyone seriously necessitates at least being able to refrain from stating objectifying statements, or trying to. 

This feels insanely delicate to write even a few paragraphs about. I want to throw a bunch of books out that talk about 'whiteness' or 'supremacy thinking'. There's a few energies still bandying about today rooted in the beliefs that supported chattel slavery, genocide, that sort of thing. 

- [Fearing the Black Body](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42129163-fearing-the-black-body)
- [The History of White People](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6919721-the-history-of-white-people)
- [The Origins of Proslavery Christianity: White and Black Evangelicals in Colonial and Antebellum Virginia](https://www.amazon.com/Origins-Proslavery-Christianity-Evangelicals-Antebellum/dp/0807858773)
- [They Were Her Property](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40887375-they-were-her-property)

It feels vastly under-appreciated in 'normal' society how total of a regime of social control chattel slavery represented, and how fundamentally and totally the dehumanization that occurred affected the mind of the oppressor, the consciousness of the classes and races, that "it" sorta created. 

It's manifestly obvious when at least some streams of it reach out to touch Eden, and I don't like it.

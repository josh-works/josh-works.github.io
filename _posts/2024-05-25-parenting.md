As some of us are or might be, I "am a parent", or I "have a child", or something like that.

This is complex for me to write and engage with, because something that is _certainly true for all of us_ is that we "have a parent" or we "have been a child". To talk about any of it is to talk about all of it. 

Also the status of 'child' is quite temporary _in society_, and then perhaps less so in different structures. Also, to be a child in America is to be a member of an oppressed class. I entirely oppose the energy

I think a helpful frame might be

> I am responsible for someone who will some day be in many ways a _peer_, who is not yet fully equipped with the same or equivalent sets of tools/skills as I, and I happen to enjoy the company and personality of this peer.

The 'peer' part is not to adultify or parentify a child, of course. It's to elevate or express the commonality of some shared humanity, some shared participation in the human experience. 

I am pleased to regularly embody a way-of-being that is quite accommodating and peaceful to a toddler, and because of the other people who's interactions I now witness, and my own lived experience as a child and adult, _lots of the natural way of being of adults/western&modern&american adults is quite inhospitable to children_. 💔❤️‍🩹

I'm not quite sure how I'm proceeding through this post, by the way. There will certainly be some book lists and links to articles, as usual. [Write it now]({{ site.baseurl  }}{% link _posts/2021-10-05-write-it-now.md %}) and such.

I'm inspired by people like [Robert Heaton](https://robertheaton.com/#parenthood). One of his many posts about his child: [Height: 2ft 10 inches.

Hard to summarize myself, so here's [scott alexander's book review](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/04/book-review-the-secret-of-our-success/)

Many western parenting tropes rely quite a bit on coercion and a punishment-informed mindset. When pointed out, a reactionary defense of 'what other options do I have' is sometimes offered up. 

Besides indicating that the speaker has an operating belief in the entitlement to dominate[^entitlement], I earnestly, humbly suggest a self-paced ethno-biographical study of 14 different cultures and legal regimes that operated in specific times and places. One can imagine at least partially enlarging one's array of non-coercive tools for mutuality with others after embarking (willingly) on such a journey.

[^entitlement]: It's worth noting when there's an energy of entitlement operating, because to not name it is to slip into a weaker frame. "What other way do I have of making my child go to school than heaping punishments on them?" belies an _entitlement_. Entitlement sounds like: "it seems appropriate to me to dominate someone in this situation, so I'm simply looking for the easiest-way-for-both-of-us to accomplish that domination. I'm willing to do a light touch if they make it easy enough." 

    This book is [Legal Systems Very Different from Ours](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/30066446). [Also available for free, chapter by chapter, on the author's website](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Legal%20Systems/LegalSystemsContents.htm)[^publish].

[^publish]: Would you believe the author uses different 'intellectual property' norms than the american publishing system?


### Elimination Communication

This was perhaps responsible for _most_ of the early-stage 'this child seems extremely chill' vibes. I'm perhaps trying to cover too much in a single post, sorry.

Western diaper culture, esp disposable diapers, is not how it's always been done. Eastern cultures were aware of the rhythms of children/infants, built routines of baby-wearing + 'easy' aided waste elimination, so from a young age the person is simply eliminating into the ground or a suitable container _by default_ instead of defaulting into soiled diapers.

This is also the first move of learning to be non-coercive towards children. Observe, study, learn to communicate, use your adult brain/skills to bridge towards their brain and skills. Their skills grow so quickly in healthy environments.

## On people meeting

Eden loves to meet my friends, in her words, and my friends love to meet her (theirs). She meets strangers, and interacts with adults, in my company, regularly. I've seen many different patterns of interactions, and I'd like to speak about some of them.

I barely concede the use of this language, but it might be legible enough. 

Often, when a large adult meets her and directs too much emotional energy straight at her, _especially if she has not interacted with that person or recently or just doesn't feel like it_ she will turn her face away and give the body language of disengagement. 

It's plainly visible to me, it's easily namable by both of us, before and/or after, and of course I always help. I've got skills and capacities and status that she doesn't, so it's easy-enough for me to manage, even if I resent that I have to 'manage' something like this at all.

I'll put myself physically between them, more than she's already done, and if I'm holding her I'll turn her away, and I might even also turn away from the speaker, and direct our attention to something else. 

Not her, not me, but that plant, that person over there, the thing. A step to the side/away also might happen. At least once or twice, an adult still changes their location, elevation, tone of voice, and content of discussion from what seems conventional, and sort of swoop in again to try to, quite literally, 'get in her face', but with a certain expectant energy. 

To pick from one of several available frames, it's a little bit of a projection of a role onto someone, while that same person steps into their own projection of their own role. 

Eden feels the projection of the role, and doesn't like it. It's usually a pretty namable energy, every/anyone can see it, Eden will name it to me, sometimes before or after. "I didn't like that person", she might say, or other things like it. 

A nice alternative energy is something more akin to:

1. allowing non-demanding emotional engagement to extend in her direction, in an 'opt in' kind of way. 
2. keep most of the energy and focus on whatever is normal, which is usually some mix of whatever you were up to 30 seconds ago, or engaging with me, or participating in the flow of whatever is going on. 


## on scripts

The kinds of people who script social interactions and believe they're entitled to verbal engagement from someone tend to say things like:

- "say please/thank you"
- "say [...]"
- "say i love you"

I've often-enough/too-often informed others of a norm for interacting with eden: 

> we do not put words in edens mouth, or demand her to place your words in her mouth.

To the credit of some, i perceive this norm to have been well received. Adults "tell" kids to do or perform something all the time.

My parents attacked me as a child when I didn't look happy enough for them. "Have a good attitude, Josh". "Put on your happy face". "We do all things for the Lord, and He wants you to be happy." I spent enough of my life around people who heavily suppress the emotions of people around them, and I no longer permit it from other adults, when I am present. 

When Eden would cry, I've seen adults turn to her and say "you're not upset" or "don't be upset" or "here's a distraction", instead of allowing her whatever is going on, attending to the environment ("oh, you have to go to the bathroom? thanks for letting me know!"), and supporting her with their own regulated nervous system. 

Unhealthy adults need to suppress the emotions of other people if they are unable to access their own sense of that emotion. Grief and sadness and anger is heavily suppressed in evangelical/white cultures, so those are the ones children raised by them tend to not have easy access to. 

I make sure Eden knows her grief and sadness and anger do not cause me trouble, and I'm happy to support her through it all. 

## "Shy" isn't a helpful question or label

Sometimes an adult acts entitled to obtaining a certain reaction from Eden. 

Sometimes people ask me "oh, is she shy?", while Eden is with me, pointedly not making eye contact with the question-asker, who perhaps _just_ walked up and has never shared a moment of real interaction with her in the past...

They perhaps think she doesn't understand what they're saying, or isn't able to comprehend our conversation.

I say some version of:

> That framing makes useful conversation less accessible, rather than more. Eden knows that she doesn't 'need' to 'give' anyone any sort of concession, just because that person thinks they're entitled to it, nor does she need to perform for people. It's inappropriate for an adult to demand a certain kind of interaction from a child. 

I usually figure out how to be diplomatic about it, and fortunately 'shy' as a concept is sort of fading out of society, I think.

I'll always add something like:

> And _obviously_ if we don't feel comfortable with someone, we wouldn't try to act like they're a trusted person because they believe in politeness, or their feelings might get hurt. 

So, sometimes Eden pointedly refuses to even turn her face towards someone. Sometimes the person correctly infers that it's her de-escalating the intensity of the interaction, and they take their own steps to reduce the intensity, instantly and perhaps even subconsciously. 

Others cannot see it, or refuse to act on it, and instead keep stepping closer and trying to get in her face, to get her to look at them and say hello or something. Or to say "thank you" as they make an evaluation of some aspect of her physical appearance. 

Broadly, it's possibly appropriate to comment on thinking someone made distinctive choices in picking out an item of clothing or displayed prowess in judgment or skill. "sick rainbow shoes.", "that thing you did looked tricky, and skillful." 

### What not to say

I don't like to make it sound like a child's entire existence is already the same as an adult slaving away. 

References to jobs, and work, are not interesting to me, so "good job" and "nice work" are not phrases in my lexicon. "That looked interesting" and "what did you like about that?" or "did that feel tricky?" 

Eden is also _quite_ happy to stare at a something with intense focus. Sometimes it's a dog, or a bug, or a person. If the person is close enough, and notices, and feels self-conscious, they might call it a _withering intensity_. 

It's distinctive enough that complete strangers often commented on it, even at a really young age. I proffer it's maybe the look of someone who's totally focused on what they are looking at, they're not performing 'social softening' of the gaze. As a toddler, she'll turn her head to look at something as it or she passes by, in a way that is identical to when she was an infant, and I presume is motivated out of a similar-enough inner state.

She's permitted to look at something as hard as she wants, or not at all, and I perceive that some adults are unaccustomed to be looked at in such an evaluator-like, non-apologetic way, by such a young child. 

## On Beauty

I dislike the energy that old white people have, when they insert themselves into me and Eden's day to pronounce that they find her physical form appealing. It's _very_ strange to have grown adults continuously talking about the pleasing physical form of a child. (settler colonialism! Seeing children as possessions/nationalism) 

Sometimes it's very visible that an interlocutor has an internal values system that is coherent with white/american/western/racialized beauty norms, and that they see in Eden an attribute that seems coherent with their norms, it feels like they're playing a role in supporting those beauty norms. Taking anyone seriously necessitates at least being able to refrain from stating objectifying statements, or trying to. 

This feels insanely delicate to write even a few paragraphs about. I want to throw a bunch of books out that talk about 'whiteness' or 'supremacy thinking'. There's a few energies still bandying about today rooted in the beliefs that supported chattel slavery, genocide, that sort of thing. 

- [Fearing the Black Body](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42129163-fearing-the-black-body)
- [The History of White People](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6919721-the-history-of-white-people)
- [The Origins of Proslavery Christianity: White and Black Evangelicals in Colonial and Antebellum Virginia](https://www.amazon.com/Origins-Proslavery-Christianity-Evangelicals-Antebellum/dp/0807858773)
- [They Were Her Property](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40887375-they-were-her-property)

It feels vastly under-appreciated in 'normal' society how total of a regime of social control chattel slavery represented, and how fundamentally and totally the dehumanization that occurred affected the mind of the oppressor, the consciousness of the classes and races, that "it" sorta created. 

It's manifestly obvious when at least some streams of it reach out to touch Eden, and I don't like it.

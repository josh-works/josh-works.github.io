"Traffic Cones and Junction Fixes: A DIY Guide" ? _this is very drafty_

This post is probably best viewed on desktop, with some links opening new tabs, viewed, closed, and then this post returned to. There's a lot of videos farther down, some of them are tiktoks (sorry) and some of them are youtube videos (that's not my stuff) and then some of my stuff is also embedded via a service called "Wistia". I hope you watch at least some of the videos below. maybe the piece still stands up well enough without the videos. _maybe_.

## Introduction 

Here's a new word, I am introducing to the lexicon:

**Coning**, verb

> to place traffic cones at specific points in a road or junction to shape how people travel through the intersection. Simplifies and smooths complexity, increases safety for everyone. Dramatically reduces the four types of vehicle emissions: engine exhaust, brake dust, tire rubber microplastics, and noise.

Any vehicle that is accelerating from a stop to, say, 15 miles per hour, is generating all of those emissions except brake dust, and when that vehicle has to stop again, it'll generate the brake dust as well.

The noise of a vehicle is not just it's engine - lots of noise comes from the rolling of tires over a surface, and the sound of displaced air is quite loud. Brakes also often-enough generate noise. [^noise]

Another unique form of engine noise pollution is that based on how the driver uses the engine, the driver can signal to everyone something about the driver's internal emotional state. _I resent this_.

Compare accelerating and stopping behavior to travelling smoothly through a 50 meter section of road, without using the brake or gas pedal. The engine would be operating at an idle, instead of under accelleration. no brake dust, and the tire rubber microplastic generation would be at a much lower level than those same microplastics would be generated if the car was being stopped by the brakes or accellerated by the engine. 

> This seems audacious/unreasonable, josh, because...

Consider a junction in Poynton, UK. 

Here's a link to the 8 minute mark of a youtube video about this ['shared space' road junction](https://youtu.be/-vzDDMzq7d0?si=cgjINhEinykfajPD&t=483).

I wrote a bit more about Poynton on substack: [Interlude: A Pattern of Repair](https://zoningverydifferentthanours.substack.com/p/interlude-a-pattern-of-repair-episode), and then again, applying the concept to an intersection that I (unfortunately) must interact with regularly: [A Pattern of Repair: The 'traffic bean'](https://zoningverydifferentthanours.substack.com/p/a-pattern-of-repair-the-traffic-bean)

'coning' an intersection would be less intensive a treatment than a traffic bean, yet both obviously move with the same sorts of energies.

A few times I've had the priviledge of stumbling into an idea, act, or articulation that, while firmly rooted in banal phenomena in one domain, feels quite novel when applied to a new domain. This thing I'm discussing in this post is one of those novel things.

'coning' a road, street, or junction is one of those banal-and-novel acts. 

I'll explain below, and I hope you might try something similar some day for yourself.

## Examples of my own coning adventures

Here's one of the very first traffic cones I set out, in my whole life, with the goal of creating/providing safety in mind.

### 1. South Denver, a pedestrian crossing of a residential road


One rainy day, I observed from my bedroom these traffic cones floating down the street. The video tells the rest of the story:

[https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7240202349451595054](https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7240202349451595054)

I started with what most traffic planners in America would start with: Bulb-outs

As you can see in the end of the video, nothing really seemed to change. I ended up with a small change in placement (instead of bulb-outs, I placed the cones where the lane divider would be), and a HUGE change in behavior:

[https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7240611295966268718](https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7240611295966268718)

please notice in all these timelapses that people are walking down the street, the length of it. See how they scurry out of the road when a car is present, and how confidently they walk when there is no car.

Anyway, ^^ that video above was my first foray into this coning thing. 

Here's a reminder of what the street looks like without any cones: [https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7250134620694482218](https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7250134620694482218)

As I say in that video, the mom who walked by was wise to warn her kid about the dangers of the road. Isn't it a bummer? She's using the road exactly like a car would, why does she have to be threatened with horrible violence continuously by passing cars? [^streets-free-of-cars]

[^streets-free-of-cars]: some people might say 'well the danger from cars is a fact of life' and I'd retort that just as cars have streets that connect them to places, a sane mobility network would have a similar level of 'street ennervation' via _car free_ streets, as well. If even one out of five of every north/south and east/west streets was shut down to cars passing through via modal filters, and slight [traffic bean](https://zoningverydifferentthanours.substack.com/p/a-pattern-of-repair-the-traffic-bean) type treatment at the junctions where cars pass, the network would be transformed. It's not 'complete streets' it's 'connected car-free streets'. Linear park type vibes would be the obvious upgrade to car-free streets.

The following 

[https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7250134620694482218](https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7250134620694482218)



another view of the same treatment:

[https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7240680684472274218](https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7240680684472274218)

These cones remained in place _for weeks_. No one moved them for such a long time. 

Now, the above videos all highlighted the placement of the cones. Here's a different view, I think the drone perspective is very interesting. From most points of view, the cones are almost invisible. what an elegant intervention:

[https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7240668293420322091](https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7240668293420322091)

another view:

[https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7240665861508402478](https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7240665861508402478)

another view:

At this point, the satisfaction I derive from this kind of stuff is undoubtedly similar to what some people experience with public art, graffiti, etc. 

Here's the lightest-weight intervention I've ever did, that worked shockingly well:

[https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7249134328502947118](https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7249134328502947118)




### 2. South Denver, noise reduction on an arterial going past cafes, breweries, lots of outdoor seating

This treatment was excellent, I'm pleased with the results, the noise level came down by so much, AND things were made way safer. 

The cones were taken away after a few hours


That idea gave birth to the second iteration, sorta on the same walking path two blocks down:

<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/player.js" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/lqt60rz6m1.js" async type="module"></script><style>wistia-player[media-id='lqt60rz6m1']:not(:defined) { background: center / contain no-repeat url('https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/lqt60rz6m1/swatch'); display: block; filter: blur(5px); padding-top:177.78%; }</style> <wistia-player media-id="lqt60rz6m1" aspect="0.5625"></wistia-player>

Another intersection, later in time:

<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/player.js" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/kuqbgipm8a.js" async type="module"></script><style>wistia-player[media-id='kuqbgipm8a']:not(:defined) { background: center / contain no-repeat url('https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/kuqbgipm8a/swatch'); display: block; filter: blur(5px); padding-top:177.78%; }</style> <wistia-player media-id="kuqbgipm8a" aspect="0.5625"></wistia-player>

The way one might use this phrase/concept is like so:

> Ick, this street is loud and dangerous, I wish someone would put some cones down.

or

> that person almost hit that other person with their car - if that intersection was properly coned it wouldn't have happened.

or

> The noise along this road is wild. if the area got well-coned, it would be way quieter. 

Here's another denver-area coning, very close to a few different climbing gyms, schools, parks, apartment buildings. I was very pleased with this one. All of these intersections by the way are STILL INADEQUATE even with these cones:

https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7249752983481732394

A fully complete intersection would have something like a built-in 'traffic curve', either a [traffic bean](https://zoningverydifferentthanours.substack.com/p/a-pattern-of-repair-the-traffic-bean), or if that is a bit too big, the 'coning' of the intersection could cause a small deviation in vehicle path.

The big issue is: if the intersection accommodates vehicles passing through it fast, say, 35 mph, without any change in direction, even a slight wiggle/deviation, it's not fully fixed.

In all these intersections, I didn't place any cones that wasn't delimiting what is already theoretically delimited, It's a good enough proof of concept, though, and shows that with a tiny bit of work, any unwanted speed can be filtered out, by these cones, and building little gates, defined curves, turn radii, etc.

The experience of everyone NOT in a vehicle goes up enormously in these situations. It's almost dedignifying to enumerate the ways.

I am extremely aware of how dangerous roads and junctions are. [^obvious-danger] Cars feel to me as dangerous as guns, and I'm accutely aware of when a car is pointed at me, if it is in motion _and_ when it's stationary, if there is someone in the driver's seat, same as I'd be aware of a gun being pointed at me. 

The driver of that car could kill me with the press of a foot with a car, just as the user of a gun could kill someone with the press of a finger. Check out my piece on bollards for more: [Bollards: What and Why]({{ site.baseurl  }}{% link _posts/2024-04-30-bollards.md %}).

I am unable to dissociate from shit roads and dangerous dynamics created by those road designers, and the people who use them. I've slightly unusual points of view, but I am aware of feeling something similar about roads my whole life. I am sensitive, sometimes extremely sensitive, and in ways that unavoidably inconvenience others. If you talk to some former partners, you could get long lists of ways my sensitivity and emotional delicacy has been experienced as extremely inconveniencing.

Cars, even when the engines are idling or the vehicle is electric are so loud, and one can infer so much about a vehicle and its driver from things like:

- relative ratios of accelerating, coasting, braking. (In a 100 second segment of driving, what is the ratio between accelerating, coasting, braking? How quickly does the driver cycle between the three, and how smoothly or sharply?)
- speed in many different ways - speed through curves, speed through turns

this list is simply some of the things one can infer about cars from the _noise_. Just the noise. 



### 3. Centeral Denver, reducing noise, improving awareness

[https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7249752983481732394](https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7249752983481732394)

My friend and I did this, as we rode our scooters past, a few blocks from his house, a few blocks from two climbing gyms, grocery stores. There's a school directly adjacent to the intersection. It is not tolerable, the speeds that can be accessed by people going straight through the intersection, and how crossing it requires one to deconflict with so much space, in both directions. 

The cones we put down obviously changes the turn radii for cars, and created little 'protected pockets' for passers-by, without causing a foot or bike barrier for anyone not in a car. 

### 4. Loveland, pedestrian crossing of a four lane road with sometimes 50+mph traffic, I got to plan a project with the local city engineer

I later spent some time living adjacent to this intersection, which had a whole fascinating saga. Here's what happened.

First, I lived next to this wildly unsafe junction that feels both rural and urban. Rural, in terms of how fast/straight the roads are, and the spacing of lights, lane widths, etc. Most people driving through this intersection are coming from 'rural' points of origin.

Eventually, in talking to neighbors, I heard stories of many car accidents, deaths, vehicles bouncing into yards, fences, trees, etc.

I found a bunch of traffic cones a short walk away, and the ideas started to emerge.

<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/player.js" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/iobo0kmb31.js" async type="module"></script><style>wistia-player[media-id='iobo0kmb31']:not(:defined) { background: center / contain no-repeat url('https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/iobo0kmb31/swatch'); display: block; filter: blur(5px); padding-top:177.78%; }</style> <wistia-player media-id="iobo0kmb31" aspect="0.5625"></wistia-player>

I planned where I'd put cones, and then did so, and got the whole before/during/after on video via drone. The improvements were magnificent.

Unfortunately for all of us, this was an event witnessed almost exclusively by me. No one else was there to agree with me on how much better it was, besides the people using the junction. Most drivers simply let off the gas and _coasted_ straight through the intersection.

Those that turned reduced their speeds appropriately to turn. 

It was glorious. Eventually, I went back out with _more_ cones, and city employees followed me, and tried to get me to take the cones down. (using implication, never threats or demands). 

I simply did my normal word-vomit when talking to authority figures: I flood them with polite, relentless, technically-laced monologue. References to the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices, street typologies and the implication on sightlines, speed calculations, grief (over all of our loved ones killed on/by american roads), 'we are all out here, together, united by our desire for us and our loved ones to continue to survive'. 

Usually they glaze over, like a dog that licked a toad and now wants the taste out of its mouth.

They left, and returned with a member of the local deputized slave patrol. 

She did the threatening and provocative “I need your name and ID, any prior arrests or anything I should be worried about?” routine. (Isn't it funny how slave patrollers will weaponize their own discomfort, in a way that makes it obviously a threat?)

Again, I did the verbal vomit thing, as only a wealthy-enough-to-have-access-to-lawyers-passing, white-passing american man can do. I have the privilege of treating the deputized slave patrol as a tool for people just like me. I can embody this energy, as I was raised by a person who was also a preacher and a doctor and a military pilot and a supremacist and a military officer and had a penis and was white-passing. He huffed hard on the 'authority and patriarchy/supremacy' pipe.  

Me:

> How often do you deal with car accidents? Lots, really? Isn't that annoying? Here's a way to make for less car accidents, obviously this shouldn't be _your_ problem, it's an engineering thing, maybe you can help me find the person in the city responsible for the road right here?

she gave me a hint ("talk to {so-and-so} in the city admin office") which I kept 'privilege escalating' until I was wandering around the city of loveland department of works office building, and found my way to the city engineer's office, Matt. The admin person gave me his email address, phone number, his physical address. It was a few blocks away in a different building so I popped over and the door I parked my scooter next to was unlocked, so I wandered inside. I've never been inside a municipal streets authority building before, and having read [the power broker]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2024-05-27-robert-moses.md %}) I was attending to every detail.

Lots of interesting stuff inside (a sign making shop, feeds from traffic cameras) and implications for anyone who's read [seeing like a state](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/), like... I see why big ugly rural intersections seem so important to municipal people. They have billboard-sized TV's displaying dozens of feeds of intersections. It was one of the ugliest and most depressing things I could imagine looking at all day.

[traffic beans](https://zoningverydifferentthanours.substack.com/p/a-pattern-of-repair-the-traffic-bean), remember? Breaks my heart to see an intersection empty, with cars sitting around waiting to go through. The rate at which people's time is being wasted is _stunning_

Anyway, Matt had time, and was thrilled to nerd out about road junctions. hardly sixty seconds of conversation elapsed, as I gave him a short version of how I ended up in his office, before he had google earth open and we were zipping around Loveland 'looking' at intersections. We spoke for a while, it was all interesting. He seemed to obviously want at least some of the same safety outcomes I wanted. What I soon ran into is the very american assumption that 'fast vehicle movement' correlates at all with 'good enough trip time', among other assumptions.

He and I swapped emails, and eventually met up again at a few different intersections within loveland, him in his city pickup truck, me on my scooter, to walk around and look at different bits of 'pedestrian infrastructure'. I kept gently pushing my goal along (a coned-and-traffic-bean'ed intersection) and eventually _got permission from him to treat with hay bales a connected series of road segments/junctions, including the one directly next to the house I was living in, that I could see from my front window_.

The plan was: 

1. using hay bales, the smallish rectangular ones, I could build roundabout/traffic-bean-type junctions, defining the inner and outer edges of the junctions with hay bales, leaving the open space free to people walking/biking, and shaping the flow of traffic to that traffic-bean-vibe
2. We were going to treat a series of connected intersections, including the ones closest to where I was living at the time, NOT including, in the first pass, the intersection I had first treated

I was thrilled, even as it was the smallest definition of the experiment. My plan was, upon my return to that house, try to obtain a pile of hay bales and then, while he stood next to me, start arranging them on the various junctions. I obviously had a plan in mind for where bales might go on each junction.

I'd ended up travelling out of contry while he and I was discussing it, was gone for a while, ended up moving, and i returned to loveland only for a few hours to collect my stuff. That hard-won project never moved forward. I am still proud of how far I got with my hay-bale traffic bean plan, though. 

### 5. Humboldt & 16th

I moved back to Denver. Soon ended up living where I currently live, as I write these words. Near this intersection at Humboldt and 16th ave. Colefax is the name for 15th ave, so this street is but a single block from Colefax. If you live in the Denver area, you know Colefax. 

This street-level video shows a family driving on bicycles, then a bunch of passing cars. Can you see the obvious danger? I sometimes fear I'm belaboring the point, yet I still encounter people that can look at _obviously dangerous interactions_ and not see them.

### Misc other intersections

Long ago, around the time of my first 'coning': [this drone video of this walk with someone using a wheelchair](https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7249498446703791406) is interesting to me. Explains why I don't always hew to sidewalks like some people would want me to, as if they expected me to act obedient to their entitlement.
- [another video from the above walk](https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7249448308211764526). Again, I think the minimum reasonable starting point is _close most roads to vehicle throughput_, and can you see how an arterial functions as a wall?

## General complaints about inadequate and dangerous and inefficient American intersections

Oh, I have beef with American intersections. I hate to use them, to even witness them, so I don't travel much by car, and when I do, it feels emotionally expensive. Feels like I'm walking on the graveyard of evidence of ethnic cleansing, and I cannot help but feel affected by the weight over the years of the death, bloodshed, misery, destroyed places and humans, that this whole regime represents.

Intersections in america are as consumptive as any other part of a colonial culture. They perform unimaginably inefficiently.

I wish all junctions could be evaluated by the `vehicles per square meter per second` standard. [Here's a bit more about that, on my/this substack](https://zoningverydifferentthanours.substack.com/i/158451046/some-things-about-the-current-junction)

## Common complaints/FAQs:

> But Josh this is non traditional and I don't think it will work or should work.

How interesting. [Here's another video for how land is modified in expensive places to accommodate cars](https://www.tiktok.com/@josh_exists/video/7248901359234485550)

I contend that any modification or change to the norm is, in principal, possibly worth entertaining.

The 'building line' and setbacks are based on the roads, so every house is built up to a spot determined by the road. Even non-road space is dictated by roads!



## Footnotes

[^obvious-danger]: Many, many people seem disconnected, emotionally, physically, with something about the experience of being in/around personal vehicles. I could rant/rave about americans, but it's really american-ness, which is a certain form of supremacy thinking. How many of your friends need to have been killed by a person driving a car, for you to have some unenjoyable emotional experiences with aspects of being around anyone who is driving? How many people that you know need to have been hit by someone in a car (but not killed!) for you to sorta not be down with the whole thing? How about animals killed? 

[^noise]: The noise cuts through walls, in sometimes wildly-distracting ways. It's hard to write about the experience of noise, since the happen in such different mediums. 

    Should I add a 🚗 emoji every time my brain notes a car driving past, while I write this? It's happened three times in the last sentence. 🚗🚗🚗 catches the car counter up to here. It's not rush hour, sometimes the vehicle frequency is much higher. 🚗

    Not so long ago, I 🚗 got permission from the city engineer and mayor of Golden to try cone-based speed shaping experiments in Golden, and since then have replicated the treatment and results on many different intersections. There's a clear chronological 🚗 unfolding. I'm pleased to have video footage of almost every treatment I've ever done. 

    The 'treatment' always varies, by the way, based on the junction, how people already use it, how many cones are available, and more. The exact treatment also unfolds🚗  with some iteration, 🚗 as you'll see in some of the videos. A lot of walking around and making small adjustments. 

    🚗 🚗

    i'll stop with the "🚗 every time a car 🚗 drives past" because it's annoying enough to experience, let alone accommodate in my writing now. I imagine you can sympathize with me being at times resentful of how an engine or a vehicle passes by and I hear it so loudly. Cities are not loud, cars are loud. When cars are not driving around (like 'a sunday morning with 2 inches of snow on the ground') the entire area is so, so quiet. When it's really quiet, you can hear car engines from blocks away, sometimes. Sigh.

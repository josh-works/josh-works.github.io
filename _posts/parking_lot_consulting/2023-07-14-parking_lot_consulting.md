Hi there! I'm Josh, and I'm your local neighborhood "parking lot advocate". 

We're talking about parking lots today. Your parking lot has a job to do, and every day, every night, rain or shine, hot or cold, clear, rainy, or snowy, your parking lot does the best it can at it's job.

But how well does it do it's job? What _is_ the job of a parking lot, exactly, anyway?

# The jobs of a parking lot

Like any potential representative of your business, at minimum, you want your parking lot to serve a certain function, around:

- storing vehicles
- finding empty spaces
- leaving the parking lot after finishing up at the facility
- moving people from where they parked their vehicle to an entrance to your facility

And, again, like a representative of your business, you don't want it to look dirty, unclean, slovenly, or dangerous. 


# Signs your parking lot might be broken

There's a few ways you could determine if your parking lot is doing it's job well or poorly. For example, are any of the following true for you?

- customers sometimes have difficulty finding open parking spaces, and instead "cruise" past many occupied spaces before finding an available space
- heavy use of 'desire paths'[^desire-path]
- it feels 'creepy' under certain conditions/times of day, especially at night
- first-time guests sometimes have a hard time finding where to park, and then quickly/confidently making their way to the entrance of your facility
- at peak times of day, members/guests/customers know that if they wanted to visit your facility, they'd have a hard time finding a parking spot
- you sometimes have conflict with other businesses that make use of nearby parking areas. Their customers park in your parking, or your customers sometimes park in their parking, and this causes friction
- your parking lot doesn't generate any ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’° , which pays for it's own improvements.[^pay-for-itself]
- if your parking lot _does_ generate revenue, it leaves a bad taste in the mouths of the users who have to pay. _most_ paid parking in America is not managed at a competent level.

Remember - people are creatures of habit and convenience. When we find parking lots difficult to deal with, we're vastly less likely to frequent the business attached to that parking lot. _people will subconsiously avoid parking lots completely._ [^dread-of-parking-lots]

[^dread-of-parking-lots]: For example, here's a passionate complaint about a Trader Joe's parking lot. Trader Joe's is losing business because the parking lot is so bad at it's job:

    [I Am a Trader Joe's Parking Lot and I am Here to Destroy You]() (finish this copy/paste from WA, add fb comment screenshots)

    Here's the kinds of things people say:

    > Can we all agree that [this parking lot] is the most terrible one in Boise (I mean it's like a pit of hell)?

    > When I want to go to Trader Joe's I always think... 'do I really want to park in there?'

    > [That parking lot] is literally the worst, and is 10,000,000% why I'll never go there again.

    > It's horrible. I avoid Trader Joe's just because of the parking lot.

    _add screenshots/google maps/google earth/street view data_


[^desire-path]: A 'desire path' is an 'unofficial' path, usually made by people choosing to walk where there isn't an official path. Generally, if you want to help people get to where they want to go, a good rule of thumb is to identify all desire paths as they appear, and add some 'dressing' to the path to make it official, and safe. Desire paths often start as dirt paths, and these get muddy in the rain, dangerous in the snow, and are rarely ploughed. 

# The cost of your parking lot being broken

There are real costs to your parking lot not doing it's job well enough. The most obvious cost is the waste of customer good-will. While most people know that any issues with a parking lot isn't necessarily the fault of the business they're frequenting, not everyone knows this. Lots of people take their frustration on parking out directly on the business they're trying to visit, and a 'challenging' parking lot costs you customers.

To repeat a quote:

> [That parking lot] is literally the worst, and is 10,000,000% why I'll never go there again.

So, in some cases, your parking lot costs you customers directly.

Even if customers still push through the discomfort, though, clunking parking now costs your customers time, and frustration. It's extremely annoying to 'cruise' around for parking. 


# The ROI of fixing your parking lot


## More Customers

A well-managed parking lot is an efficient parking lot. Would you like it more if every time someone came to your facility, they drove alone, or if they came as a group or two or three?

If your parking is anywhere close to being full, you would want to see your visitors share cars. That takes the vehicle space consumption per person go from 300sqft of your parking lot to 150 sqft, or 100sq ft. 



## A Better Experience

Every time a customer or staff member feels frustration looking for parking and/or dealing with a long walk, that's a spot that could have been a moment of delight. [^walt-disney]

[^walt-disney]: The Disney theme parks (Disney Land and Disney World) are famous for how 'coherent' the guest experience is. Disney understands that creating a good experience for their visitors means thinking clearly and openly and creatively about their parking areas. I seek to channel some of the Disney energy in how I approach parking lots. It is worth mentioning that Disney is _extremely_ financially successful, in part because of how pleasent the parks are to visit, and how coherent the experience is for the guests.

There's different 'levels of sophistication' for your parking lot.

At the top level, we have an easy-to-install vehicle counter that hooks up to a sign at the entrance and reports on how many parking spaces are available at that current moment. This improves discoverability. 

Also, at the top level, the parking lot _has the option_ to not be free parking. Don't worry, I'd never suggest adding a swing arm to your parking lot. Those swing arms are like black-and-white televisions. They were good enough once, but no longer interesting.

## Simple responsibility

Pull up your business on google maps, in satallite view. Zoom in on your business, so your business and the parking lot fills most of your screen.

In the area, how many square meters are filled by your buildings?

Now, how many square meters are filled by your parking areas and approach paths?

If you're like many businesses in America, for every square meter under a roof, you might have three or four square meters of space allocated to parking.

# Let's look at some parking lots together

Your parking lots do much more than hold parked cars.

Here's some of the parking lots I've looked at lately. Let's talk about some of what we see.

First, here's the things I tend to notice, on first blush:

1. How _big_ is the parking lot. how many spaces?
2. What part of the parking lot is closest to the main entrance? This portion of your parking lot will be the busiest and most important part.
3. How wide are the driving lanes? How easy is it to find available spots?
4. Do people 'cruise' a lot when looking for parking? 
5. How well lit is it at night. Is the lighting warm or cold?
6. What kind of situations and dynamics exist around the junction between your parking lot and adjoining roads. Do customers have an easy and safe and protect way to get _into_ your parking lot, without having to wait a long time for a gap in traffic?
7. When leaving your parking lot, is it easy-enough to get going the desired direction on the local roads?

Here's some other data-based questions that can be answered with observation or conversations:

1. How long is the longest time it took someone to find a parking spot in the last week?
2. how common are break-ins? is there an issue of safety in the parking lot, either from people in cars, or people not in cars?

Now, lets's stop thinking about your parking lot for a minute, and think of what a parking lot can represent at it's best.

Sometimes some of the space in or around a parking lot might serve as a [third space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place), or a pathway for your customers from one place (where they parked) to another (your business) and back, or for non-customers or future customers to pass by your business. Third spaces are best when they are _beautiful_, so a defining question you can ask of your parking lot is - is it beautiful?

If it isn't beautiful, or at least there are not spots of beauty, then there ISN'T 'third space' vibes in your parking lot, this is one of the things I can eventually fix, but only in parallel with making it feel clean and safe.



# How we'd fix your parking lot

You might be intrigued, now, and inclined to investigate more. 

The easiest next step would be to pop your email address into this form below, and you'll automatically get a few emails over the next two weeks that will make you an even more sophisticated observer and evaluator of your parking lot.

_add CK form here, in the meantime [send me an email](mailto:joshthompson@hey.com) and i'll follow up from there_

Here's what we'll do, when we start working on your parking lot together:

## Step 1: Evaluation of what it's "job to be done" is, and how well it's doing it

As you can imagine, there's lots of similarities between parking lots across America, but every parking lot is a little distinctive. Step one will be opening up the parking lot on Google maps/google earth, and seeing how it looks.

## Step 2: 



This service is a mix of consultation and analysis, obviously. And then making small changes, and deciding how we like things, and then developing what we like and redeveloping what we don't yet like. 

First, we'd aim to make safer spots where cars and people have dangerous interactions. Incidents involving cars striking pedestrians continue to climb, but a little attention to any given space can make it much less likely that those accidents will happen in your parking lot. 

Next, we'll decide what part of your parking lot is already the most heavily used by people, closest to gathering points, and naturally comfortable. We'll make it _more_ comfortable, and add small/cheap bits of 'street furnature' to create some outdoor spaces, by creating the feeling of semi-enclosed spaces. Maybe we'll hang some outdoor string lights on a timer to cozy up the space on those early winter evenings. 

This can be accomplished by an easy arrangement of something no more fancy than a medium-sized metal planter, but can instantly change the vibe and shape of the space.

Rinse, and repeat. 

Here's some videos about how I've improved the safety and convenience of certain spots, with far more time spent recording the video than I spent modifying the space.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why do you work directly with businesses to provide this service instead of talking to {local municipality}?

I actually have spoken to many local municipalities, and that's what led me to this current service! 

I've found many 'local municipal traffic & right-of-way people' to be quite amenable to what I'm working on, and anytime I've brought a sensible plan to them and the resources to implement it, they've supported it, no matter how resource-constrained they are in terms of calendar, budget, etc.

I've worked with city engineers, planning staff, public works officials, political leaders (mayors, city council people) and more, and in every case have walked away with a solution everyone's happy with.

That all said, I've found that there's quite a lot of 'work that can be done' before any of that work escalates to something that would make sense to loop the city in on. So, I'll do the work for you that doesn't involve the local municipality, and then when it becomes needful to include them, i can handle much of that work as well.

## Why do you talk so much about those orange traffic cones

Because traffic cones are the first tool I use for changing how traffic flows through an area. Cars, bikes, and people 'flow' a bit like water, a bit like a gas. 

Traffic cones are like placing a rock in a stream - it changes the flow of the water, even as it doesn't change how much water flows through the space.

This concept is the core of how I start making fixes in a given area. I look at it, watch it for a while, see how people use it, and then start making experimental changes. As few as one or two cones can make a big difference in very specific ways. 

## How do you price this?

First, we schedule a roadmapping session - in person, if possible, via zoom if not. This is a fixed fee, and is no more onerous to you than us participating in a zoom call where I present my initial findings, gathered from google earth, street view, and any photos or videos you and I can get. 

This is a fixed, one-time fee. From it you'll get a report outlining what I think should be done, in a way that minimizes effort on everyone's behalf. 

Next, if you'd like to oversee the implementation yourself, I can be available on a retainer to help navigate the project. 

If you want me to oversee it directly, that is also available on something of a consulting model. In some circumstances, I might do at least some of the work directly, and where it makes sense, I'll be on-sight to directly guide the project. 

I price by a flat fee for the initial consult. A small parking area is $500, a large one (200 spaces +) will cost $3000.

the optional retainer, consulting, and implementation options will all be shared in the roadmapping document. 


## What kind of improvements will you bring about?

I'll help your parking lot fit more vehicles, i'll help your visitors spend less time looking for parking, and overall, they will all appreciate how intentional _you_ are about tending well to your whole lot.

There's behavior change baked into all of this, but primarily by creating attractive paths and patterns that we most want your customers to use. I'm rather opposed to coercion, and even see the existence of some written signs and notifications as a possible failure of good design.

## What sort of ideas/people/ideas are you implementing?

Great question - nothing is new under the sun.

Primarily, I endeavor to appropriately channel three people: Christopher Alexander, Donald Shoup, and Alain Bertaud.

These individuals are all giants in the 'urbanism space', and have kindly left us detailed written resources for how they would approach a given situation or problem. 

They are consummate professionals, and if you were able to hire any of _them_ to fix these problems, you'd be thrilled for their attention. One of them is no longer living, and the other two are busy, so you'll have to settle for engaging with me on this. :)

Critically, if you could hang out with them, they would all convey to you a sense of:

1. the issues you perceive related to your parking lot are valid
2. the issues can be _greatly_ improved, along the way changing the spaces into something healthy, safe, and self-sustaining/supporting, financially and otherwise.

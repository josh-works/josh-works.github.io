Your parking lots do much more than hold parked cars - they also move people from their parked cars to access your business. 

Here's some of the parking lots I've looked at lately:

These videos are NOT intended to convey anything about how I would evaluate a parking lot, or any specific changes that might be made. They're simple examples of how I look at parking lots, and how they connect to spaces around them.

Sometimes some of the space in or around a parking lot might serve a a [third space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place), or a pathway for your customers from one place (where they parked) to another (your business) and back, or for non-customers or future customers to pass by your business.

If there ISN'T 'third space' vibes in your parking lot, this is one of the things I can eventually fix, but only in parallel with making it feel clean and safe.

Therefore, we can work together to:

1. Decide the ROI of spending any resources and energy on your parking lot, and if so, what might be the smallest/quickest/most educational first pass.
2. Once the schedule makes sense, arrange to have the parking lot cleaned and organized, at least a little
3. as we clean and organize it, we'll start playing with traffic flows, to reduce any pain points and 'issue hot spots'. This is where the users of the parking lot will start feeling the main improvements, so I'd like to accomplish step three fairly quickly. once we kick off the project

# Signs your parking (lot) is broken, and thus in need of repair

- not enough spaces at certain times
- dangerous situations loading/unloading vehicles
- customers/staff cruising (looking) for spaces
- heavy use of desire paths
- it feeling 'creepy' under certain conditions/times of day

I'm _obsessed_ with outdoor connecting spaces, parking lots all that with relates to them, and can easily bring huge improvements to most spaces, though certainly not all. We'll talk about that in the first meeting.

# How I'd actually fix it

This service is a mix of consultation and analysis, obviously. And then making small changes, and deciding how we like things, and then developing what we like and redeveloping what we don't yet like. 

First, we'd aim to make safer spots where cars and people have dangerous interactions. Incidents involving cars striking pedestrians continue to climb, but a little attention to any given space can make it much less likely that those accidents will happen in your parking lot. 

Next, we'll decide what part of your parking lot is already the most heavily used by people, closest to gathering points, and naturally comfortable. We'll make it _more_ comfortable, and add small/cheap bits of 'street furnature' to create some outdoor spaces, by creating the feeling of semi-enclosed spaces. Maybe we'll hang some outdoor string lights on a timer to cozy up the space on those early winter evenings. 

This can be accomplished by an easy arrangement of something no more fancy than a medium-sized metal planter, but can instantly change the vibe and shape of the space.

Rinse, and repeat. 

Here's some videos about how I've improved the safety and convenience of certain spots, with far more time spent recording the video than I spent modifying the space.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why do you work directly with businesses to provide this service instead of talking to {local municipality}?

I actually have spoken to many local municipalities, and that's what led me to this current service! 

I've found many 'local municipal traffic & right-of-way people' to be quite amenable to what I'm working on, and anytime I've brought a sensible plan to them and the resources to implement it, they've supported it, no matter how resource-constrained they are in terms of calendar, budget, etc.

I've worked with city engineers, planning staff, public works officials, political leaders (mayors, city council people) and more, and in every case have walked away with a solution everyone's happy with.

That all said, I've found that there's quite a lot of 'work that can be done' before any of that work escalates to something that would make sense to loop the city in on. So, I'll do the work for you that doesn't involve the local municipality, and then when it becomes needful to include them, i can handle much of that work as well.

## Why do you talk so much about those orange traffic cones

Because traffic cones are the first tool I use for changing how traffic flows through an area. Cars, bikes, and people 'flow' a bit like water, a bit like a gas. 

Traffic cones are like placing a rock in a stream - it changes the flow of the water, even as it doesn't change how much water flows through the space.

This concept is the core of how I start making fixes in a given area. I look at it, watch it for a while, see how people use it, and then start making experimental changes. As few as one or two cones can make a big difference in very specific ways. 

## How do you price this?

First, we schedule a roadmapping session - in person, if possible, via zoom if not. This is a fixed fee, and is no more onerous to you than us participating in a zoom call where I present my initial findings, gathered from google earth, street view, and any photos or videos you and I can get. 

This is a fixed, one-time fee. From it you'll get a report outlining what I think should be done, in a way that minimizes effort on everyone's behalf. 

Next, if you'd like to oversee the implementation yourself, I can be available on a retainer to help navigate the project. 

If you want me to oversee it directly, that is also available on something of a consulting model. In some circumstances, I might do at least some of the work directly, and where it makes sense, I'll be on-sight to directly guide the project. 

I price by a flat fee for the initial consult. A small parking area is $500, a large one (200 spaces +) will cost $3000.

the optional retainer, consulting, and implementation options will all be shared in the roadmapping document. 


## What kind of improvements will you bring about?

I'll help your parking lot fit more vehicles, i'll help your visitors spend less time looking for parking, and overall, they will all appreciate how intentional _you_ are about tending well to your whole lot.

There's behavior change baked into all of this, but primarily by creating attractive paths and patterns that we most want your customers to use. I'm rather opposed to coercion, and even see the existence of some written signs and notifications as a possible failure of good design.

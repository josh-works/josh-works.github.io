Your parking lots do much more than hold parked cars - they also move people from their parked cars to access your business. 

Sometimes parking lots serve as a bit of a [third space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place)

I'd like to do a few things that relate to your parking lot, at the same time:

1. Create something that feels like a third space
2. Increase the value you and your customers and staff get from the parking lot
3. Make it more pleasent and beautiful to use. It's _deeply_ psychologically healthy to be around beauty and nature, and I'll help your parking area feel beautiful, by injecting tiny bits of nature back into that space. 

# you should keep reading if:

- you, your customers, or your staff sometimes feel pain or inconvenience around using your parking lot.
- You're willing to do something that's slightly novel and unconventional
- you're willing to make small bets and run small experiments on the outdoor areas of your lot




# Signs your parking (lot) is broken

- not enough spaces at certain times
- dangerous situations loading/unloading vehicles
- customers/staff cruising (looking) for spaces


I'm _obsessed_ with parking lots and everything about them, and I'd like to help yours work better.

I'll start helping you with yours.

It's a mix of consultation and analysis, obviously. And then making small changes, and deciding how we like things. 

Rinse, and repeat. 

Here's some videos about how I've improved the safety and convenience of certain spots:

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why do you talk so much about those orange traffic cones

Because traffic cones are the first tool I use for changing how traffic flows through an area. Cars, bikes, and people 'flow' a bit like water, a bit like a gas. 

Traffic cones are like placing a rock in a stream - it changes the flow of the water, even as it doesn't change how much water flows through the space.

This concept is the core of how I start making fixes in a given area. I look at it, watch it for a while, see how people use it, and then start making experimental changes. As few as one or two cones can make a big difference in very specific ways. 

## Why don't you talk to your local city officials?

This is a great question, and I've done that, regularly. I've had meetings with Mayors, City Engineers, Planning officials, police officers, Department of Transportation officials, and many, many more.

A universal theme emerges from these meetings:

1. Everyone sorta wants the right thing
2. No one can really do anything to deviate from the status quo

Repeatedly, my efforts and goals have been blessed by the powers-that-be, even as they admit there's nothing they can do to aid my projects. They've all said they wouldn't act to inhibit any of my projects.

## Why do you think you can make anything be better?

American land-use policy is widely regarded by serious people as 'so hilarously bad', expecially for certain people and in certain places.

I cannot fix American land use policy, but I can make it's harms be less harmful to _you_, by improving how your parking lot functions.

## What kind of improvements will you bring about?

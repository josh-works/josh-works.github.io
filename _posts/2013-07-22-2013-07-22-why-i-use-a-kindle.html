<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Ereader-ebook-reader/dp/B007HCCNJU">Amazon's e-reader</a> is extremely functional. Most reasons to <em>not</em> use one focus either on practical issues (depending on something with a battery) or on aesthetic reasons. These are valid issues, of course, but these pale in comparison to the many, many reasons <em>to</em> use a Kindle.<!--more-->

<ol>
<li>Extremely portable</li>
<li>Â Quite compact</li>
<li>Can hold near-infinite number of books</li>
<li>Instantly acquire new books.</li>
<li>Purchased books are cheaper on Kindle than physical books (usually)</li>
<li>You can "rent" books on your Kindle from a library - without ever going to the library.</li>
<li>Easy to use one-handed, either lying down (in bed) or standing up (metro).</li>
<li>Built-in dictionary for all those words you don't know how to use. (Oh, and you can have dictionaries in just about any language.)</li>
<li>No page-turning - just tap a convenient button that is ambidextrous.</li>
<li>You can read while eating without your book falling shut.</li>
<li>You can hold it with one hand <em>and</em> turn pages. Simultaneously. Difficult to do with a regular book.</li>
<li>When not in use, fold the cover shut, and drop it in the thinnest pocket of whatever bag you're carrying with you. (You <em>do</em> have a cover for it, right?)</li>
<li>
<em></em>It weighs less than just about any book you could buy.</li>
<li>It takes up less space than just about any book you could buy.</li>
<li>While it does require charging, I find myself charging it less than once a month. (And I use it a lot.)</li>
<li>You can play games on it, if you're so inclined.</li>
<li>You can have it for $69.</li>
<li>It uses the Amazon bookstore. Amazon is awesome.</li>
<li>It makes reading fun, so you read more than you would otherwise.</li>
<li>It can hold over a thousand books simultaneously, so you can start slimming down your library.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a short list of how I do most of my reading. If you don't have a Kindle yet, look into it. It could change your life.</p>

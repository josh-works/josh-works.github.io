_this is still in draft status, obviously_

[Write it now](https://josh.works/write-it-now), obviously. Been discussing this and writing about it and it feels _so fucking obvious_ in some ways.

Maybe relates to the prior piece about the expectations of social control endemic to oppressive/suppressive people. If they wrap themselves with violence, it can be hard to exist alongside these folks. (rip, native populations living anywhere alongside settler colonialists)

I've been hassling some of the adults in my life lately over things that relate to the word "spanking". 

I call it "hitting", and you can feel the conversation shift when the language gets shifted.

I think it feels like I am asserting a certain frame (as described sort of by [knowingless/frame-control](knowingless.org/frame-control))

(I totally am, or at least I'm rejecting their assertion of _their_ frame. From the POV of someone in that spot, it'll feel very similar.)

I told one of my childhood caretakers recently something like:

> If I did to you right now, what you did to me as a child, you would _correctly_ be able to have me imprisoned for _assault_. If I ripped your clothing off before I did it, to expose your genitiles and buttocks, I'd get imprisoned for _sexual assault_. 

This person then said:

> But if I didn't do that, how could I have controlled you?

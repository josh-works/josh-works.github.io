<p>Yesterday I mentioned that <a href="http://josh.works/blog/advantage-of-low-friction-goals">low friction goals are an advantage</a> over "high friction" goals.</p>
<p>This is just another way of saying "easy things are easier to do than harder things". Revelatory, I know.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="http://josh.works/blog/2013/05/03/intentional-habit-building">I wrote a long time ago that</a>:</p>
<blockquote>We tell ourselves we can't accomplish goals because we don't have enough motivation, but this is far too simple of an explanation... it must be useful to fail during your attempt, and you must not try very hard.</blockquote>
<p>In other words, big grand goals are great, but expect that you will not successfully execute on them all. Plan to fail the primary task, and in doing so, you'll gain information that will make your second attempt that much better.</p>
<p>I don't know that I've learned a lot from the things I've failed to execute on. I certainly have not reduced the size and scope of my projects, but I'm getting a bit more thoughtful about them. For example, I'm working now in 30 day chunks. A project (like budgeting) is much more approachable when you're doing it for just 29 or 30 days.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's part of what this writing has been about. I had a lot in my head I wanted to get out, so I said "I'll publish something every day, and I won't queue anything in advance."</p>
<p>I'm writing, my idea-muscles are getting some exercise, and I'm laying a foundation for my next projects. Hopefully, throughout it all, I'll be able to share useful things.</p>
<p>All in all, a good use of a few minutes every day.</p>

I wrote the following in an email to `publiccomment@cityofgolden.net`, but I have no idea if/where it will be made public, so re-posting here.

**Subject: I'm generally disappointed with the discourse I've observed to date**

Hi there, city council and staff,

I've lived in Golden since 2014, my wife and I managed to buy a house in 2020, on Iowa St[^the-color-of-law].

[^the-color-of-law]: My wife and I have "good" jobs, so banks were happy to lend us horrific amounts of money to afford our 70 year old house that's litterally falling to pieces. It cost half a million dollars. Please see [The Color of Law: A Forgotten History of How Our Government Segregated America](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32191706-the-color-of-law)

I've attended many meetings, and noticed that for people who live in the city, there is an obsession with what the city staff or council are doing/not doing, for understandable reasons. The entire city is dependent upon the decisions of city staff, planning commission, and council.

The city is extremely expensive to live in, and the road networks don't function very well or safely for anyone.

The way the city solicits 'public input' is hilariously biased, full of micromanagement, and obviously doesn't lead to useful outcomes.

The city staff perpetuate issues that harm everyone by failing to recognize the origins of bad policies that cripple progress and real growth. I don't expect the average resident to be an expert in municipal zoning codes, and the complicated histories therein, but I expect the staff and city council to know these things.

## Zoning is far more complicated and insidious than it claims to be

Zoning, for example, as exists in America, was created by politically powerful ethnic groups to maintain social control and physical separation over other ethnic groups; "urban renewal" was the excuse cities used to enact regimes of ethnic cleansing against 'undesirable' ethnic minorities.

> The zone plan drafted by Whitten and unpublished by the Atlanta City Planning Commission in 1922 explained that “race zoning is essential in the interest of the public peace, order and security and will promote the welfare and prosperity of both the white and colored race.” The zoning law divided the city into an “R-I white district” and “R-2 colored district” with additional neighborhoods undetermined (Rothstein 2017) [source](https://blackfeminisms.com/zoning/)

This zone plan the document references is _intense_. I've written extensively about Whitten's plan [here](https://josh.works/full-copy-of-1922-atlanta-zone-plan).

Golden still has R1 and R2 neighborhoods. They're not labeled "white" and "colored", anymore, but the original intent lives on. I live in an R2 neighborhood. Guess where the roads are full of fast traffic, where the pollution and road noise is the worst, the sidewalks the narrowest, and where there are the fewest parks?

R2 neighborhoods. 

I invite you to look at page 10 of [this document](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435003851870&view=1up&seq=12&skin=2021), to read the race zoning language directly, as it was written in 1922.

I desire for the city to move into the modern world when it comes to managing "itself".

During the rezoning meetings, when the city was telling the residents of my R2 north-golden neighborhood what the new 'form-based zoning' rules were going to be, I couldn't help but notice that most of the attendees of the meeting where from r1 neighborhoods, there to make sure that the new zoning plan wouldn't apply to their homes.

I asked Rick if he was aware of the race-based heritage of zoning in the USA, and he seemed uncertain.

Furthermore, road networks (and minimum parking requirements) are the primary justification/tool for urban renewal, which was used in American in the 50s, 60s, and 70s for ethnic cleansing.

Here's how Wikipedia defines ethnic cleansing:

> Ethnic cleansing is the systematic forced removal of ethnic, racial, and religious groups from a given area, with the intent of making a region ethnically [homogeneous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity). Along with direct removal, extermination, [deportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation) or [population transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_transfer), it also includes indirect methods aimed at [forced migration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_displacement) by coercing the victim group to flee and preventing its return, such as murder, rape, and property destruction.

So, to say that urban renewal has been used for ethnic cleansing in America, I'm making the charge that institutions in America have engaged in actions synonymous with rape, genocide, starvation, and war.

I invite anyone to obtain a copy of [The Slaughter of Cities: Urban Renewal as Ethnic Cleansing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2023854.The_Slaughter_of_Cities) by E Michael Jones, or borrow my copy.

I won't be party to ongoing perpetuation of the injustices that decimated Denver, Golden, Lakewood, and every city in America in the 20th century.

I'd rather participate in a system that unwinds the evil plans worked by powerful people who embedded their views of the world in systems which hum along long after these evil people have died.

It's too late to undo the evil acts that befell millions across the country, at the hands of politically powerful, racially-motivated ethnic groups. But we can start making a new path.

Incidentally, the new path will bring about a more pleasant, beautiful, well-running city. It will be a home to more people, and will hum with more life. There will be less "bad things" and more "good things".

The things the city seems to be spending its time on are not related to the things the city should be spending its time on. The easiest set of next steps would be to legislatively remove every piece of municipal code and statute that relates to regimes of ethnic cleansing and social control.

Incidentally, the people who perpetuated ethnic cleansing had deeply broken and warped views of the world (duh! They believed in things like [phrenology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrenology) and other forms of [scientific racism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism). They were basically the flat-earthers of social science.)

They couldn't quite come out and say:

> we want to pass laws that cause the destruction of ethnic neighborhoods,

they had to say things like

> in pursuit of maintenance of property values, we will make illegal many things associated with the ways of life of ethnic minorities

or

> we will prioritize the things associated with the ways of life of the wealthy

because these groups of evil people had access to more wealth than the minorities they targeted.

For example, since car ownership was associated with income, and income is a proxy for wealth, any legislation/regulation that prioritized cars, or any federal dollars obtained to build car infrastructure, supported their goals of advancing their way of life at the expense of the way of life of other ethnic groups.

This is why I have very little patience for urban planning experts who don't instantly recognize the vast harm wrought by 'minimum parking requirements' and an unwillingness to make the streets safe/efficient/effective for all users.[^most-vulnerable-first]

The good news is as soon as we drop the crappy old paradigm

[most-vulnerable-first]: Current road networks are inadequate, _even for drivers_. That's the topic of another blog post, but the roads are bad. [Jonathan Stalls](https://www.instagram.com/pedestriandignity/?hl=en) lives in Denver, and talks about inadequate road networks regularly. [Here's a profile of him in Mashable](https://mashable.com/article/pedestrian-dignity-transportation-accessibility). "safe enough" roads can be used safely by children, or disabled people, or the elderly, in all conditions, like: at night, in the rain, in the snow.

<p>I met two people yesterday from Colorado, while in Spain. We climbed together yesterday and today, and Kristi and I had dinner with them.</p>
<p>Half way through the meal, I asked my all-time favorite question:</p>
<blockquote>If you could go back to twenty five year old you, and tell yourself anything, knowing it was coming from future you, what would you say? (And where were you living/what were you doing as a twenty five year old.)</blockquote>
<p>I've asked this of probably a hundred people, and <em>always</em> get an interesting answer.</p>
<p>Want to know why I'm asking?</p>
<p>I'm 27. Having 100 people reflect on what they'd tell a younger version of themselves is a pretty good way to learn things.</p>
<p>Now, I don't recall many specific answers. Usually it segways into a larger conversation. Few people have concise, ready answers.</p>
<p>But if I did have a ready-made list of answers that were really insightful and a little irrelevant, I think it would look a lot like this list: <a href="https://medium.com/life-learning/40-things-about-life-i-wish-i-could-travel-back-in-time-and-tell-myself-e52f2effa3ab#.vm6s6w33h"><em>40 things about life I wish I could travel back in time and tell myself</em></a></p>
<p>How about you?</p>
<p>If you could tell your twenty five year old self anything, what would it be? (If you're younger than twenty eight, the question changes to "if you could tell your twenty <em>one</em> year old self anything...")</p>
<h2>You should ask this question of those around you</h2>
<p dir="ltr">This is a weighty question. Usually, when I ask someone, they say "hm. That's a good question..." and then they're quiet for a moment. They think, a lot. And their answer paves the way to great conversation, in addition to being useful in its own right.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sometimes they thank me for the question. It's a good way to show someone that you're listening to them, and interested in them. These are good things.</p>

# The Junctions

Today, I drove and walked with my daughter in several different parts of Denver. 

I track my location and mobility data quite closely. ([more closely than you do, I promise](https://joshs-mobility-data-54dab943ebba.herokuapp.com/))

I could write a book or give a seminar on subtlty around 'choosing a path through an intersection, based on judgements on:

- your own vehicle class 
- the class of the other relevant vehicles
- what country you're in
- the shape of the intersection (as from an overhead maps view)
- the shape of the intersection (is it flat or banked or cambered? often intersections can be thought of as )
- the material(s) in the intersection (asphalt or concrete? broken or smooth? is there paint on any of the part of the intersection where I'll be turning? manhole covers? seams in the asphalt?)
- time of day and weather condition considerations
- and I'm boring even myself listing various factors, but needless to say, intersection navigation is ✨complicated✨

It was with great anger and resentment, that I had to travel around _obviously dangerous streets_ where I was trying my hardest to get us safely to our destination.

I'll google

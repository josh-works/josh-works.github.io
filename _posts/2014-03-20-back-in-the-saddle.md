There's a point in time when after spending a few weeks or months working on one project/goal, your ability to switch tasks to another project diminishes.

There's plenty of evidence that humans can't multi-task, and those who try just end up doing a lot of things poorly.

On the flip side, if you're working on a project, being familiar with it allows you to hold the whole thing in your head. If you put it down for two months, when you come back you have to refamiliarize yourself with the project.

Over the last few months, I've been on a low-level job hunt. A job hunt (if your me) is mentally draining. Not exhausting, but it took enough of my energy that I put my active side projects on the back burner. Writing regularly being one of those side projects.

### Big News

This low-level job hunt has ended. I am happy to announce that I'm joining 
[Litmus](https://litmus.com/) as a customer successÂ advocate. This opportunity is really exciting because:

* I get to work with really talented people
* The specifics of my role is 
exactly how I've been developing my skills at my last job with 
[Razoo](http://razoo.com).
* This allows me to refocus energy on doing really good work (at Litmus) and building out my side projects.

This new role allows a number of key pieces to fall into place in other areas of my life.

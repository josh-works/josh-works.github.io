<h1>RESOURCES FOR PEOPLE WITH JOBS</h1>
<p>You spend most of your waking hours at work. So, spend a few of those waking hours when you're <em>not</em> at work thinking about how to improve the hours that you <em>are</em> working. Often, improving your work means you can improve your work conditions and compensation.</p>
<p>Many people in their 20s feel stagnant in their job(s). Don't let that be you.</p>
<p>Here's a list of useful resources. I'll update this occasionally.</p>
<blockquote><p>Why this list of books, Josh? Why not just write "the best career advice ever! #7 will amazing you!" and call it a day?</p></blockquote>
<p>Because<em> I don't know things</em>. I've stumbled into some things that seem to work, and along the way encountered many things that seem not to work. </p>
<p>I'm not able to evaluate my own experience and detangle my decisions from happenstance. So I choose to not play the game of offering advice, and instead point you to people who DO have useful things to say.</p>
<p>I promise, your time is well spent with these authors:</p>

I had plans, and it's felt like at this moment in time, _most of them are failing/have failed_. Here's a list, and if you see yourself as one of the affected persons, please know I am genuinely sorry!

I've had some things that have felt very avoidable, and very unavoidable, go wrong. In all cases, it _feels_ like I'm completely to blame, and I feel big senses of guilt and having failed other people in really meaningful ways.

I know that not all of these are completely my fault, and our failures don't define us, and it's okay to make mistakes

The worst is when it feels like my _efforts to help_ literally make things _much worse_. Or, through sheer callousness or cluelessness, I cause someone else real inconvenience and harm.

I'm getting a bit expansive here - these don't all cause me equal pain (thank god) and some of these failures might be a bit tongue in cheek. Levity helps when things hurt.

### A long list of ways I've failed, mistakes I've made

_again, it's cathartic to get things on paper. I might well be overly self-centered (see below) but I've historically been comfortable 'baring my soul'. And we've read (with complete boredom, mild disinterest, and rapt attention) other people's stories of their own failures.


1. I've tried to help many people, in a variety of ways. Folks going through Turing, or otherwise entering the software development industry. I have absolutely felt like I've made errors, or failed to provide some bit of help that really could have made a difference, and to the degree the person experiences less-good outcomes, I feel responsible. I've definately been successful in helping folks, and many people would have no idea that anything has gone wrong for anyone.
1. my marriage. Feels like I really, really failed people I wanted to do nothing but love really well. And either I don't understand why, or I couldn't prevent it, or I'm an inhumane clueless monster/narcicist doomed to re-make all the same mistakes my dad made, no matter how badly I want to not do that.
1. my family. No matter how things go, we'll always be in each other's life, and to the degree that I cause them pain, in justified and unjustified ways, I certainly feel some burden for that.

## 648 Iowa St

My god. Lets talk about this. I ended up "buying" a family out of getting evicted, because they didn't have any options for where to go. I committed to making the rent gap that was filled by some departing tenants (as the tenants left, the problems leading to the landlord wanting to get rid of the property were going away).

My LinkedIn bio says "software developer". I was unemployed at the time, when I started this project, but had just received two job offers (that, in hind sight, I should have taken the other one) that came in at $120k.

I felt like I'd be able to float $1600/mo for a while. My last job was making $5800/mo (post tax) and Kristi was working too, of course.

We'd just purchased an _expensive_ house, the mortgage was not cheap, but we wanted to be invested in the neighborhood, I didn't want the properties across the street to be torn down (the tenants evicted), etc.

A point of constant tension between Kristi and I has been that I've wanted to be _deeply invested_ in the neighborhood, and try to make various projects be fun and work out. This has been in my mind the inspiration for the parties we used to host, the donuts and coffee neighborhood gatherings we'd organize, and the shared meals with friends we generally enjoyed participating in.

Years ago, we read books like [A Severe Mercy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56594.A_Severe_Mercy?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=jd4hhefMEV&rank=1) and [The Gospel Comes with a House Key](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36384252-the-gospel-comes-with-a-house-key?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=WXFtlZdLbg&rank=1), and I'd understood our house and the way we wanted to go about our lives as being coherent with some of the themes expressed in those books. (There are many beautiful themes, regardless of how you feel about the religious influence of those books.)

Very early in the process, Kristi had said something like:

> Do whatever you want, but don't you dare spend money on them!

(in anger, aggressively, and as she 'shut down the conversation'). She maintained a similar defensiveness and kept me away as I went through the following days and weeks of conversations with the involved parties, trying to see if there was a way to keep this eviction from going through.

I'm aware of our earning power, our privilege. We've spent (semi-casually) up to $6k on gifts/donations in the pass (one-off), and regularly spent thousands of dollars in a given month helping others. So, this commitment felt pretty on-brand, and I saw a ton of ways that it could have worked out great.

See, I'm deeply interested in the 'dynamics' of how cities work, and totally saw the events as just another instance of an oppressive system chewing through all the involved parties to destructive ends.

I jumped in, halted the eviction, and every time this house came up, Kristi gave me icy silence and said hurtful things about it. Acted like I was spending on hookers and cocaine, instead of trying to keep three adults and a child from losing their house.

I believe that, in general, if people take steps to care for their immediate family and immediate neighbors, that is the right thing to do.

_I've found myself married to someone who is not interested in taking steps to care for immediate family and neighbors_.


## A long sabbatical to try to 'start something'

Phew. This feels like the biggest failure. I quit my last full-time job as Covid was breaking out. I'd had a bunch of plans for what the sabbatical would look like, none of them worked out, and I failed to re-build good plans. I kept floating along on the path of least resistence, and trying to make certain things work.

I gave Turing a proposal to work hard on their ruby-exercises repositories, to help students self-serve into a higher degree of readiness for the program. Early results for the free work I'd done for them, and the paid work I did for them, was extremely promising. For a variety of reasons, it didn't work out, and in a way that hurt. Either I keep getting myself involved with unhealthy organizations, or I have this massive blind spot to how I come off to others, and keep stepping on toes in a really visible and obvious way, like walking around with toilet paper trailing from your shoe.

After Turing, I kept trying other projects. I learned a ton, and I'm willing to throw myself into nearly anything, but I kept not hitting a sustainable mix of "getting paid enough and regularly" and "doing reasonable amounts of sales work to get new clients".

I was also in the midst of being verbally abused by Kristi nearly daily, and felt my hope and optimism and confidence and sense of joy and playfulness being slowly stripped from me. As failure/success got laden with conditional approval (and shame) from Kristi, because I wasn't able to recognize it as such, I just kept sliding, and toiling away from a position of sadness, depression, and loneliness.

## A house and investing in the community

We bought an old, crappy house (from 1955) with tons of old house problems. I thought Kristi and I were going to work on it together, playing music, hanging out, enjoying time and work on something important to our family and each other.

Instead, I got extreme anger, a refusal to work together, and pretty negative emotional energy at every step of the way. I am responsible for the projects I undertook, but until this point in my life, Kristi and I had pursued projects in a _shared_ way, with positive emotional energy around it.

I kept being caught by surprise, as there was negligence, frustration, and anger being poured out. I absorbed so much of the stress that Kristi was projecting into the environment around her. I eventually ended up feeling simultaneously useless, incompetent, unlikable, unworthy to be helped, and devoid of interesting or beautiful visions for the future, based on how Kristi was treating me. Eventually I had to realize these cannot all be true, and started taking steps to not feel these things so strongly.

This is a huge failure. It felt like Kristi was treating the aspects of the house I was most excited about (a backyard garden, hosting friends, parties, playing games, reading books together in the morning on our back porch) with disinterest or shame, and that led to me feeling like I needed to 'hide' these interests of mine from her, to keep the peace in the relationship. Hiding those things did _not_ keep the peace, and made me feel much worse, as I tried to become a version of someone that would be less triggering to her than I was.

I've failed with the house, and with what I'd wanted to do in the community.

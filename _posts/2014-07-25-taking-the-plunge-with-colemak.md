This entire post is written in 
[Colemak](http://colemak.com/).
I am aiming to write at least 100 words, and this is certainly harder than copying someone else's words.



I have completed a few hours of dedicated practice, and it is quite possible that I am jumping the gun, and will quickly revert to QWERTY. I intend to finish work tomorrow in QWERTY, and then spend the weekend practicing hard, and stay in Colemak all next week.



I will be honest. This seems like I am biting off more than I can chew. Don't laugh, but from when I started typing to now, almost ten minutes have elapsed. I need to double my speed (and accuracy) by Monday if I want to have any hope of doing this.



Protip: If changing keyboard layouts, change your password to just numbers and symbols. It is hard to get passwords right when you cannot rely on muscle memory 
orsight. And embarrassing when you just can't get it...

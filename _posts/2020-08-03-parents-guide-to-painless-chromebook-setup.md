I spent a few hours recently helping my 75-year-old mother-in-law reconnect her junky old Windows laptop to the internet. Across five phone calls, and many pictures of her computer screen, we got her internet working again. 

As I did this, I live-tweeted the experience:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My mother in law is frustrated that her internet wasn&#39;t working today. It&#39;s been broken all day. I&#39;ve called her a few times between other events to try to help debug it. <br><br>This is a screenshot I just received (via email) that she took *with her phone* <a href="https://t.co/5KnfCGZ2F4">pic.twitter.com/5KnfCGZ2F4</a></p>&mdash; Josh Thompson (@josh_works) <a href="https://twitter.com/josh_works/status/1290420667444338688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

Part of the debugging process involved her taking pictures of her computer screen, because I couldn't tell what she was looking at. (I don't ever use a Windows operating system, so I was operating blind.)

She was frustrated with it all, so I'd first suggested plugging-in/unplugging the router. It would be easier to walk her through that then the unfamiliar OS. 

After it didnt work (and hours passed) we did this back and forth. She took a picture and emailed it to me.

It took a few minutes to arrive, then I'd look at it, tell her what to click, and wait for another screenshot:

about 15 minutes and another phone call later, I got this:

All she ended up needing was to click her home wifi network and connect to it, per these screenshots. 

Months ago, I'd read things like:

- [Secure browsing for elderly: chromebook or Windows 10 S (reddit)](https://www.reddit.com/r/chromeos/comments/h82m1d/secure_browsing_for_elderly_chromebook_or_windows/)
- [A chromebook for elderly people (reddit)](https://www.reddit.com/r/chromeos/comments/cdgq1q/a_chromebook_for_elderly_people/)
- [People who bought a Chromebook for an elderly or tech illiterate parent/relative, what has yours and their experience been so far? (reddit, five years old! ðŸ˜­)](https://www.reddit.com/r/chromeos/comments/34v0w2/people_who_bought_a_chromebook_for_an_elderly_or/)

On this last one, read through this answer:

> I convinced my wife and her two brothers to purchase the Asus Chromebox for their mother this past December for Christmas.
> 
> She had been complaining about how slow her desktop had been for years. Every year we all put money together to update something electronic for her. One year it was a camera, then she lost that camera (lol) so we got her another the next year. Then it was a Bluray player. The computer had been on the list for years.
> 
> In my family and circle's I am the "go to person" to fix computer or technology related problems. I never gave my self that title but unfortunately for me I'm stuck with it.
> 
> I don't know about you but I can't count how many times I've been asked to "fix", "speed up", or "I think I might have a virus, my computer is so slow can you take a look at it". What I have found over the years is that almost always there isn't a virus. The fix for all of those problems more times than not is you need a new machine. Your Sh** is old. And honestly I just grew tired of getting this from so many "tech illiterate" people.
> 
> Windows (I can't speak for Mac) is a pain to maintain. There are a lot of people who would say otherwise but unless you find that sort of thing easy, it just is.
> 
> So with all that (hopefully funny backstory) said I wanted to get my mother in law a Chrome device. And like I said we got the Asus Chromebox.
> 
> Let me tell you, it is by far my mother in laws favorite device we ever got her. We got it off of Amazon on black Friday. We paid $119.99 US and I bought an extra stick of ram from corsair I believe. That would upgrade the ram from 2gb to 4gb.
> 
> She no longer has a slow computer. It boots up in less than 10 seconds. Everything is saved and synced. No windows updates. No fragmented hard drives. No virus/malware. She can still play solitare via a chrome store app. It plays video's great when she sees them while looking at her facebook. The browser doesn't lag and isn't slow. ChomeOS updates automatically and is seamless. I know a lot of people that had their windows machines freeze while on a windows update. Essentially making their computer a brick, until someone like me comes and fixes it for them. If ChromeOS ever gets into trouble, it is as simple as doing a "powerwash" which is basically a factory reset and everything goes back to new. But since everything in ChromeOS is synced, as soon as you log back in everything is restored just how it was.
> 
> Chromebooks/boxes come with at least 100gb of online storage and Drive is "mounted" in chromeOS it's self so it acts just like if it were a hard drive in the computer. ChromeOS is incredibly simple. There aren't a lot of options menus. You can't get lost in the OS.
> 
> ChromeOS I would argue is amazing for tech illiterate people. I'm far from tech illiterate but ChromeOS has been an absolute breath of fresh air for me as well! There really isn't much of a learning curve, outside of understanding how to install/remove a chrome app or extension.
> 
> There are, however, some take-aways. For one you can not install any software like you would on windows or mac. There is one program my mother in law uses and I have found no way of a work around for her and the chromebox. Skype is not available right out of the box for ChromeOS. There is a a work around but requires using a program to convert the Android Version to work in ChromeOS.
> 
> I have lots more I could say, but I'm getting the evil eye from the wife, time to get off of Reddit!
> 
> I can't recommend a Chromebook/Box more, especially for non tech folks. And is wonderful for us who have to run tech support. Makes our job so much easier! I tell people to first examine their primary needs and research if they can be met with ChromeOS, before buying. Understand it's limitations. If you go into it knowing exactly what you are getting, then it is a wonderful experience.
> 
> I ended up convincing her in the course of the call to upgrade to a Chromebook! 

I'm sold. I just have to re-invent the wheel and figure out how much I need to spend, etc.

**I need to figure out what Chromebook to get her, set it up for her, and help her be successful with it. This can easily take many hours. I want my effort to be helpful to you.**

Later that day, here's what happened:

So, I've got a lot of the questions I'll need answered jotted down, and I wanna see if there's any interest in buying a guide like this. Would it be worth $10 to you? $100? $1000? 

In the pole, someone expressed it might be worth as much as $2000, so I am including that option below.

Maybe it's worth $1000 but you don't even have $5 to spend to acquire the guide. Whatever I end up creating, I'll make available to you. 

Here's the spec sheet of the guide, as it exists in my head right now:

## An outline of what I'll build and get to you:

I decided that, for the both of us, we needed to get her a Chromebook. I'm convincing her, and I'm going to write a detailed guide.


### Questions I'll answer

- When I recognized it was the right time to actually take action
- How I phrased the pain-points so she would agree that it was a problem
- How I used the time I spent debugging her problems convincing her that she should use a different type of laptop
- what actual machine to buy
- how to set up an account for your parent
- how to handle them using a non-gmail account (I assume this is a requirement)
- how to take remote access of the machine and accomplish tasks yourself. (This beats your mother-in-law emailing you cell phone pictures.)
- her reactions and first-run experience with my documented process
- how I tweak my plans based on her responses
- how to use all of this information to aid your own parents through a similar process

### The benefits you will receive from this guide
- Help your parent(s) feel a sense of dignity and control through this process, even though it might feel like it's displacing an important, familiar thing needlessly
- Remove a point of frustration that might be emotionally charged, thanks to issues related to maintaining competence and control over one's affairs. (I suspect I'll be looking for a `step-by-step guide to helping your aging parents stop driving` soon)
- how to help your parent(s) use as much Gmail as they have to, while most likely using their primary email address with an `AOL` or `yahoo` or `comcast` email account. (and they get tons of spam in it)
- How to handle a password manager with them. Use or don't use Chrome/Firefox password tools?
- Oh, 1Password? If you use 1Password, and have your parent's credentials in a 1Password vault that is shared with your siblings and/or in-laws, but you're the one who manages that account, what should you do? 
- the above presumes that you came to have your parent's credentials _at their request_, how should you handle that?
- once it's set up, can it be easy enough to set up that they can unbox it themselves?
- how much does it cost to ship a laptop through the mail, anyway? Is it safe? Legal?
- Is it _actually_ possible to "easily" "remote in" and "fix things" for your parents? The reader might be skeptical of how "easy and simple" software often is, and is curious to know exactly what to expect.
- An example to point to, when convincing your parent to take the plunge. 

> Look, this guide is from this guy on the internet that did _this exact same thing with his mother-in-law who was similar to you because {reasons}_, and look at this quote here where she says how thankful is she did this thing:
>
>> Hi, I'm Barb, and since I switched to this chromebook thing I spend 20 extra minuts a day facetiming with my grandkids! I love that!

## Do not purchase if... (sorta an "anti-FAQ")

- If your parents are familiar with the Apple ecosystem, because I have always used Android and MacOS, don't have an iPad or an iPhone. I feel strongly inclined to do MacOS.
- If you don't want to use a Chromebook or learn a Windows operating system
- You expect a perfectly-polished, high-production-value product

# FAQ

## What all is included

Not exactly sure, but a detailed guide. Annotated screenshots, links, all that stuff. 

Might do video walk-throughs. [Here's an example of how I do these](https://josh.works/mythical-creature-refactor-ogre).

## What if I want my money back

Then I 100% wanna give it to you. Just let me know and I'll send it right back, all fees included, between now and forever. 

## I might want the $100, or $500, or $2000 verison, but don't know yet.

Yeah, totally get it. I'd say pop your email address into the $0 form, and reply to one of the emails when you feel so inclined. 

## I have other questions I'd like to ask you

Great! Pop your email in below; the very first email you'll get asks:

> I'd really love to know what prompted your interest. Are you going through something similar right now? Do you think you might be doing something like this soon? Any advice or words of caution that you'd share?

As questions pop up, I'll update this document accordingly.

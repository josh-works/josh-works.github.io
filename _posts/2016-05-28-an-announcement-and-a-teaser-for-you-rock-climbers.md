In case you didn't guess, or you guessed wrong...


I'm shooting tons of video for a course. It's going to be awesome. It's a work-in-progress, so read along 
[HERE](http://www.climbersguide.co/conquer-fear-course/) to follow along.

you can resolve this anxiety completely, and unleash your inner crusher. This will make both of us really happy.

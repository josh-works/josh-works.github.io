A while back I got together with my good friend <a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556694eee4b0f4ca9cd56729/5586fe4be4b0278244ce9f01/5586fe9ee4b0278244ceab71/1434910366219/?format=original">Dustin</a>. I had an evening free, wanted to cook, AND hang out with good friends. I wanted to try a <a href="http://www.sixsistersstuff.com/2013/01/slow-cooker-maple-and-brown-sugar-pork.html">really good looking recipe</a>, and watch Django Unchained.</p>
<p>The cooking instructions for the recipe was "cook on low for 7-9 hours". I did some mental math. If I turn it on as I'm walking out the door to work, at 8:15, and get back by 5:30, that could work. I'll have to run some errands on my way home, but if I had 10% to the cook time, it can't be terrible, right?"<!--more--></p>
<p>Well... it turns out I was gone more like 10.5 hours, and my crock pot's <em>low</em> temperature setting is a little higher than<em>Â </em>expected.</p>
<p>I got home about 40 minutes before Dustin was to arrive, and something didn't smell quite right. I popped open the crock pot, and saw some <em>very</em> dry, <em>very</em> warm meat. It was 175 degrees. So much for not overdoing it.</p>
<p>We got take-out from Tara Thai. Zero harm, zero disappointment, and we had a great time.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The lesson</strong></p>
<p>The biggest take away for me had nothing to do with cooking. (I already knew that cooking a piece of meat for almost 11 hours is usually a bad idea.)</p>
<p>I could have freaked out when I got home and immediately learned that my dinner plans were ruined. I would have been stressed, and probably a little angry. I wasn't. This was a learning experience, and I love Thai food, so I learned, and we ate Thai.</p>
<p>My learned lesson was this: <em>A good backup plan allows for one to try hard, and even fail, with very few repercussions.</em> There was nothing to freak out about, because dinner was not ruined. It was simply modified. We went from pot roast to cashew chicken with a phone call.</p>
<p>A few days later I tried the roast again. After it was rescued from the crock pot at an appropriate time, it was delicious.</p>
<p><em>Failure can be made safe, and therefore stripped of all those annoying negative associations.
</em></p>

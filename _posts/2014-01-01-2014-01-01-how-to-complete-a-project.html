<p>Most of us have goals. And we usually don't reach any of them.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">Minimum Viable Product</a> "concept" has helped me with some goals, and it could be helpful to you.</p>
<p>It's a simple concept: When starting something new, figure out what the minimum investment would get you the required return.</p>
<p>Here's how it played out for me in the last few weeks:</p>
<p>I've wanted to write a book about lead climbing, and how to deal with fear. It was so daunting of a project, I put off any progress for a long time, and then once I <em>did</em> start making progress, I easily sidetracked myself down a thousand different rabbit trails.</p>
<p>The only time I have made progress was when focusing on the <em>minimum</em> required investment, and what next step would get me there.</p>
<p>I am far from done, but it's gotten me this far.</p>
<p>Check out www.belaybetter.com to see the results of this particular project. You can download a sample chapter for free, and of course, buy the book if you're interested.</p>

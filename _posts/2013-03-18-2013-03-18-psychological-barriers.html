<p>I recently took a HUGE step in my career. It marked a turning point, when I went to "old Josh" to "new Josh".
It happened in a day. A click, really.</p>
<p>What was this step?</p>
<p>I sent an email.</p>
<p><strong>Prolonging the inevitable, for as long as possible.</strong></p>
<p>I'm a business consultant, you see. I help businesses improve their relationships with their customers, to build trust and reduce "friction". I have a lot of ideas and can see areas where small improvements would lead to big change.</p>
<p>At that point, I had no clients.</p>
<p>I have spent weeks and months thinking about consulting. I've read blogs and books about it. I've visited local businesses and walked away with a list of changes they could make that would ease their customer acquisition process, increase the lifetime value of the customer, and possibly even cut costs for the business. All these things increase revenues by either generating additional income or decreasing costs.</p>
<p>I've done everything I can do to equip myself to consult except for one small step.</p>
<p><em>I have not offered my services to any business.</em></p>
<p>That changed Thursday, January 10, 2013. I had not heard back from them, but I sent an email. I don't know if anyone will read it. It probably won't turn into work. I'll be lucky if I hear back from them when they say "No thanks".</p>
<p><em>None of that matters.</em></p>
<p>If I've reached out to one business, I can reach out to five. Or ten. If I have a useful product (I do) eventually it will stick. Once it does, my life will have changed.</p>
<p><strong>I avoided reaching out to a real-life, honest-to-god businesses because I feared failure<em>.</em></strong></p>
<p>I changed my perspective. My goal is to now accumulate rejections, not consulting gigs. I redefined success so that reaching out to a business is only part of my goal; regardless of what they tell me, or if they tell me anything, I haveÂ succeeded.</p>

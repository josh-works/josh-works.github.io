<p>I'm not here to talk about Twitter and Instagram, which... I use too much. Lets talk about things that make my life better, and might do the same for you.</p>
<p>(If you're an iPhone user, just Google for the iOS version of the following tools. They're all out there)</p>
<h2 id="rewire-app-recurring-behavior-tracking">Rewire App: "Recurring behavior" tracking</h2>
<p>I wrote "Habit tracking" originally, but I don't like that phrasing. I'm all for good habits, or eliminating bad ones, but I don't think you should try to form a new habit until you've figured out <a href="http://josh.works/blog/2013/05/03/intentional-habit-building">how to make it really, really easy</a>. </p>
<p>So, I use <a href="http://www.rewireapp.io/" title="Rewire App">Rewire</a> to simply track the status of things I'd like to pay attention too. <em>I'm not trying to make new habits</em>. I just want to see how often I do something on its own.</p>
<p>When I do the thing I want to do, I mark that day's habit as "complete". If I don't, I don't mark it as "failed", I just mark it as "skipped". This is a tiny way I can <a href="http://josh.works/blog/2014/07/19/be-gentle-to-you">be gentle to myself</a>.</p>
<h2 id="journey-app-daily-gratitude">Journey App: Daily gratitude</h2>
<p>I write a little  bit every day. Three things every day, and never with the intention of publishing them.</p>
<p>Between <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Slight-Edge-Turning-Disciplines-Massive/dp/193594486X">The Slight Edge</a></em> and _<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Miracle-Morning-Not-So-Obvious-Guaranteed-Transform-ebook/dp/B00AKKS278/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1467616556&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=micracle+morning">The Miracle Morning</a>_ and many other books, and endless articles, I've finally been convinced about the benefit of finding a few things every day to be thankful for. Three things, specifically.</p>
<p>For a long time I used <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-keep-notes-and-lis/hmjkmjkepdijhoojdojkdfohbdgmmhki?hl=en">Google Keep</a> to track all my items, but it became laggy once I had a few hundred lines of text in it. So, I hunted around, and found <a href="http://2appstudio.com/journey/" title="Journey App">Journey</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://2appstudio.com/journey/" title="Journey App">Journey</a> is an Android (and windows) app + Chrome extension for "daily journaling". I just open it up (usually on my phone, as I go to sleep, other times on the Chrome extension) and I jot down three things I'm thankful for. </p>
<p>The only rules are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Always three things</li>
<li>No repeats</li>
</ol>
<p>I enjoy having to be a little creative to make sure I don't repeat things, and it's really encouraging to scroll down through hundreds of little tiny (and sometimes big) things I was (and am) thankful for. </p>
<h2 id="phoneusage-don-t-waste-your-life">PhoneUsage: Don't waste your life</h2>
<p>Apparently, no one has heard of this app. Lifehacker, CNET, Gizmodo, and others all have pretty terrible recommendations for apps that tell you how much you use your phone. I'd know - I tried what they recommended, was frustrated, and then finally found <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pt.aguiar.phoneusage" title="PhoneUsage App">PhoneUsage</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pt.aguiar.phoneusage">PhoneUsage</a> does exactly what you'd expect: </p>
<ul>
<li>Tells you how much total time you spend with your phone "on". (I use quotes because talking on the phone counts, even though the screen is off.)</li>
<li>Tells you how many times you turned your screen on (total #sessions, and also the number of "quick checks". I don't know how it qualifies one from the other.)</li>
<li>How much you use each app</li>
<li>Lots more. </li>
</ul>
<p>I love it. I look at it at least once a day, sometimes more. I think it helps me subtly move towards less frivolous time spent on my phone. </p>

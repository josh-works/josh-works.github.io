The pressure to be working on more than one thing at a time is enormous. This pressure comes from no one but me. And before I dismiss this tendency as "proof that I work too hard", I must take another tact. It comes from a need to satisfy my ego. It is much easier to say "I did not finish that because I got distracted by another project" than "I did not finish because I gave up" or "it was too hard."
My enthusiasm carries me through the opening stages of any project, but quickly wanes. Now is what separates the men from the boys.



There is a lot on 
[The List](https://josh-thompson-f385.squarespace.com/epic-quest). Nothing of substance will be accomplished without focus.



Along the lines of focus: this post was written in Colemak. I did not time it, but it was much less frustrating than yesterday.

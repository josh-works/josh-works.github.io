I've been "catching up" a _lot_ in my life lately. Some of that catching up involves bringing up to speed various people I've not spoken too (or spoken too _much_, or _openly_, or _recently_, or _ever_, or some combination thereof).

I am strongly biased towards written/editable/consistent versions of "what's going on", because then:

1. everyone has some confidence in at least some shared context
2. Thinking how this reads for the various audiences has a useful clarifying effect on the writing.
3. [I believe in writing things when they're being experienced]({{site.base_url}}{% link _posts/2021-10-05-write-it-now.md %}), especially as a tool to capture insights, learnings, etc.
4. the act of writing tends to have a great ordering effect on the meaning we assign to our own stories.
5. I've historically written a lot, trying to "unblock the writing blockages", so taking a stab at writing about "the most important things", ordered `DESC`.
6. I could imagine that some of what I might write could be helpful to someone else. There's analogous writings that software developers perceive as very conventional for their craft. Incident reports, retrospectives, etc.

## TL;DR Depression & Decline

For several years, from an "overall health-and-wellbeing of Josh & Kristi Thompson", things have been sliding, in different ways, downhill.

Sometimes the decline was fast, sometimes slow. Sometimes in terms of physical health, sometimes in terms of mental health. Sometimes both!

There's been a tough mix of totally unavoidable, and totally avoidable, tragedy.

I historically would have self-assessed my marriage as in many real ways once as "quite good" and lately would self-assess as "quite bad".[^third-parties]

[^third-parties]: I believe in general a third-party observer would agree with both assessments - and third parties _have_ agreed. I'm generally leery of using third parties to bolster arguments, in the off chance it's a rhetorical device instead something genuinely helpful to contribute, but there are situations where it could be construed as relevant.

Things are trending upwards again[^what-that-means], but there have been a lot of changes or deviations from what would have once been normal for us.

[^what-that-means]: I know, that's nebulous. Feel free to circle around with an IRL conversation/email/WhatsApp voice message/whatever. As I'm getting a better handle on what's going on (this write-up is a piece of that) I'm getting a better grasp on a peaceful disposition. And perhaps as I get more of a peaceful disposition, I get a better handle on what's going on.

I believe "systems" and "dynamics" are closely related to "complex reactive systems", and thus any discussion of failure or errors is best informed by approaching the issue with the 18 questions/statements of [How Complex Systems Fail: Being a Short Treatise on the Nature of Failure; How Failure is Evaluated; How Failure is Attributed to Proximate Cause; and the Resulting New Understanding of Patient Safety](https://how.complexsystems.fail/)

Briefly, Kristi's family, and Kristi, have displayed depressive and avoidant tendencies, across generations. Kristi's tended towards depressive states, especially as a reaction to increased stress and difficulty. For a long time, I was motivated to move in opposite directions as a reaction to stress and difficulty. This divide (which relates to substantial trauma we both experienced as children and more recently) eventually led to Kristi becoming systemically verbally and emotionally abusive towards me.

For many reasons it took a very long time for me to recognize this, and eventually start protecting myself and adjusting expectations to better care for myself. It was deeply damaging and felt like repeated, horrific betrayals, for a long time.

There's plenty of environmental factors that contributed to this, but they're not really that important.

I observed in myself a slow-but-persistent decline on so many levels. I kept having exchanges with Kristi where I'd be met with hostility, negativity, anger, frustration. There would be "relationship ruptures" but no "relationship repairs". (Gottman writes extensively about the cycles. Example: [the four horseman of the marriage apocalypse](https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-four-horsemen-recognizing-criticism-contempt-defensiveness-and-stonewalling/)

> why do I feel this incredible decrease in quality of my relationship with myself and others, mostly marked by a massive increase in feelings of alienation from others and self, and feelings of deep and pervasive shame, of a kind I'd not experienced in many, many years?

I examined the changes I was seeing in my own personality. These were very unliked and unappreciated changes - I was conscious and resisting the change, even as I was watching the changes happen. The changes reminded me of ways I felt (but had dramatically less ability to vocalize) when I was a child and young adult.

Historically I've sought (and engaged in) relationships and friendships full of shared experiences, mutual support, some adventure, some appreciation of beauty, going new places and having new experiences, doing things worth doing, long-term and short-term goals, positive emotional energy, and more. I care _a lot_ about my friendships. I prefer to spend energy and time in relationships where that energy is seen and appreciated.

So, I got walloped by a flood of unremitting negative energy, broken only by silence or tense withdrawal, never punctuated with periods of closeness, kindness, compassion, or empathy, but was generally blamed for all of it, even as I kept acting as someone who had good reason to expect future periods of closeness, kindness, compassion and empathy in this relationship. I was told expecting/demanding these things was rushing it - I needed to be patient for weeks/months/years of incremental progress towards treating me with slightly less meanness than yesterday.

Plainly, _this is abuse_. I kept getting unexpected reactions when I brought my evidence and observations and experiences to very close friends, and I think a string of these fumbled conversations made things worse for everyone, not better.[^church-and-abuse]

[^church-and-abuse]: I will absolutely write about "The church" and "institutionalized abusive behavior" soon. It's bad. Shame is such a wide-spread tool for behavior control, isn't it?

Incidentally, I don't think people who's behavior patterns best roll up as "verbally/emotionally abusive" are 'bad people', I believe it's a _deeply_ ingrained response to trauma, the kind of trauma that hearing about would make your heart break ten different times. That said, the world conforms to structure and power dynamics, and certain patterns invite/dissuade certain classes of interactions.

I no longer want to participate in patterns of conflict and verbal abuse. I've not quite figured out how to step off the train, but am working on it.

## Books I've read, and that I believe shed light/signal on what's been going on in my marriage

My marriage has historically been a source/center for/inspiration of all the good things that tend to circulate people who enjoy each other's company and way of being. I've grown more sophisticated in the last two years, in how I perceive relationships (my own and other people's), so the version of me (and Kristi) at 24 years old is very different than me today, at 33, but I can effortlessly see threads of similarity and reasonable evolution in how we'd engaged in the world around us ten years and five years ago, and how we seem to be doing this now.

First, an explanation for the books you're about to see listed: I've always been book-oriented. Even as a ten year old, I read, _a lot_. It was with a small sense of pride that I learned, when I was perhaps 13, that on at least the standardized tests I took as a homeschooler, I read at or above a college level.[^skilled-at-sports]

[^skilled-at-sports]: This didn't lead to ego inflation, I believe, because I immediately thought much less of "college-level reading"; I wasn't impressed (at all) with my own reading - I simply liked to read, and disappear into the worlds I encountered in books. I suppose I was better at reading than some peers, but I saw it as an interests divergence, no more, no less.  The people I knew then and now, who were/are deeply impressive to me from an athletic perspective share a similar approach - they're not necessarily impressed with themselves, even as they know they're _way_ better than most more casual participants of said sport. they simply happen to "enjoy" the kinds of things that make them good at said sport. All that to say, I've "historically read a lot", many years approaching or exceeding 100 books read in that year. In hindsight that's probably too many, but whatever.

Here's some books that, as I've lived the last few years, have come to have particularly high explanatory power for the relationship between external events and internal experiences in my life.

I read at a high enough rate that it's relatively painless (especially related to the potential reward) to 'read the canon'[^read-cannon] in any given domain. I start with one book, and then branch out from there, either thematically or via citations/references. Of course I often digest related podcasts and topical digital content.

[^read-cannon]: I mean this in the sense of 'literary/scene-setting canon' and 'accepted high-culture canon', from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon). It's analogous to looking at an issue intentionally from several different frames. I'm competent at identifying some instances of internal (in)consistency within frames, _and_ between frames. It might be obvious, but me reading a book (and referencing it) certainly ought not to be treated as an endorsement of the book or the ideas espoused within. I've watched "Birth of a Nation" and read _Mein Kampf_. I am _down_ for reading/understanding propaganda and/or the views of _very_ bad people. It'll be up to you to infer from context if I'm recommending something, or holding it up as an example of a bad thing.

Here's some of the books I've read lately. There's a theme:

## Memetics

There's this book, [Worth The Candle](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36146179-worth-the-candle?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=wogfgw2d0G&rank=1), that is quite good. It smashes some interesting concepts together, in a bit of a fantasy universe, that lead to interesting "frame-shifting experiential outcomes".

Frame control might be a topic for a larger conversation some day, but here's a good overview: [Frame Control, by @aella](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bQ6zpf6buWgP939ov/frame-control).

June, in _Worth the Candle_, encounters 'memetic threats', which are ideas which if vocalized or considered in a certain way could have a deliterous effect, like a landmine going off.[^shia]

Ideas matter. Ideas come from (and go) different places. I think "less social media usage is better than more", but to that end, here's a smattering of links that felt relvant.

Part of the therapy we've been doing (together and individually) has made use of written notes, and I've always been an aggregator of 'useful ideas'. It's like a smattering of software development notes. They might help others, they certainly help me.

[^shia]: For example: [Shia LaBeouf](https://alexanderwales.fandom.com/wiki/Shia_LaBeouf)

So, memes and frames matter. I view our relationship from a few of those perspectives. To that end, sometimes I see something that says/expresses a concept in a meaningful/illuminating way. To the degree a concept or idea is difficult to convey, approaching it from many different directions can help shed light on "the thing" we're trying to talk about.

## Attachment theory

> An anxious and avoidant attachment walk into a bar...

Kristi and I have both had a variety of hellish experiences coupled with conspicuous neglect, from very young ages, through those tender adolescent and teenage years, and it wasn't all great as adults. We've accumulated trauma, and have some nature/nurture proclivities towards anxious attachment styles (me) and avoidant (her). Things may have turned to "disorganized", and there's lots of co-regulating in the wrong direction going on.

There's this account on instagram, `@thesecurerelationship`, who is wonderful. Here's a prototypical post:

## Tiktok links

I have some beef with Tiktok.

It's undeniable that it has an affect on the world. Don't know how I feel about it, but it's deff good for "feeling seen" sometimes. To that end, here's a smattering of videos I've felt some kinship with. I'll explain each, eventually. For now, just consider skimming:

I thought this one was... sad:

This next one is on manipulation. I was raised in an environment full of manipulation, toxic masculinity, and more.

I did a lot of manipulation "to survive", and learned it as a tool to solve the problems I was facing. I have few memories of my own childhood, but I clearly remember being unwillfully manipulated into things _all the time_. By people who then said they loved me. anyway:

## Quotes around power and abuse

The more someone has spent time dealing with issues of individual/organizational misbehavior (like issues leading to, and stemming from, abuse and neglect), the more they seem to have intuitive mental models that fit the frames of the above books I've listed.

There's two general polarities at play. Focusing on what is _most wrong_ and focusing on what could be _most right_. It's important to focus on what's gone wrong, but I think in any situation of mistreatment (and systemic mistreatment that reads as abuse or neglect) the correct response invites and makes space for evaluating what could be best-case-scenario outcomes, not _just_ reflecting on the past.

Anyway, here's some of what _to_ do. Quotes from various books:

> There are two kinds of power. One kills the spirit. The other nourishes the spirit. The first is Power Over. The other is Personal Power.
>
> _Power Over shows up as control and dominance. Personal Power shows up as mutuality and co-creation._
>
> Mutuality is a way of being with another person which promotes the growth and well-being of one's self _and_ the other person by means of clear communication and empathetic understanding.
>
> Co-creation is a consciously shared participation in life which helps one reach one's goals.

## So what? Now what?

I've worked on this post off and on for a while. I've recognized an absolutely real difficulty in knowing how to ask for help. [In some cases, I'm at least decent at asking for help](https://josh.works/better-questions), but on the whole, in ways that have mattered more than usual, I would not yet self-identify as one who's skilled at making needs/requests visible in "normal/cool ways". (These requests for help have gone poorly a high percentage of the times I've made them in the last few years)

So, knowing that this page summarizes my best understanding of the world. you can imagine how frustrated and beat down I feel. Generally, things that line up well with "caring for depressed people" works for me. I enjoy time with others, so email me, text me, call me, visit with me. Feel free to plainly discuss anything you've read on this website, or discuss it with others.

The hardest thing for me, around spending time with other people, has been feeling like this (the above context-setting) is something I couldn't talk about without placing others in an uncomfortable place. I generally _yearn_ for "weighty conversations of meaningful things, and am happy to bear witness/hold space for whatever comes up, as needed", so it was hard for me to endure not talking about how the most important thing in my life was withering and dying, even as my partner would pretend (to me and others) that "everything is fine".

So, things are not fine. I've gotten dramatically more comfortable with the idea of divorce than I once was, and as things continue to go unresolved, I continue to move in that direction. It's quite sad.

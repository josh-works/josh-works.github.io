I love breakfast.
Almost every morning for the last three years 
**I have had a frying pan full of bacon, and three eggs**
.



There are plenty of reasons I do this. Every one knows protein is good for you. But that fat... that grease. That cholesterol. I'm going to die young, right?



**I don't think so.**



Before you dismiss me out of hand, just look through two articles.


* [The Definitive Guide to Bacon](http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2013/02/19/the-definitive-guide-to-bacon/)


* [Art of Manliness "Boost Your Testosterone - Naturally"](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2013/01/18/how-to-increase-testosterone-naturally/)


I won't go into it all here, but know this: 
**There is a group of intelligent, scientifically literate people who believe it is goodfor you to eat bacon and eggs every day.**



If you love bacon, but it's too much work every day to cook - tune in on Thursday. I'm going through my method to remove all friction from the cooking process, and make it the best part of your morning.

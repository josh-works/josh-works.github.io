_note: as of late 2017, I've rolled over to a mostly vegetarian diet. I still love meat, but don't feel comfortable eating it, for ethical reasons. I still believe that, on a whole, bacon is good for you, and I still eat veggies and many eggs every day. I just don't eat bacon or other kinds of meat, except very occasionally. I'm leaving the rest of this post unedited for posterity's sake._

I love breakfast.

Almost every morning for the last three years **I have had a frying pan full of bacon, and three eggs**.

There are plenty of reasons I do this. Every one knows protein is good for you. But that fat... that grease. That cholesterol. I'm going to die young, right?

**I don't think so.**

Before you dismiss me out of hand, just look through two articles.

* [The Definitive Guide to Bacon](http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2013/02/19/the-definitive-guide-to-bacon/)

* [Art of Manliness "Boost Your Testosterone - Naturally"](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2013/01/18/how-to-increase-testosterone-naturally/)

I won't go into it all here, but know this: **There is a group of intelligent, scientifically literate people who believe it is goodfor you to eat bacon and eggs every day.**

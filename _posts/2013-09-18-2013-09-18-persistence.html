<p>Persistence. It's worth far more than any finite sum of money. Actually, it's worth more than an unlimited amount of money, because an unlimited amount of money would complicate my life (and probably yours) far more than we can possibly imagine.
Persistence. I keep trying to think some people are born with it, and others (me) didn't. Or I prefer to think that it can be had only if it were shaped properly by my parents from a young age. If that didn't work, it's sure not through lack of trying. (Thanks for not disowning me at 17, mom and dad!).</p>
<p>I can easily start fifteen different projects. Statistically, thirteen of them are crap. Two of them may have weight. I'll make motions to work on both for a little while, and then I give up. I just drop it. I've done it a lot of times. It's not going to stop until I make it stop.</p>
<p>I've spent at least a few hours learning over a dozen different things in the last few months, but have not stuck with many of them. This may be good or it may be bad. I certainly can't tell which of my fifteen ideas are crap, and it would behoove me to drop the bad ones, or I could be demonstrating a lack of persistence and stick-to-it-iveness.</p>
<p>It's refreshing to not be required to all this sorted out. I thought once I graduated college I'd not be wrestling with this stuff.</p>
<p>Hah.</p>

<p>These last few posts have a theme. We moved. I'm writing about it a lot because I thought about it a lot, and a lot of work went into it.
When moving across the country, you have a few options. You could higher a moving company, who comes and boxes up your house, packs a truck, drives the truck, and unpacks it when you arrive. This is expensive.</p>
<p>You can also get a movable storage container, like a POD. This is expensive.</p>
<p>You can rent a truck that fits all your things, and tow your car behind it. This is expensive. It would have been about $2300 for us to go this route.</p>
<p>So, we towed a U-haul behind our Corolla.</p>
<p>The total price, including getting a hitch installed, was about $500. It was 4x8x4. 128 cubic feet.</p>
<p>Because of the weight, we didn't go much faster than 60 mph the entire drive out. Nineteen hours of driving the first day, sixteen the second.</p>

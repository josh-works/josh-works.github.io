Kristi and I moved to Golden, Colorado. We've been in our new apartment for five days. I'm trying to quickly settle into a routine that makes sense for both of us.</p>
<p>For example - I work for a company in Boston. While I could keep local working hours (Mountain Time) I prefer to free up my afternoons and evenings by keeping Eastern time. So my work day starts at 6:30am. I don't want to be rushed in the morning, so I'd like to be getting up by about 5:30.</p>
<p>So far, I've been getting up when I want, but I'm getting very tired by the early evening. I'm not going to bed early enough.</p>
<p>My priority right now is to figure out 1) How to go to bed early and 2) how to incorporate naps into my day.</p>
<p>Both of these take thought, and are not something I'll just throw myself into.</p>

# I found a limit

These last two weeks have been the hardest, or the most frustrating, of my time at Turing so far.

I've been put a little off-balance by this difficulty, and I think I'm close to uncovering some useful tidbit or idea that will serve me well, and might serve someone else too.

Several different people warned me that

> Mod 3 is just like mod 1 in terms of difficulty

I wasn't sure what to make of that, because Mod 1 wasn't too bad of a struggle. I think I gave myself a bad case of the "mismatched expectations".

## Expectations

### My technical understanding is deficient

This week we've unpacked a few sizable new topics:

- Oauth/Omniauth for user authentication (against Twitter and Github)
- Using Figaro to protect sensative environment variables
- Using Faraday to handle all the HTTP traffic
- OmniAuth's stubs/testing tools
- VCR to record API responses, so every time we run our tests we're not pounding a remote API
- Stubbing out all the necessary user information so we can write really detailed tests.



### My group work was deficient

I've tried to generally be the "strong" contributor to group projects, and so far in Turing, I have been.

Then this last one around, I felt like I was dragging, holding my partner back. I learned a lot, but I'd hoped that there was less to learn along the way.

It would have been nice.


## Trust the process

I've still got what seems to be a passable system for gaining new (and complex) information.

I started feeling underwater when I stopped following it.

## Lessons to retain for later

Embrace uncertainty.

Expect to learn a lot.

Write it all down.

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_153905">There are many types of people in the world, all with different approaches to "getting stuff done". My approach to doing stuff is different from my wife's approach. (Who'da thunk?)
These two years of marriage have revealed much. One of these "revelations" was this: my sense of worth is closely tied to how well I think I'm accomplishing tasks and goals, across a broad spectrum. In some ways, this is good. I set goals, plan how to accomplish them, and even manage to compete a few percentage points of these goals.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_153908">The downsides <em>were</em> subtle, and two-fold:</p>
<ol id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_153914">
<li>
<strong>Since my sense of worth is tied to accomplishments, I evaluate others in the same way.</strong> Imagine being married to someone who only acts like they love you if you're industrious and productive. Yikes!</li>
<li>
<strong>Since my sense of worth is tied to accomplishments, I feel guilt and shame when I fail to meet whatever standards I have.</strong> This cycle feeds itself, so I'll either work harder, sort of like penance, or I'll fall deeper into guilt and shame.</li>
</ol>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_153924">I said these downsides <em>were </em>subtle, because until about a year ago, I was blind to this thinking. This led to strife in my marriage, as Kristi would feel like I didn't delight in her unless she was working on some side project. I couldn't figure out why I wasn't delighting in her. (Pro tip: While true, saying "I'm choosing to love you." is not always romantic. The counterargument: "So you have to <em>choose</em>?")</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_153933">Here's where I would normally want to put next action steps for fixing these problems. The first step to dealing with this was realizing I couldn't self-help my way out of it. <a href="http://marshill.com/the-gospel">The Gospel</a> speaks to these issues in a far deeper way than anything else can.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436128897120_153939">In sum: I am deeply broken. So is Kristi. And we can rejoice in this truth.</p>

<p>My wife played a brilliant prank on me today, as she does every year. Here's a partial list:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Convincing me that I was about to eat a slice of carrot cake; it was a sponge covered with toothpaste. I bit into it.</li>
<li>Convincing me that she had, in anger and frustration, cut off almost all of her hair, and had pictures to prove it; unflattering camera angles + bobby pins = confused Josh</li>
<li>Feeding me soapy water</li>
<li>Convincing me she had a <em>very</em> forward suitor who wouldn't take no for an answer; she and I were engaged, and it fell to me to do something about it.</li>
</ul>
<p>She has gotten me many other times. I love April fools day, but I'm not sure why. I don't generally enjoy being tricked, but I love seeing the many things Kristi thinks up, and how she tricks me.</p>
<p>It requires trust. I won't be so easily tricked by most people, but my guard is down (obviously) when I'm with my wife. And this is healthy. I think part of the reason I love April Fools Day is because she couldn't trick me if I didn't trust her. That vulnerability is freeing.</p>
<p>It takes work, though, building a relationship in which you can be vulnerable. I (and I think the rest of humanity) instinctually recoils from vulnerability. And this cheapens our relationships, robs us of opportunities for joy.</p>

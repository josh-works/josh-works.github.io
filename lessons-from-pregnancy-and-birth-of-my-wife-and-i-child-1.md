### We were low-hope over the last year

So we didn't plan/prepare mentally for much after birth. 

We prepped well for birth, esp. Kristi, but we got laid out pretty hard by the post-birth experience.

Having a mother-in-law that you get along with well is a huge benefit.

Multigenerational housing FTW

We have tons of time of/together. Kristi, 3 months. Mom, 6 weeks, me... meh

# How to download sermons

run `./download-sermon-mp3.sh` (i had to `chmod 777 download-sermon-mp3` first) to download the mp3 of the given sermon.

Script taken from firefox devtools > network, finding the network call for the sermon, formatting it a little, and stashing it here.

Ethan's sermons seem to often have playback issues, and I'm afraid of losing them forever, so... here's how I'm downloading them, slowly.

Lots to be done in terms of renaming them and whatnot, but this is good enough for now.

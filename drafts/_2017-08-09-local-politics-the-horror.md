**[TL;DR]() I'm running for political office, and I believe I'll be a terrible "politician", for many reasons, and this post will in part absolve me of guilt about that fact even as I pursue the opportunity.**

This hurts to write, and I'm dancing around feeling incredible embarrassment.

The above feelings are further complicated because I don't know if I *should* feel incredible embarrassment, or if I should be feeling... something else.

Here's the gist: **I'm running for Golden's City Council.**

I feel like throwing up a little. Maybe that's just because the flight I'm on is hitting some turbulance, but I think it's partially guided by some healthy revulsion.

Why do I feel conflicted about this? Why is it disgusting?

There are certainly *some* people who think getting involved in local politics is a good thing, and there's another group of people who thing they're being _public servants_ by "shouldering the burden of providing wise rule".

# Reasons for disgust

## I don't think that government is the right solution to _anything_

Not only am I *not* sold that we ("the citizens") _need_ a government, I've been reluctantly forced to the conclusion that we ("the citizens") would be better off without _any_ government.

Yes. You read that correctly. You're reading the words of a real, bonafide, tin-foil-hat-wearing _anarchist_.

Before you get yourself in a dither, (or is it too late?) scan the Amazon reviews of the following books (or read the books themselves!):

- [The Problem of Political Authority]()
- [American Healthcare Killed My Father]()

I'm not here to convince you that I'm right, I'd just like you to be open to the notion that I'm not insane and dangerous to society.

In light of that preamble, this means that (to me) the notion of a "public servant" is a logical contradiction. The government relies upon a special kind of authority to function. The "authority" is mostly circular reasoning, moving between:

> respect our rules because we're the government

and

> we're the government because we make the rules

## The Overton Window dictates no original thought will come from a politician, including myself, no matter how well intentioned

[The Overton Window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window) is a notion that any possible political outcome is always one that is tolerable to all parties. Usually, the thing that is tolerable to both parties is also dispised by both, because "compromise" is never actually an effective solution, but it's the one that gets forced through via the vote, so that's what we get.

Activists' role in politics is to move the Ovarton window, so that (hopefully) a good solution becomes palatable to all sides, and gets chosen.

Politicians are rational, self-interested creatures. They're not better than anyone, they might be worse than most. Nothing that good will come from them. The best we can hope for is for the population to move enough in the right direction that it becomes socially acceptible for the average politician to support healthy ideas. 

## Bureaucrats are extremely risk averse

I don't know the difference between a politician and a bureaucrat, but I lump them in the same category.

All my feelings on bureaucrats can be summed up by [Bureaucrats]() by [Author?](), but it lays out a strong case for why it's a utopian ideal to expect much beyond _risk management within a very narrow domain_ from the average "public servant".

## Politicians are professional rule makers

Given the [growth of the Federal Register](http://dailycaller.com/2013/05/21/the-towering-federal-register/), politicians are _exceptional_ at making new rules for people to follow. (The government cranks out 286 pages of regulation _per workday_)

![the federal register is HUGE](https://regulatorystudies.columbian.gwu.edu/sites/regulatorystudies.columbian.gwu.edu/files/downloads/CFR_pages.JPG)

We're at 180,000 pages in the federal register. I'd challenge you to be able to defend more than 1/5th of those pages. (Don't get too mad! That leaves you 36,000 pages into which you can fit your favorite federal rules)

I'm pretty bad at following rules, and (childishly) often go out of my way to break rules that I perceive to be arbitrary or dumb, just in the spirit of not following dumb rules.

Most of this "rule of law" thing we talk about in America is mostly the "rule of rules", and the rules themselves cannot be arrived at from [first principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle). If a "law" is really just a "rule", and the rule cannot be arrived at from first principles, in my mind, it's invalid and has no weight, and we'd all be better off as a society if we ignored it. (Looking at you, prohibition).

If I'm successful running for city council (and I might well be... stranger things have happened, right?) one of the only ways I could tolerate my own presence on the council would be to consistently oppose the creation of new rules, and be the annoying guy arguing for the endless simplification of rules, and removal of rules. 

This approach would earn me a functional failing grade as a politician, since they're mostly judged on making new rules, but I'd be able to maintain my dignity (maybe) and my self-respect, so that's what I'll do. 

Phew.

## City council often decides matters related to zoning

OK, now we're getting to the heart of the matter.

Federal politics is a cesspool of filth, and it's mostly the political class getting their back scratched by whoever can buy them off, to collude with each other (and their handlers/donors) to screw over the average person.

Local politics isn't quite as overtly hostile to the average person, and I've been treated well by the political/local government folks I've interacted with.

(Keep in mind I'm young, white, married, educated. I'm part of the "desirable" class of people everyone could imagine moving into their neighborhood and having 2.4 kids. Oh, and I used to do sales, so I can usually talk my way into other people liking me. _This is all cause for concern_ and doesn't mean politics is "fair and open")

Zoning policy is the ideological brain-child of [redlining](http://www.epi.org/publication/making-ferguson/), [institutional racism](http://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america), [xenophobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusionary_zoning), and [class/race-based prejudice](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/05/the-racist-housing-policy-that-made-your-neighborhood/371439/).

Most of the stuff we all hate about neighborhoods and poorly-built/designed public space isn't the result of the "free market", but is the result of [even more government manipulation in the market](https://medium.com/@devonmarisa/financing-suburbia-6076dae990f8). This chain of cause and effect goes all the way up to the Federal Reserve going to great lengths to make people buy houses they cannot afford. I love healthy, financially solvant communities, and "moar zoning" isn't the way to get there.

That is a *very* bold statement, but a quick romp through the records of when people talked openly about *why* zoning policy was being developed shows its true colors. (Incidentally, the reason government got into marriage licensing has a [similar background](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/26/opinion/26coontz.html), and look at how the original (racist) purpose of marriage policy was twisted into moralizing and hand-wringing.)

So, I perceive zoning, as a system of rules, to be immoral and a mechanism for oppression by the relatively powerful of the relatively less powerful.

If this is the context I bring to any discussion about zoning, I cannot in good faith support a simple modification to the code, unless it is in the direction of reducing the heavy burden of zoning on a given plot of land.

The question of

> should we give a private homeowner a variance on the minimum parking requirement to build an [ADU]() on his/her property

sounds to me like

> Should we ban Irish immigrants from living in this neighborhood, or should we just ban them from living in our city all together?

In other words, the answer to the question at hand is:

> The government has no right to tell people how they can and cannot use their property, because in doing so, they're favoring one group to the detriment against another.

It goes against how I want to interact with the world around me, to support in any way an immoral institution. So I'm not going to support it.

Oh, by the way, [zoning is not about keeping a factory from going up next door]().


# Reasons I'm pursuing this anyway

I've just made a good case for not getting involved in local politics. Why the heck am I doing it anyway?

## 1. Low barrier to entry

Turns out anyone who's lived within Golden city limits for at least a year can run for city council.

With such a low barrier to entry, to feels like it would almost be irreverant to NOT try to get elected. In my mind, it's related to the concept of [red teaming]() for network security.

## 2. Curiosity

I am endlessly curious, obviously about technical things and ideas, but also in domains related to relationships and people. Sometimes I've tried to talk my way into restricted areas _just to see if I could_. (Surprise! You can!)

An affinity for social engineering, a generally pessimistic view of politics, and the opportunity to see this whole process from up close... it's an opportunity that is hard to pass up.

## 3. Share the experience to the potential edification of others

The millennial crowd seems to be interested in "getting involved", but since [federal election participation is a complete farce](), we're rightfully dissuaded from participation. And given that congress is liked less than [Comcast](), [strip mining](), and [United right after they dragged the guy off the plane](), "participation in the process" holds zero appeal to me.

So, I plan on documenting what I learn (right here, right now. You're reading it!) so that if there's something to learn and other people who are similarly disenfranchised and frustrated with how things seem to play out want to pull similarly poor stunts, they can do so.


## 4. Try to dismantle bad things from the inside

It should be no surprise that I'd love to see diminished governmental influence in the world, and I might be able to shine some light on how the sausage is made.

This "light" might reduce that reflexive affirmation of the necessary and benevolent role government plays in our lives, and if someone gets a little less impressed with "public officials" after following the process... it's been a good day.

## 5. Make some money

The salary of a city councilor is $1200/month. That's not too shabby, though compared to the long-term income potential of a reasonably skilled software developer, it's not a huge amount.

I'm not going to pretend like I'm going to donate my salary out of a sense of altruism. I'm going to keep it, and use it to continue fleshing out our savings.

It's too little money to support someone full-time, and I think it's too much money to pay professional rule-makers, but my argument for why this "election process" isn't actually fair and open will have to wait for another time.



# Things I'm not

## 1. Qualified

(list the other candidates, their pages)

## 2. That interested in long chats with concerned citizens who want me to exert some power in their favor

## 3. A big believer in the efficacy of a democratic republic

## 4. 

To get on the ballot, I had to collect twenty-five signatures from people who live in the ward I'm competing for. Since I live in a condo association with three buildings filled with a few hundred people each, I just went door to door, asking people to sign.

I collected 50 signatures, so that if any of the signatures were not valid, I would still have plenty of room and would be eligible.

I'm going to be out of town for the rest of the time period where I could qualify, so if I didn't get it right the first time, I'd not be able to run for city council.

This meant I had to talk to a lot of people about this little project of mine.

I got many variations of the same few questions:

- "What political party are you?"
- "What's your political platform"
- "Why are you trustworthy"

My answer was pretty simple:

> I'm neither democratic or republican, and while I lean libertarian, I'm pretty displeased with that party too. I don't have a "platform", because I don't think it's the government's job to try to do even MORE to/for it's subjects/citizens.
>
> I'm not trustworthy, and don't claim to be a good or selfless person, but I personally wouldn't trust someone who claimed to be those things.
>
> The strongest thing I've got going for me, and why you should support me, is I don't actually want to do this, but it would be even worse if someone who enjoyed this process and thought their benevolent dictatorship could be a force for good got the spot.

# Summary

I think I've laid out a pretty strong reason why I shouldn't be trusted in political office. I think democracy/a democratic republic is the last-bad system of rule we've found so far, but I have zero reflexive trust in "the process".

Believe it or not, I believe there is *enormous* value you people in a community "coming together" to decide how something should be handled, but if one of those people happens to exercise the [only legitimate use of physical violence against someone else](), it's not a fair meeting.

To that end, I have already started talking with people who care deeply about how Golden develops as a community. I love their input, I love running ideas by them, and how their set of concerns and interests balances my obviously-insane ideas about how the world should work.

I've attempted to paint my political leaning in the most critical way possible, and I'm going to keep this post easy to find.

As I *shudder* _campaign_ later, I plan on driving as many people as I can to this post. If I actually get appointed to the city council, I don't want anyone to claim I tricked them or misled them on what I plan on doing.

#### goals:

- Abolish maximum housing units. If I can fit three units in the footprint of a typical single family home there’s no reason I shouldn’t be allowed to.
- Eliminate minimum lot sizes.
- Remove side yard setbacks. These create a powerful financial incentive to assemble large parcels for the development of monolithic structures.
- Eliminate maximum lot coverages for small lots.

I live in Golden. More technically, Ward 2, District 1.

On this page, you'll find:

- [Issues and my stance on them]()

I think I'm supposed to convince you to vote for me, but I'm not going to do that.

I am going to convince you why you *shouldn't* vote for me. If, after reading through all of the following, you've not run away screaming, maybe you and I could get along well.


# Reasons you should not vote for me

## 1. I'm not "qualified" for public office

(list the other candidates, their pages)

The other folks running in the ward are accomplished. They are vice presidents, CEOs, business men and women. They are skilled at the  challenging task of running large organizations.

I find the base premise of the political authority of the state to be flawed, and it is the functional equivalent of pouring sand into an engine. Therefore, instead of trying to figure out how to run the government "in the best interests of the citizens", or "in a democratic fashion", my aims would be to reduce the influence the local government has on the rights of the residents.

## 2. I'm not interested in long chats with concerned citizens who want me to exert political power in their favor

I'm afraid that being a city councilor will ruin my relationships with most people, because now any conversation someone has with me will go through the lens of trying to impact how I might vote on something.

This is unfortunate, because:

1. I'm not going to be changing my opinions on things based on other people's input, unless they're able to fundamentally shift [how I view the world]().
2. I certainly won't participate in [regulatory capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture), and am aware of [the dictatorship of the small minority](https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15)

If "the small minority" is pushing for something that either uses government coercion to achieve some end state beneficial to them, or is trying to do something that could be sorted out without the use of government at all, I will vehemently oppose the use of state power in that situation.

So, professional busy-bodies will not be pleased with anything I have to offer. This shouldn't be a surprise, though, and I don't really want their support anyway.

## 3. I'm not a big believer in the efficacy of a democratic republic

Many people in America believe a democratic republic is the highest expression of group organization available to man.

I disagree. I think it's great at some things (like helping people feel good about their government) and terrible at other things. (Like protecting the rights of low-power/status groups and individuals.)

I think and hope that my grandkids will breathlessly ask me questions like

> Grandpa, did you *really* let complete strangers living thousands of miles away dictate almost every aspect of your life to their own benefit?

And I'll say

> Yes, and it was just as ridiculous as it sounds. Fortunately, we all wised up to the mistake, and stopped supporting their coercive power.

By it's very definition, a democracy can cause harm to minorities. A "minority group" could be determined by race, spoken language, income level, political affiliation, sexual orientation, or dozens of any other factors. A minority group could be as large as 49% of the population, or as small as a single individual.

Our democratic republic has historically done great harm to the current unpopular group.

The political process will always be managed for the benefits of some groups at the expense of others. Since I find this immoral, I would reject and fight against any proposal that favors one group at the expense of the other.




# Issues and my stance on them

I love questions about tactical matters. It's easy to be pie-in-the-sky and talk about hope and change and all that, and people can have massive disagreement over many things, though it might turn out that when it comes to the actual decisions to be made, or the outcomes they're looking for, everyone is much more likely to be in agreement than they thought.

So, here's the issues:

- Growth
- Schools
- Zoning

## 1. "Golden is growing too quickly! We need to stop it!"

Golden's growing quickly. My wife and I are as much of the problem as anyone else. We moved here three years ago, and are part of the masses that are driving up rent and housing prices.

"Stopping growth" is a bad idea, but more importantly, it's a horrible use of the authority of a government.

The way a government stops growth is by saying "no more people can live here", but since you can't legally throw new residents out of their homes, the roundabout method of getting there is by putting a limit on new housing units to be constructed, or by making it too expensive for most people to build more housing units.

Both of these are an unjust use of political authority. Here's why:

If I own property, and I want to finish my basement so my in-laws can move in, or so I can rent it to college students, I cannot do that without seeking permission from the state. (by "the state" I mean someone representing the government, not the state of Colorado).

The state can reject my request if they so choose, and if I add to my property without permission, I face fines and sanctions.

I reject out of hand the notion that someone should be able to dictate what I can and cannot do to my property. If what I do doesn't directly violate the rights of someone else, there is no sound moral bases for using the power of the state to prohibit me from taking those actions.

# Why do questions matter?

### Traits of a good question

### Traits of a bad question

We're eventually going to be paid to solve hard problems. Life is full of hard problems, though, so this isn't daunting.

When we get stuck, however, we'll need to get help. And since we're solving a hard problem, it's reasonable to assume that the person helping us will also agree that it is a tricky problem.

This means that you probably will _not_ be so lucky as to get a silver-bullet solution.

(I'd describe a silver bullet solution as some fancy enumerator you can call on a list to return just the thing you want, or some ActiveRecord method called `current_user.invoices.where_invoice_id_is_also_to_be_found_on_this_other_random_table.do_analytics_math_and_turn_results_into_embeddable_html_with_fancy_animations.match_current_color_scheme`)

If we could just chain cool methods together, our lives would be easy. We'd spend all day in our terminal, doing things like:

```
rails new money_printing_app --do-customer-research --aggregate-results --seed-popular-words-in-schema --connect-top-3-social-media-accounts --mobile-friendly --deposit-income-to-checking-account-weekly --viral=true
```

This isn't possible, so we have to ask for help.

That's the good news. I don't think any of us need to be convinced that we need help.

Here's the bad news. It's hard to give good, effective help to hard problems.

### Barriers to good help

Lets look at a few examples of requests for help that have room to improve:

> Anyone able to help me with some database questions?

> I'm having some problems getting a method to work. Can we screenhero for a few minutes?

> Can you help me troubleshoot some weird errors I'm getting in my terminal?

Now, we can't pick on these too hard, because in some way or another, we've all asked these questions.

Paraphrasing a recent conversation:

> A mediocre developer who asks good questions and can communicate well
> can  become a bigger contributor to a team than an experienced
> dev who doesn't communicate well

Time is expensive. Attention is even more expensive.

Our duty, as junior developers, is to minimize our burden on the team we are on, and to become a net add to the team as soon as possible.

Bonus points for signaling competentce and attentiveness along the way.

Asking good questions will separate you from the crowd.


## Checklist


- What you are trying to do.
- What steps have you taken so far?
- What errors have you seen?
- What sources have you consulted in your search for these answers?
- What is the TL;DR?
- Have you included relevant code snippets or stack traces?

This puts the burden of asking questions on _you_, instead of the person you're asking for help.

If you don't provide this information, the first thing the other person will ask is

> What are you trying to do?
> What steps have you taken so far?
> What errors have you seen?
> What have you done to try to fix this?
> Can I look at some code?

We can't always write out a super detailed, perfect-in-every-way, StackOverflow-ready question when we have problems, but we should aim for it.

Good questions:
- Stack overflow
- My gists
- Stuff from Regis?

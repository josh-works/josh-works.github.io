# Collection of thoughts on Turing

It's the last week of [Turing](). I went through the [backend software engineering program](), and it's been quite a journey.

In no particular order, I'm throwing down thoughts in three general categories:
- What went well
- What didn't go well
- What I might have done differently, were I to do it again

I believe there is a narrow window for me to capture this information well. As soon as I get a job, I'll probably forget everything that didn't go well, and if I were to _never_ get a job, I'd forget anything that went well.



## Went well

### Learning

I've learned a ton, and my pace of learning has steadily climbed through Turing, as I build a more and more robust mental for existing information. It's easier to add new information when the framework for the old stuff is strong.

I use Anki (a flashcard app) every day, so even on days when I don't write any code, I'm still getting reps in of practice, and strengthening mental pathways. I've used Anki every day since Turing started, and have almost 1000 cards in my programming deck.

### Cohort






## Didn't go well

I'm technically not graduated yet - I've started this a few days before the end of Turing.

I feel like the quality of my work on the last two big projects was low. I still have a lot to learn about JavaScript and DOM manipulation, and I've not yet gotten enough repetition in with those basics to have simple tasks be effortless and quick to achieve.

So, that's been a bit stressful. I have generally high standards for my work, and when I can't meet it, I become convinced that I'm failing everyone else's standards as well.

Why did these last two projects go poorly?

### Tactical reasons they went poorly

I expand on this concept below, but I have a "slow but thorough" learning style. I struggled to spend the time I needed getting in repetition and depth of learning while managing the high rate of work required at Turing.

If I didn't have the time to dig deep into something, I'd skip it, and aim to complete the projects.



### Strategic reasons they went poorly

I learn things slowly.

Some folks at Turing have expressed the incorrection assumption that I learn things quickly, and I try to correct their wrong thinking. I always aim to get early exposure to a topic, and to play with it quite a bit before I have to use it in any sort of production environment.

I did a fair amount of work before Turing to gain exposure to the topics we covered in the first half of the program, and consequently had a good frame of reference for the things we learned.

The topics in the 2nd half of the program I'd gained no prior exposure to, and felt ill-prepared by the recommended pre-work that we did over the intermission weeks.

For the duration of both of the second mods, I felt behind, simply enough.

The good news here, though, is given the world of difference that I experienced based soley on prior exposure to a topic... with repeated exposure, I can feel comfortable with just about anything.

This is encouraging, because I have many years to gain comfort with a range of technologies.

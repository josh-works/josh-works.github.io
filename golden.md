Hi there. My name is Josh Thompson.

I live in Golden. More technically, Ward 2, District 1.

My wife and I live in these apartments, and love 'em. (I like to rock climb. There's a climbing gym a 2 minute walk away. It's perfect!)

The following is going to be published in the Golden Informer soon. It's my "why you should/shouldn't vote for me" pitch.

-----------------
# You probably shouldn’t vote for me.

Here’s some reasons you might want to vote for me, followed by some reasons you shouldn’t:

## Qualification 1

**My wife and I adore Golden.**

Whenever friends and family visit from out of town, my wife and I play “tour guide” and excitedly take them around town, and try to convince them (often, successfully) that Golden is the coolest place ever.

## Qualification 2

**I’m sensitive to the range of perspectives on Golden’s affordability, because I want to someday see both my in-laws and children be able to live in Golden.**

A plan that eliminates the option for people to move to Golden wouldn’t work - it would drive housing prices even higher.

A plan that lets Golden be “suburbanized” and become like Lakewood wouldn’t work either - it would kill what makes Golden special.

A community that fits only one demographic, or one income level, is one of hopeless uniformity. If you like Golden, and would like family and friends to be able to afford to live nearby, we’ve got the same goals.

## Anti-qualification 1

**I know very little, and am even worse at telling the future.**

The way legislation tends to work is by codifying the current opinions of the majority (or a vocal minority), and making everyone live by those new laws.

These laws, born out of a desire to avoid some harm, lead to a rigid, inflexible, unbending solution that forces the community to conform to the law, instead of the law conforming the the community.

In contrast to this “opinions as law” approach, I love flexibility and experimentation, and dislike sterile, managed environments. Therefore, I will vote in support of experimentation, instead of in a way that assumes we have perfect knowledge and know the future.

## Anti-qualification 2

**I’m pessimistic on the ability of a bureaucratic organization to bring about new value to the world.**

If “believing that governments can solve all of the problems and can make everyone happy” is a prerequisite to run for city council, you would not be reading these words right now.

Some people think governments can solve all our problems. These people may be better suited to functioning within a bureaucratic organization than myself.

## Anti-qualification 3

**I don’t actually enjoy politics.**

I love being involved in the local community, but unfortunately, so much of what our local community looks like is completely dictated by local politics. So, if I want to be an active member of the community, it stands to reason I should be involved in the politics.

You might now be thinking:
> OK, Josh. I’ve read this far, but tell me how you’d vote on (topic X).

Good question. My opinions on issues related to local government are informed by people/books/organizations like:

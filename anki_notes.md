The first factor is a signal beamed out from your internal twenty-four-hour clock located deep within your brain. The clock creates a cycling, day-night rhythm that makes you feel tired or alert at regular times of night and day, respectively. The second factor is a chemical substance that builds up in your brain and creates a “sleep pressure.”

-----------------------

Yet daylight isn’t the only signal that the brain can latch on to for the purpose of biological clock resetting, though it is the principal and preferential signal, when present. So long as they are reliably repeating, the brain can also use other external cues, such as food, exercise, temperature fluctuations, and even regularly timed social interaction.

-----------------------

Since our innate biological rhythm is not precisely twenty-four hours, but thereabouts, a new nomenclature was required: the circadian rhythm—that is, one that is approximately, or around, one day in length, and not precisely one day.III In the seventy-plus years

The first concerns two hormones controlling appetite: leptin and ghrelin.II Leptin signals a sense of feeling full. When circulating levels of leptin are high, your appetite is blunted and you don’t feel like eating. Ghrelin, in contrast, triggers a strong sensation of hunger. When ghrelin levels increase, so, too, does your desire to eat. An imbalance of either one of these hormones can trigger increased eating and thus body weight. Perturb both in the wrong direction, and weight gain is more than probable.

To illustrate the concept of epiphenomena, let’s consider the lightbulb. The reason we construct the physical elements of a lightbulb—the glass sphere, the coiled wire element that sits inside, the screw-in electrical contact at the base—is to create light. That is the function of the lightbulb, and the reason we designed the apparatus to begin with. However, a lightbulb also produces heat. Heat is not the function of the lightbulb, nor is it the reason we originally fashioned it. Instead, heat is simply what happens when light is generated in this way. It is an unintended by-product of the operation, not the true function. Heat is an epiphenomenon in this case. Similarly, evolution may have gone to great lengths to construct the neural circuits in the brain that produce REM sleep and the functions that REM sleep supports. However, when the (human) brain produces REM sleep in this specific way, it may also produce this thing we call dreaming. Dreams, like heat from a lightbulb, may serve no function. Dreams may simply be epiphenomena of no use or consequence. They are merely an unintended by-product of REM sleep. Rather a depressing thought, isn’t it? I’m sure many of us feel that our dreams have meaning and some useful purpose. To address this stalemate, exploring whether dreaming, beyond the stage of sleep it emerges from, has true purpose, scientists began by defining the functions of REM sleep. Once those functions were known, we could then examine whether the dreams that accompany REM sleep—and the very specific content of those dreams—were crucial determinants of those adaptive benefits. If what you dream about offers no predictive power in determining the benefits of that REM sleep, it would suggest that dreams are epiphenomenal, and REM sleep alone is sufficient. If, however, you need both REM sleep and to be dreaming about specific things to accomplish such functions, it would suggest that REM sleep alone, although necessary, is not sufficient. Rather, a unique combination of REM sleep plus dreaming, and dreaming of very particular experiences, is needed to transact these nighttime benefits. If this was proven, dreams could not be dismissed as an epiphenomenal by-product of REM sleep. Rather, science would have to recognize dreaming as an essential part of sleep and the adaptive advantages it supports, above and beyond REM sleep itself. Using this framework, we have found

Your twenty-four-hour circadian rhythm is the first of the two factors determining wake and sleep. The second is sleep pressure. At this very moment, a chemical called adenosine is building up in your brain. It will continue to increase in concentration with every waking minute that elapses. The longer you are awake, the more adenosine will accumulate. Think of adenosine as a chemical barometer that continuously registers the amount of elapsed time since you woke up this morning. One consequence of increasing adenosine in the brain is an increasing desire to sleep. This is known as sleep pressure, and it is the second force that will determine when you feel sleepy, and thus should go to bed. Using a clever dual-action effect, high concentrations of adenosine simultaneously turn down the “volume” of wake-promoting regions in the brain and turn up the dial on sleep-inducing regions. As a result of that chemical sleep pressure, when adenosine concentrations peak, an irresistible urge for slumber will take hold.VII It happens

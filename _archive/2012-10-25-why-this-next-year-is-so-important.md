The end of November is a strange time to consider the next year of life. I should be doing this on my birthday, or late December, right? Wrong. I have joined the ranks of the unemployed, and I think this is a grand opportunity. This next year is so important because _I must not waste this opportunity_! If I blindly pursue having a job for the sake of having a job, I fail to maximize my opportunity. If I lament, whine, and complain about not having a job, I fail to maximize this opportunity.

This next year is formative in many respects. I will lay down important financial foundations, make career decisions, and learn to better love my wife. The question is not "Will I lay down foundations and build habits" but "what sort of foundations and habits will I create?"

What sort of habits have you built in the last month, and what would you like to change next month?
